'''Kalmyk Buddhist Temple''', also known as '''Kalmyk Home''', was a [[Buddhist temple]] in [[Belgrade]], capital of [[Serbia]]. It was built in 1929 as one of the first Buddhist temples in Europe, served for the religious purposes until 1944, and completely demolished in the mid-1960s.

== Location ==

[[Pagoda]] was located in the neighborhood known today as [[Učiteljsko Naselje]], in [[Zvezdara]] municipality. Učiteljsko Naselje is a section of the larger [[Konjarnik]] neighborhood. The street in which it was based was named ''Budistička'' (Buddhist) after the temple was built, and today is named ''Budvanska'' ([[Budva]] street).<ref name="Politika">{{cite web|url =http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/377038/Potomci-Dzingis-kana-u-Beogradu|title=Potomci Džingis Kana u Beogradu|date=27 March 2017|author=Dimitrije Bukvić|publisher=[[Politika]]|page=9}}</ref>

== Origin of the pagoda ==
[[Image: Kalmyk Temple in Belgrade.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Belgrade Pagoda]]

After the [[October Revolution]] in 1917, a huge number of people from Russia, supporters of the [[White movement]], emigrated to [[Yugoslavia]], including [[Pyotr Wrangel]], general of the [[White Army]]. Among them were hundreds of [[Kalmyks]], [[Western Mongols|Western Mongolian]] people of Buddhist faith, who inhabited the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]]. From April 1920 to late 1923, some 500 Kalmyks entered Serbia, and 400 of them settled in Belgrade, thus creating the largest Kalmyk colony in Europe.<ref name="Politika"/><ref name=Uvod>{{Cite web|url=http://www.members.tripod.com/budisti/uvv2.html|title=Uvod - dolazak Kalmika u Srbiju|website=www.members.tripod.com}}</ref>

They settled on the eastern outskirts of Belgrade: [[Karaburma]], [[Bulbulder]], [[Cvetkova Pijaca]], [[Crveni Krst, Belgrade|Crveni Krst]].<ref name="prvi">{{Citation | title = Kada je otvoren prvi budistički hram u Beogradu? | newspaper = [[Politika]] | language = sr | date = 24 May 2012 }}</ref> However, the majority of them settled in [[Mali Mokri Lug]], the suburban village of Belgrade at the time. Having several priests in their community, already in 1923 they rented rooms in the still existing house in the ''Vojislava Ilića'' street No 47 for religious service.<ref name=early>{{Cite web|url=http://www.members.tripod.com/budisti/ep.htm|title=Kalmyk Buddhist Temple in Belgrade (1929 - 1944) Early Period|website=www.members.tripod.com}}</ref> In 1925 they moved it to ''Metohijska'' street No 51 and started an action for building a proper temple.<ref name="Uvod"/> The Kalmyks were headed by the former colonel of the Russian Imperial Army, Abusha Alekseyev (1886–1938) and the Buddhist elder Manchuda Borinov (1872-1928).<ref name="prvi"/> They officially formed their Belgrade organization in April 1929, and Alekseyev was elected as the chief.<ref name=kalmici/>

Many Kalkmyks worked in the [[brickworks]] owned by the industrialist Miloš Jaćimović (1858-1940) and soon he became a major benefactor of their community. In 1928 he donated the lot on which the temple was built and also provided the building materials, bricks and roof tiles. That same year, Kalmyks were granted permission to build the temple, given to them from both the political and [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] authorities. King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] also helped them financially.<ref name="Politika"/><ref name=kalmici/>

The temple was consecrated on 12 December 1929. The guests included members of the Kalmyk diaspora in [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[France]], so as the representatives of the Russian organizations in Belgrade, including the [[ataman]]s of the [[Don Cossacks]] and the [[Terek Cossacks]], as the Kalmyks in Russian Empire mostly served in the army horse units.<ref name=kalmici/> The temple soon became an attraction, being listed in tourist guides, and the street in which it was built was officially named “Buddhist” street. City government became a financial supporter of the temple, so it was reconstructed and expanded in 1935. The main wall was decorated with two painted deer. Being so far away from Buddhist countries, the temple lacked lots of artifacts needed for the religious service. Through the contacts with the [[Japan]]ese [[envoy (title)|envoy]] to [[Bucharest]], in the neighboring [[Romania]], a large bronze statue of [[Buddha]] arrived from [[Tokyo]] and was consecrated on 25 March 1934.<ref name="Politika"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.members.tripod.com/budisti/1929osv.html|title=Osvecenje hrama: 12. decembar 1929.|website=www.members.tripod.com}}</ref><ref name=prvegodine>{{Cite web|url=http://www.members.tripod.com/budisti/1930.html|title=Prve godine hrama (1930 -1932)|website=www.members.tripod.com}}</ref> With the Buddha statue, additional religious equipment arrived (drums, gongs, etc.), but the shipment was kept at the Customs Office, which asked for the huge amount of money to be paid by the Kalmyks. Ministry of Justice intervened and the Buddhist shipment was declared customs free.<ref name=kalmici/>

== Kalmyks in Belgrade ==

Within the temple, Kalmyks established a Buddhist Spiritual Council, which was a focal point of all local Kalmyks in Serbia but also made connections to Kalmyk communities from other parts of Europe. [[Torghut]] princess Nirjidma visited the temple on 20 September 1933. They also had a Buddhist religious school in the Center and classes of the Kalmyk language.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.members.tripod.com/budisti/29dom.html|title=Kalmicki dom|website=www.members.tripod.com}}</ref>

Due to their appearance, local population colloquially called them “Chinese”. As there was a big discrepancy in the gender ratio of the emigrants, one woman to five men, their number in Belgrade never grew over 500. As a result of the cordial relations the two communities had, there were Kalmyk–Serbian marriages, where Kalmyk men would marry Serbian women. As witnesses from that period reported, children from those marriages had “white complexion inherited from us, and slanty eyes inherited from them”. Pagoda had a beautiful rose garden and when the wind would blow, the [[wind chimes]] would make music. Kalmyks would often serve tea to the neighbors and during the religious holidays they would give presents to the children from the neighborhood.<ref name="Politika"/>

In 1934, following the Buddhist customs, 49 days after the assassination of King Alexander in [[Marseilles]], a service was given as he was a temple’s benefactor. Another benefactor was the 1926-1932 US ambassador to Belgrade, [[John D. Prince]].<ref name="Politika"/>

The Kalmyks soon became known as diligent workers.<ref name=kalmici>{{cite news | author = Olivera Popović | title = Kalmici, naši prvi migranti | trans-title = Kalmyks, our first migrants | newspaper = Politika-Magazin, No. 1119 | pages = 28–29 | language = sr | date = 10 March 2019 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/425342/Kalmici-nasi-prvi-migranti}}</ref> Apart from brickworks, they mostly worked as carters and tailors. Best known Kalmyk in Yugoslavia was Učur Kuljdinov, footballer of the [[FK Jugoslavija]]. They were also known for [[horse breeding]].  When [[Palace Albanija]], which was to be the highest building in the [[Balkans]], was built in 1938-1940, the project envisioned three floors below the ground. As the city government had no machinery required for the job,  they invited the Kalmyks, with their horses and carts, to remove the rubble and earth from the foundation pit.<ref name="Politika"/>

== World War II ==

During the war, relations between the neighbors turned sour. On the one side, Kalmyks sided with the German occupational forces and on the other, city government, which was part of the German-appointed [[Government of National Salvation|puppet regime in Serbia]], stripped them of financial support in 1942 as they were not of “Serbian nationality”. With the advance of [[Yugoslav Partisans]] and [[Soviet Red Army]] in the September 1944, and fearing the reprisals of the latter, some 300 remaining Kalmyks withdrew with German troops, first to Germany and then resettling in [[New Jersey]], United States of America, where they established a new colony.<ref name="Politika"/><ref name=kalmici/><ref name="prvegodine"/><ref>{{cite news | authors = Miloš Jurišić, Snežana Toševa | script-title=sr: Развој и мене Београда на старим разгледницама, фотографијама и мапама | trans-title = Development ans stages of Belgrade on old postcards, photographs and maps | newspaper = Politika-Kulturni dodatak | page = 7 | language = sr | date = 17 October 2020}}</ref> They moved in 1951-1952 and mostly settled in the [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]].

== After 1945 ==

From 12 to 16 October 1944, during the final days of the [[Liberation of Belgrade]], the upper section of the temple was demolished due to the fightings in its vicinity. Since there were no believers left, nor the religious artifacts, new Communist government didn’t consider it to be the temple anymore. In 1950 the dome was completely torn down and the ground level was adapted into the cultural center. Organizations like the [[Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia]] and [[Women's Antifascist Front of Yugoslavia]] held conferences in it, but it was also used for more public venues, like weddings and dancings. Still, even at the late 1950s, the area was colloquially called “Chinese Quarter”. The building was then transferred to the ''Budućnost'' company, which demolished the building completely in the mid-1960s and constructed a new, two-floor building instead. The company set its cooling service in it, but the edifice has been locked and out of use for a long time.<ref name="Politika"/><ref name="Uvod"/><ref name="prvegodine"/>

== Legacy ==
Belgrade pagoda is considered as one of the earliest Buddhist temples in Europe, probably only second after the temple in [[St.Petersburg]], built from 1909 to 1915.<ref>Arash Bormanshinov: "Prvi budstički hram u Evropi"; [[Elista]], Šambala, 5-6/, 1997.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-16|title=Drugi budistički hram u Evropi nalazio se u Beogradu|url=https://www.gradnja.rs/drugi-budisticki-hram-u-evropi-nalazio-se-u-beogradu/|access-date=2020-12-19|website=Gradnja|language=sr-RS}}</ref>

The Kalmyks and their temple are almost completely forgotten today, but still, they were inspiration for several works, including the study ''Kalmyks in Serbia 1920-44'' by Toma Milenković (1998), a novel ''Kaja, Belgrade and the Good American'' by Mirjana Đurđević (2009; “Good American” being US ambassador John D. Prince) and a documentary ''There were Kalmyks in Belgrade once'' by Boško Milosavljević (2012).<ref name="Politika"/> However, in the 2010s, newspapers began to occasionally print articles on Kalmyks, bringing more and more their story to the modern readers and usually referring to the temple as the Belgrade pagoda.

Despite oblivion, Kalmyks left a big mark in modern Belgrade’s etymology. One of the largest modern neighborhoods, [[Konjarnik]] (“horse breeding area”), which fully developed from the 1960s on, is named after the horses Kalmyks used to keep in this area before the war (''konj'' is Serbian for horse).<ref name="Politika"/>
