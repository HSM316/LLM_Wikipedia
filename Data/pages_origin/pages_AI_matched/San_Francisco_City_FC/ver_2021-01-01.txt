==History==

San Francisco City Football Club was founded in 2001 by Jonathan Wright, and entered the [[San Francisco Soccer Football League]] beginning with the 2002 season. After a decade in the competition, the club won back-to-back promotions to reach the SFSFL Premier Division in 2012. On the heels of the club's SFSFL success, and with enthusiasm for soccer mounting in the buildup to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], former SF City player and current club president Jacques Pelham began discussions with members of the San Francisco Football Supporters Association and the San Francisco chapter of [[The American Outlaws]] about building a grassroots, supporter-owned professional soccer club in the city.<ref name=FootySF>{{cite web|title=New Club on the Block: SF City FC!|url=http://www.footysf.com/new-club-on-the-block-sf-city-fc/|website=FootySF|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}</ref>

The club began offering membership in August 2014, but a bid to join the [[National Premier Soccer League]] (NPSL) for the spring 2015 campaign was blocked by [[San Francisco Stompers FC]], who claimed territorial exclusivity in the league. SF City filed a grievance with US Soccer contesting the Stompers' claim. An independent arbiter eventually sided with SF City, but by the time the decision was made the club had already agreed to join the [[US Club Soccer]] NorCal Premier Soccer League.<ref name="MLS Soccer">{{cite web|last1=Rosano|first1=Nicholas|title=US Open Cup: San Francisco City FC bring supporter-owned soccer to the City by the Bay|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2015/04/24/us-open-cup-san-francisco-city-fc-bring-supporter-owned-soccer-city-bay|website=MLS Soccer|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}</ref>

The merger was executed on the eve of the semifinal of the regional US Open Cup qualifying tournament.<ref name="Meet The Underdogs">{{cite web|last1=Ream|first1=Evan|title=Meet The Underdogs: Fan-owned San Francisco City brings US Open Cup, professional aspirations back to city|url=http://thecup.us/meet-the-underdogs-fan-owned-san-francisco-city-brings-us-open-cup-professional-aspirations-back-to-city/|website=The Cup.us|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}</ref>
