'''Operation Top Hat''' was a "local field exercise"<ref name=veterans/> conducted by the [[United States Army Chemical Corps]] in 1953. The exercise involved the use of Chemical Corps personnel to test [[biological warfare|biological]] and [[chemical warfare]] decontamination methods.  These personnel were deliberately exposed to these contaminants, so as to test decontamination.

==Background==
In June 1953 the [[United States Army]] formally adopted guidelines regarding the use of human subjects in chemical, biological, or radiological testing and research.<ref name=veterans/> The guidelines were adopted per an [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] memo (MM 385) and closely mirrored the [[Nuremberg Code]].<ref name=veterans/> These guidelines also required that all research projects involving human subjects receive approval from the [[Secretary of the Army]].<ref name=veterans/> The guidelines, however, left a loophole; they did not define what types of experiments and tests required such approval from the secretary, thus encouraging "selective compliance" with the guidelines.<ref name=veterans>Pechura, Constance M. and Rall, David P.

==Tests==
Under the guidelines, seven research projects involving chemical weapons and human subjects were submitted by the [[Chemical Corps]] for Secretary of the Army approval in August 1953.<ref name=veterans/><ref name=moreno/> One project involved [[vesicant]]s, one involved [[phosgene]], and five were experiments which involved [[nerve agent]]s; all seven were approved.<ref name=veterans/><ref name=moreno/> Operation Top Hat, however, was not among the projects submitted to the Secretary of the Army for approval.<ref name=moreno>[[Jonathan D. Moreno|Moreno, Jonathan D.]] ''Undue Risk: Secret State Experiments on Humans'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhMiN64D96cC&pg=PA179&lpg=PA179&dq=chemical+corps+experiments&source=bl&ots=3M1mHfajnj&sig=H0Op-XgcSlh5ucZhXTXVp4mhyhc&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPA179,M1 Google Books]), Routledge, 2001, pp. 179&ndash;80, ({{ISBN|0415928354}}).</ref>

Operation Top Hat was termed a "local field exercise" by the Army and took place from September 15&ndash;19, 1953 at the [[U.S. Army Chemical School|Army Chemical School]] at [[Fort McClellan]], Alabama.<ref name=veterans/><ref name=moreno/> In a 1975 [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] [[Office of the Inspector General|Inspector General]]'s report, the  military maintained Top Hat was not subject to the guidelines requiring approval because it was a "line of duty" exercise in the Chemical Corps.<ref name=moreno/> The experiments used Chemical Corps personnel to test decontamination methods for biological and chemical weapons,<ref name=moreno/> including [[mustard gas]] and nerve agents.<ref name=veterans/> Chemical Corps personnel participating in the tests were not volunteers and were not informed of the tests.<ref name=veterans/>
