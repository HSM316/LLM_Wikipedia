A '''snagboat''' is a river boat, resembling a [[barge]] with [[superstructure]] for crew accommodations, and deck-mounted [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[Hoist (device)|hoists]] for removing [[snags]] and other obstructions from rivers and other shallow [[waterway]]s.

During the [[American Civil War]], when much of the naval fighting was done on rivers and their tributaries, numerous snagboats were in operation.  {{USS|Benton|1861|6}}, for example, was a commercial snagboat quickly converted by the [[Union Army]] to a river [[gunboat]] when the American Civil War broke out.

===Snagboats of the USA===
[[Bear (snagboat)|Bear]] was a wooden-hulled, [[Stern-wheel steamer|stern-wheel]] steamship that served as a snagboat for the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]].

[[Seizer (snagboat)|Seizer]] was a wooden-hulled, [[Stern-wheel steamer|stern-wheel]] steamship that served as the first snagboat for the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] on the [[Sacramento River]].

''[[W. T. Preston]]'' is a specialized [[paddle steamer|sternwheeler]] that operated as a snagboat, removing log jams and natural debris that prevented river [[navigation]] on several [[Puget Sound]]-area rivers.  She is now the centerpiece of the Snagboat Heritage Center in [[Anacortes, Washington]]. She was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1989.<ref name="nhlsum">

''[[Yuba (snagboat)|Yuba]]'' was a stern-wheeled, shallow draft steamship ordered by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]) to serve as a snagboat on the [[Sacramento River]] after the [[Seizer (snagboat)|''Seizer'']] (240 GRT, 1881), had retired in 1921<ref>{{Cite web|first= |last= |authorlink=   |title=Sacramento River: Snag-Boat: "Seizer"|website=History & Happenings|date=December 12, 2012 |url=http://historyandhappenings.squarespace.com/sacramento-river/?currentPage=3  |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Great Raft===

[[File:Red River Texas.jpg|thumb|Red River, Texas]]

In the early 19th century, settlers found that much of the [[Red River of the South|Red river's]] length in [[Louisiana]] was unnavigable because of a collection of fallen trees that formed a [[Great Raft]] over {{convert|160|mi}} long. In 1839, Captain [[Henry Miller Shreve]] began clearing the log jam, but it was not completely cleared until the 1870s, when [[dynamite]] became available. The river was thereafter navigable, but north of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]] it was restricted to small craft. Removal of the raft further connected the Red and Atchafalaya rivers, accelerating the development of the Atchafalaya River channel.<ref name=Piazza2014>{{cite book|last=Piazza|first=Bryan P|title=The Atchafalaya River Basin: History and Ecology of an American Wetland|year=2014|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|isbn=978-1-62349-039-3}}</ref>

==Canada==
In Canada, many of the rivers of [[British Columbia]] were maintained and kept open for navigation by federal Department of Public Works snagboats. On the [[Fraser River]], in southern British Columbia, a series of [[sternwheeler]] snagboats named ''Samson'' were operated by the Canadian Federal Government from the early 1880s until the retirement of final vessel in the series, the ''Samson V'' in 1980. The Samson V is now preserved as a museum on the waterfront of New Westminster, B.C. and was the last steam -powered stern-wheeler to operate in Canada.   In northern British Columbia, Department of Public Works snagboats operated out of [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]] and cleared the waters of the [[Nass River|Nass]], Ecstall, and [[Skeena river]]s.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

The snag-clearance service was mainly important on the Fraser River because of the large amount of marine traffic. Passenger and freight-carrying sternwheelers operated out of [[New Westminster]] from 1859 until the early 1920s. These lightly built vessels were vulnerable to the woody debris and drift logs that would wash down the river with every spring [[freshet]]. After the 1920s, most of the traffic on the Fraser was tug and barge service along with deep sea shipping in the lower reaches of the river, and a greater portion of the snagboat's assignments was in maintenance of government docks and aids to navigation.  In northern British Columbia, as on the Fraser River, a major part of the snagboat service provided by the Canadian federal government was in support of the [[gillnet]] salmon-fishing industry and the canneries that were built in and around the estuaries of the major rivers. Huge amounts of timber debris would wash down-river every year creating hazards for fishermen and destroying nets.{{cn|date=August 2020}}
