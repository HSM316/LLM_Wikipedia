==History==
Chak Ngaeo has a long history of not less than 200 years. The geography of the community consists of plains surrounded by hills or rolling plains, swamps, canals, and the distance from the seashore is only 8–9 km (4.9–5.5 mi) away, so there are abundant soil, water and forest resources. Thailand's famous poet [[Sunthorn Phu]] (สุนทรภู่) wrote about Chak Ngaeo in his ''"Journey to Muang Klaeng"'' (นิราศเมืองแกลง) in the year of 1807 (the end of the reign of [[King Rama I]] in the early [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin]]) during a visit to his father in Muang Klaeng (now [[Amphoe Klaeng]]), [[Rayong province]]. When he arrived here in the nightfall and have called "Nong Cha Ngaeo" (หนองชะแง้ว; Cha Ngaeo Marsh).

According to the above literature, it can be assumed that "Chak Ngaeo" originated "Cha Ngae" (ชะแง้) which means raising head to look, you must raise your head while looking because the community was located on low plains surrounded by hills. Another assumption is "Chak" means flood plains or scrub forests, maybe forests which re-grow after being cut, "Ngaeo" comes from "Ngew" (งิ้ว; [[Bombax ceiba|cotton trees]]) because cotton trees can be widely seen in this area.

In the before 1960s, not long ago. [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese immigrants]] (mostly [[Teochew people|Teochew]]) who came to live in Thailand. They have settled here and have grown [[cassava]] roots. There are 13 [[tapioca]] flour mills. There are two [[Movie theater|cinemas]], one of which has a chair with 1,000 seats, including there is a [[bus terminus]]. The famous singer of that era went from Bangkok for shows in here, such as [[Suraphol Sombatcharoen]] or [[Waiphot Phetsuphan]]. It is considered that the Chak Ngaeo is prosperous before Pattaya and resulting in a mixture of traditional [[Thai culture]] and [[Chinese culture]].

Later, Chak Ngaeo has stagnated when Pattaya has prospered respectively. People have migrated to new places.<ref name=Ch/>
