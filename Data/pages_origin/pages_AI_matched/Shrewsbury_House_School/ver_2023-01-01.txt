==History==
{{unsourced section|date=December 2022}}
Shrewsbury House School was founded in 1865 by Rev. Henry Wilson, a local clergyman, in the centre of Surbiton and derived its name from the Wilson family’s association with the town of [[Shrewsbury]] in [[Shropshire]].

In 1910 the School moved to Haulkerton, a large Victorian [[Arts and Crafts]] mansion dating, from the mid-nineteenth century, on Ditton Hill. The main house was renamed Shrewsbury House and the School has remained there ever since.

For the next 70 years, the School was operated by a series of private owners, most notably Henry Hamilton-Miller, who gave the School his family coat of arms and the motto ''Alta Peto''. In 1979, the School became a charitable trust, administered by a Board of Governors, known as the Shrewsbury House School Trust.

In 2009, the school took over the pre-preparatory department of nearby [[Milbourne Lodge School]], which was renamed Shrewsbury Lodge School and later Shrewsbury House Pre-Preparatory School, after The Rowans School, Wimbledon, joined the Shrewsbury House School Trust in 2017
