It has a single leaf and a single yellowish-green flower with reddish stripes and occurs in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] [[South Australia]] and [[Tasmania]]. It is similar to ''[[Caladenia necrophylla|C. necrophylla]]'' which occurs in south-east [[South Australia]] and to ''[[Caladenia concinna|C. concinna]]'' from southern [[New South Wales]].

==Description==
''Caladenia dilatata'' is a terrestrial, [[Perennial plant|perennial]], [[deciduous]], [[Herbaceous plant|herb]] with an underground [[tuber]] and a single leaf which is {{convert|60-130|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|6-8|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide with red spots near the base, but which is often dried by flowering time. A single yellowish-green flower with reddish stripes is borne on a flowering stem which is {{convert|200-350|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} tall. The [[sepal]]s and [[petal]]s have brown or yellowish, densely [[Gland (botany)|glandular]], thread-like tips {{convert|5-15|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long. The [[wikt:dorsal|dorsal]] sepal is erect, {{convert|35-50|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2-3.5|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide with a drooping tip. The [[wikt:lateral|lateral]] sepals are {{convert|35-50|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|3-3.5|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} wide near the base then tapered to thread-like tips. The lateral sepals are parallel to each other or crossed. The petals are {{convert|25-35|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1.5-2|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide and curve downwards. The labellum is {{convert|13-17|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long and wide, green near the base, grading to white with a dark maroon tip. There are four or five pairs of thin teeth {{convert|4-5|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long on the sides of the labellum and four densely crowded rows of [[Labellum (botany)|calli]] up to {{convert|1.5|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from November to January.<ref name="RBGV">{{cite web|last1=Jeanes|first1=Jeff|title=''Caladenia dilatata''|url=https://vicflora.rbg.vic.gov.au/flora/taxon/afd1eb17-a9e6-484e-b199-8bc949799c05|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria: Vicflora|accessdate=8 February 2018}}</ref><ref name="Jones">{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=David L.|title=A complete guide to native orchids of Australia including the island territories|date=2006|publisher=New Holland|location=Frenchs Forest, N.S.W.|isbn=1877069124|pages =89–90}}</ref>

==Taxonomy and naming==
''Caladenia dilatata'' was first formally described in 1810 by [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] from a specimen collected at [[Port Dalrymple]] at the mouth of the [[Tamar River]] near [[George Town, Tasmania|Georgetown]]. The description was published in ''[[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae]]''.<ref name=APNI>{{cite web|title=''Caladenia dilatata''|url= https://id.biodiversity.org.au/instance/apni/513053 |publisher=APNI|access-date=11 November 2021}}</ref><ref name="R.Br.">{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Robert|title=Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae|date=1810|location=London|page=325|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/21871#page/193/mode/1up|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>

The [[Botanical nomenclature|specific epithet]] (''dilatata'') is a [[Latin]] word meaning "widened" or "expanded".<ref name="Short">{{cite book |last1=Short |first1=Emma |last2=George |first2=Alex |title=A Primer of Botanical Latin with Vocabulary |url=https://archive.org/details/primerbotanicall00shor |url-access=limited |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, U.K. |isbn=9781107693753 |page=[https://archive.org/details/primerbotanicall00shor/page/n172 157]}}</ref>

A similar species, the endangered ''[[Caladenia tensa|C. tensa]]'' which occurs in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, was formerly included with ''C. dilatata''.<ref name="Environment">{{cite web|title=''Caladenia tensa'' — Greencomb Spider-orchid, Rigid Spider-orchid|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=24390|publisher=Australian Government Department of theEnvironment|accessdate=8 February 2018}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
Green-comb spider-orchid occurs in Victoria, the south-east of South Australia and Tasmania.<ref name="APC" /><ref name="SA" /> It grows in coastal or near-coastal heath and in open forest further inland.<ref name="RBGV" /><ref name="AOR">{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=David L.|title=Contributions to Tasmanian Orchidology|journal=Australian Orchid Research|date=1998|volume=3|issue=2|page=30}}</ref>

==Reproduction==
The flower of this orchid closes after pollination, forming a papery capsule.<ref name=Understorey>{{cite web|title=Under Storey Network|url=http://www.understorey-network.org.au/communities.html?species=Caladenia%20dilatata}}</ref>  Yellow, brown, or black dust-sized seeds are produced in the capsule, which dries and splits open at maturity, releasing millions of seeds that are dispersed by wind or water.<ref name="Understorey" />  However, the seeds only germinate upon infection by [[mycorrhiza]]l fungus, and so few seeds mature into full plants.<ref name="Understorey" />

==Ecology==
The elongated tips of the flower produces sexual attractants and attracts pollinators in [[pseudocopulation]], where the pollinators think the flower is a female.  Thynnid wasps are often attracted to the flower with the notion of copulating with the flower.

''Caladenia dilatata'' has a mutualistic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, where the fungus acquires some nutrition from the orchid, and the orchid requires the fungus to germinate.<ref name="Understorey" />  However, the orchid’s dependence on the fungus is not well known.

Although the orchid’s [[fire ecology]] is not well understood, it is believed that forest fires help clear surrounding vegetation, increasing light levels and temperature at ground level.<ref name="Environment" />  With fewer competing plants, there is also believed to be an increase in moisture levels that can benefit ''Caladenia dilatata''.

==Food==
The [[Kulin languages|Kulin]] name of ''Caladenia dilatata'' is koolin, and its tubers are eaten either raw or baked.<ref name="VVP" /><ref name=Aboriginal2>{{cite book|last=Brough|first=Smyth R|title=The aborigines of Victoria: with notes relating to the habits of the natives of other parts of Australia and Tasmania|year=1878|publisher=John Ferres, Government Printer|location=Melbourne|url=https://archive.org/details/aboriginesofvict01smyt}}</ref>
