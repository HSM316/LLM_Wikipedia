'''''Return of the Beverly Hillbillies''''' (also known as '''''Beverly Hillbillies Solve the Energy Crisis''''') is a 1981 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[comedy film]] based on the 1962â€“1971 [[sitcom]] ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' which reunited original cast members [[Buddy Ebsen]], [[Donna Douglas]] and [[Nancy Kulp]] reprising their characters of [[The_Beverly_Hillbillies#J.D._.22Jed.22_Clampett|Jed Clampett]], [[The_Beverly_Hillbillies#Elly_May_Clampett|Elly May Clampett]] and [[The_Beverly_Hillbillies#Jane_Hathaway|Jane Hathaway]], along with newcomers [[Werner Klemperer]] as C.D. Medford, Ray Young as [[The_Beverly_Hillbillies#Jethro_Bodine|Jethro Bodine]] and [[Imogene Coca]] as Granny's 100-year-old mother; noticeably absent are cast members [[Irene Ryan]] (Granny) and [[Raymond Bailey]] (Milburn Drysdale), who had died in 1973 and 1980 respectively, and [[Max Baer Jr.]] (the original Jethro) who declined to participate.

The film was produced and written by original series creator [[Paul Henning]] and was intended as a [[television pilot|pilot]] for a proposed revival of the series, but this never materialized. ''Return of the Beverly Hillbillies'' premiered as ''The CBS Tuesday Night Movie'' on October 6, 1981.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=YX_daEhlnbsC&pg=PA889&dq=return+of+the+beverly+hillbillies&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi64Iaqg-3PAhWky4MKHQibAQUQ6AEITzAJ#v=onepage&q=return%20of%20the%20beverly%20hillbillies&f=false ''Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010, 2nd edition''] Terrace, Vincent</ref>

==Synopsis==
Following the death of [[The_Beverly_Hillbillies#Granny|Granny]], [[The_Beverly_Hillbillies#J.D._.22Jed.22_Clampett|Jed Clampett]] returned to his roots to live in a backwoods cabin in the town of Bug Tussle rather than living alone at his [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] mansion after having voluntarily divided his massive fortune between daughter [[The_Beverly_Hillbillies#Elly_May_Clampett|Elly May]] and nephew [[The_Beverly_Hillbillies#Jethro_Bodine|Jethro Bodine]], both of whom have remained on the West Coast (Jethro is now a successful Hollywood producer running his own movie studio and Elly May has opened a zoo for her beloved critters). [[The_Beverly_Hillbillies#Jane_Hathaway|Jane Hathaway]], once the personal secretary of banker Mr. Milburn Drysdale of the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills, is now a Washington bureaucrat working for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]].

It is 1981 and the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] is desperate to solve the [[energy crisis]]: they dispatch Jane and her obnoxious and stuffy boss C.D. Medford to search for the secret formula of Granny's powerful home-brewed "[[moonshine|white lightning]]" which they are convinced could be the miracle cure for America's gas crisis. Since Granny died some time ago, Jane and C.D. arrive at Jed's old cabin, hoping to score just a few drops of Granny's medicine. Unfortunately, what little survives is ruined by C.D., and so Jed suggests that they contact either one of the "youngins" in California to see if they have any of Granny's medicine left because someone who sure isn't going to tell them is Granny's 100-year-old "Maw", who now runs an "old ladies" home in Bug Tussle and still holds the moonshine recipe.
