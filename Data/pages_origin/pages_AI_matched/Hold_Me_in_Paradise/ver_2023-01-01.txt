"'''Hold Me in Paradise'''" is the eighth episode of the first season of the [[HBO]] [[television series]] ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'', which premiered on November 7, 2010. It was written by staff writer [[Meg Jackson (screenwriter)|Meg Jackson]] and directed by [[Brian Kirk]]. Nucky attends the [[1920 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention in Chicago]], while Eli fills in for him in Atlantic City.

== Plot ==
[[Nucky Thompson|Nucky]] visits [[Chicago]] as a delegate for the [[1920 Republican National Convention]], where he finds himself intrigued by the candidacy of [[Warren G. Harding]] over more established candidates, including the presumed front-runner [[Leonard Wood]]. Discovering that the married Harding has a daughter out of wedlock with a young woman named [[Nan Britton]], Nucky persuades campaign manager [[Harry Daugherty]] that he can deliver the votes of the [[New Jersey]] delegation in exchange for Daugherty blocking [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Walter Evans Edge|Edge]]'s nomination for the vice-presidency, as Nucky is eager to exact revenge for Edge refusing to give him the road funds for [[Atlantic City]]. He also agrees to hide Nan and her child until Harding is elected president.

Nucky stops by the Four Deuces; while conversing with [[Johnny Torrio|Torrio]] and a federal judge from [[Ohio]], [[Jimmy Darmody|Jimmy]] comes downstairs to deal with an unruly guest and runs into his old patron. Nucky behaves coldly towards Jimmy as he is upset that the latter has never called or sent money to his family, unaware that Van Alden, working out of Atlantic City's post office, has been intercepting the steady stream of money and letters Jimmy sends to Angela. Back home, while collecting money at an illegal [[casino]], Eli walks into an [[armed robbery]] by the D'Alessio brothers and sustains a [[shotgun]] wound while trying to stop them from escaping.

When Nucky learns that Eli has been incapacitated, he asks Jimmy to come back to Atlantic City as his personal enforcer, reminding him that, as an Irishman among Italians, Jimmy will always be an outsider in Torrio's crew. Nucky stresses that he needs Jimmy's help in the intensifying [[wikt:turf war|turf war]] against [[Arnold Rothstein|Rothstein]] and the D'Alessios, offering in return a percentage share in his [[rum-running|bootlegging]] operations and help in dealing with Van Alden's investigation of [[Boardwalk Empire (episode)|Jimmy's heist]]. Jimmy is initially hesitant, but ultimately reconsiders after watching Al and the others speak Italian while playing cards, all while feeling completely left out.

Van Alden's wife, desiring a child even though she is [[infertile]], asks him to pay so she can undergo an expensive operation. He gathers all the money he has intercepted from Jimmy, then mails an envelope to his wife. However, it is soon revealed that he had actually sent the money to Angela; his wife receives a letter in which he informs her that he doesn't want children and won't pay for the surgery. Rothstein prepares for legal trouble over his role in the [[Black Sox Scandal]]. [[Margaret Thompson|Margaret]] has a public spat with Lucy and finds herself entangled in Nucky's affairs when he calls from Chicago and asks her to watch over his office and hide a [[ledger]] that contains every detail of his criminal empire. Margaret spends the entire night sitting at Nucky's desk, and against his instructions, reads the ledger.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
''IGN'' gave the episode a score of 7.5 describing it as "a calm before the storm episode, [it] also succeeds at settling Nucky's political ties by establishing new ones, this time tethered to [[1920 United States presidential election|Warren Harding's Presidential campaign]]. The sky may be the limit on Nucky's political capital, but all he wants are his roads to Atlantic City. And he'll need them, as the war threatens to bring both allies and enemies to Nucky's town."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pirrello |first1=Phil |title=Boardwalk Empire: "Hold Me In Paradise" Review|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/11/08/boardwalk-empire-hold-me-in-paradise-review |website=IGN |access-date=October 24, 2021 |date=November 8, 2010}}</ref>
