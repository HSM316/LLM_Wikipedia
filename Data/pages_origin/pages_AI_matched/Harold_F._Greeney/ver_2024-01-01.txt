{{short description|American biologist}}
'''Harold Francis Greeney III''' (born 1972) is an American biologist best known for establishing the [http://www.yanayacu.org Yanayacu Biological Research Station and Center for Creative Studies] on the eastern slopes of [[Antisana|Antisana volcano]] in [[Ecuador]]. He received his PhD from the Department of Behavioural Ecology, [[University of Wrocław]], Wrocław, Poland in 2008, his MSc from Department of Entomology at [[the University of Arizona]] in 1999, and his BSc at [[Wake Forest University]] in 1993.

He is an author on over 225 peer-reviewed biological research articles concerning the ecology, behavior, and evolution of invertebrate and vertebrate species.<ref>{{cite web|last=Greeney|first=Harold|title=Dr.|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=harold+F.+Greeney&btnG=Search&as_sdt=1%2C21&as_sdtp=on|work=Search|publisher=Google Scholar}}</ref> Greeney's work on the reproductive biology of neotropical birds resulted in a Pamela and Alexander F. Skutch Research Award by the [[Association of Field Ornithologists]] in 2005.  Although he has published information on the nesting behavior of more than 500 species of birds, Greeney is well known for his interest in [[antpitta]]s.

His passion and skill for finding bird nests, especially of rare or difficult to find species, have led to Greeney's participation in several nature documentaries such as [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/hummingbirds-magic-in-the-air/video-full-episode/5475/ ''Hummingbirds: Magic in the Air''], [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/an-original-duckumentary/full-episode/8068/ ''An Original DUCKumentary''], and Hummingbirds: Jewelled Messengers, as either a scientific consultant or in an on-air role.

Along with a group of North American collaborators, Greeney has maintained an active [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]-funded research program entitled Collaborative Research: Caterpillars and Parasitoids in the Andes of Eastern Ecuador<ref>{{cite web|title=NSF Awards|url=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/piSearch.do?SearchType=piSearch&page=1&QueryText=yanayacu&PIFirstName=&PILastName=&PIInstitution=&PIState=&PIZip=&PICountry=&Restriction=0&Search=Search|publisher=National Science Foundation}}</ref> since 2004.

Greeney is married and has three children.
