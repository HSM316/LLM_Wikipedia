The '''Direttorio Divisioni Superiori''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for ''Directory of Higher Divisions'') was the ruling body of the major Italian [[association football|football]] championships during the [[fascist era]].<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/calcio_res-43848e5a-8b74-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/ ''Treccani'' (Italian)]</ref>

==History==
The Directory was established through the [[CONI]] by the fascists. Italy was turning into a dictatorship, and the government imposed the new system to the sport too. In 1926 the FIGC had huge problems of governance, and the authorities profited by the situation to disband the Leagues replacing them with appointed committees.

The Directory organized the first football at national level, abolishing the division between North and South, and it legalized the professional football. A new championship was created, the [[Divisione Nazionale]], alongside the diminished [[Prima Divisione]]. The first one was divided between [[Serie A]] and [[Serie B]] in 1929, while the second one was substituted by the [[Serie C]] in 1935.

[[World War II]] interrupted the championships in 1943. At the fall of fascism in 1945, the Directory was automatically abolished. The [[Lega Calcio]] was created in its place in 1946.
