'''Michael Shea''' (born November 4, 1952) is an American former [[child actor]].  Beginning a prolific career at the age of ten, Shea is perhaps best known for portraying the title role in the [[NBC]] children's television series, ''[[The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', as well as for his feature film roles; as Nick in the [[Ivan Tors]] family film, ''[[Namu, the Killer Whale]]'', as Jimmy in the [[MGM]] western, ''[[Welcome to Hard Times (film)|Welcome to Hard Times]]'', and as "Cav" in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney]] drama, ''[[Ride a Northbound Horse]]''.  Although born and raised in [[New York City]], Shea was primarily cast as the wholesome small-town "country boy" throughout most of his career as a child star.

==Early life==
Michael Shea was born on November 4, 1952 (some sources mistakenly reporting his year of birth as 1951) in [[Glendale, New York]] to parents Mr. and Mrs. Frank Shea.<ref name="Oscala Star-Banner 1">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z-EpAAAAIBAJ&pg=4388,7345602|title='Huck Finn' Star At Six-Gun Territory|author=|date=December 29, 1968|work=Oscala Star-Banner}}</ref><ref name="Oscala Star-Banner 2">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yOEpAAAAIBAJ&pg=4356,5113436|title='Huck Finn' TV Star At Six-Gun|author=|date=December 19, 1968|work=Oscala Star-Banner}}</ref><ref name="The Evening Independent">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fVVQAAAAIBAJ&pg=5395,438327|title=Scene Action - Michael Shea and Kevin Schultz?|author=|date=January 2, 1969|work=The Evening Independent}}</ref>  He spent his early years raised in New York and grew up with four siblings, two brothers and two sisters.<ref name="Oscala Star-Banner 1"/><ref name="The Evening Independent"/>  When Shea was nine years old, a neighbor reportedly approached him with the idea of entering show business; however, the thought of stardom frightened him.  In a 1968 interview, Shea recalled the early experience saying, "I ran into the woods and started crying.  I kept saying, 'I don't want to be a star.'"<ref name="Oscala Star-Banner 1"/>

==Career==

===Early career===
At the age of ten, Shea reconsidered the possibilities of a professional acting career. In 1968, he recounted his reasoning saying, "I thought I'd like to try acting, but I wasn't sure I'd want to stay in it, so I asked my neighbor if I could get out if I didn't like it.  He said 'sure.'"  Shea's neighbor was Aliam Dunn, casting director of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', who used his industry connections to introduce Shea to a New York talent agent.  Soon, Shea was landing work as a child model and actor, appearing in television commercials for [[Campbell's Soup]] and [[Scooter Pie]]s among others.<ref name="Oscala Star-Banner 1"/><ref name="Los Angeles Times">{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60264050.html?dids=60264050:60264050&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+27%2C+1993&author=BOB+POOL&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=Former+Actor+Gets+New+Role+for+Hollywood+Parade&pqatl=google|title=Former Actor Gets New Role for Hollywood Parade|author=|date=November 27, 1993|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

After learning the show business ropes as a working actor in commercials, Shea made his theatrical debut, appearing in two "experimental" [[off-Broadway]] productions by [[Edward Albee]], and made his television debut in ''[[The Bell Telephone Hour]]'' Christmas special.<ref name="Oscala Star-Banner 1"/><ref name="The Evening Independent"/><ref name="The Deseret News">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LMROAAAAIBAJ&pg=4935,3890858|title=Right Out of Pages of Mark Twain Book|author=|date=September 18, 1968|work=The Deseret News}}</ref>  In 1965, Shea was signed to play the title role in a proposed western television series titled ''Joshua'', which prompted the Shea family to relocate from its New York home to California.<ref name="Oscala Star-Banner 1"/><ref name="Oscala Star-Banner 2"/><ref name="Los Angeles Times"/>  However the series never made it to television.<ref name="Oscala Star-Banner 1"/>

===Breakthrough===
After Shea was released from his obligations for ''Joshua'', the family remained in California where he was soon landing guest-starring roles on such popular television shows of the time as ''[[Blue Light (TV series)|Blue Light]]'', ''[[Camp Runamuck]]'', and ''[[The Fugitive (1963 TV series)|The Fugitive]]''.<ref name="Oscala Star-Banner 1"/><ref name="Oscala Star-Banner 2"/>  In 1966, Shea made his feature film debut in the [[Ivan Tors]] family drama ''[[Namu, the Killer Whale]]'' appearing as Nick, one of the antagonists to a family caring for a [[killer whale]], inciting fear and hostility within their small seaside community.<ref name="Oscala Star-Banner 1"/><ref name="Oscala Star-Banner 2"/><ref name="The Sumter Daily Item">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FowiAAAAIBAJ&pg=2028,879245|title=Namu - Tamed|author=|date=January 9, 1971|work=The Sumter Daily Item}}</ref>

In 1970, Shea made two appearances on the television series ''[[Headmaster (TV series)|Headmaster]]'' and in 1971, began a recurring role as [[Dick Van Dyke]]'s son Lucas Preston for two seasons on ''[[The New Dick Van Dyke Show]]''.<ref name="The News and Courier">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nYRJAAAAIBAJ&pg=799,228784|title=Amusements - The New Dick Van Dyke Show|author=|date=October 2, 1971|work=The News and Courier}}</ref><ref name="The Boston Globe">{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/1946377872.html?FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Jan+28%2C+1973&author=&pub=Boston+Globe+(1960-1979)&desc=Other+53+--+No+Title&pqatl=google|title=TV Week - Today|author=|date=January 28, 1973|work=The Boston Globe}}</ref><ref name="The Palm Beach Post">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XAAtAAAAIBAJ&pg=3007,3546694|title=Guests Chosen for Personality - The New Dick Van Dyke Show|author=|date=May 26, 1984|work=The Palm Beach Post}}</ref>  During this time, Shea also continued to guest-star on other popular series of the time, appearing on two episodes of the high school drama series ''[[Room 222]]'', as well as appearing in two episodes of the religious anthology series ''[[Insight (American TV series)|Insight]]'', the second of which would be his final television appearance in the July 1973 episode entitled "Celebration in Fresh Powder".

==Personal life==
After ''Huck Finn'' ended, Shea attended classes at [[Van Nuys High School]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]] where he lived with his family.<ref name="The Evening Independent"/><ref name="The Hartford Courant"/>  Shea graduated from Van Nuys High School in 1971 and, after leaving show business in 1973, began working in a patio furniture shop in [[Studio City, Los Angeles]].<ref name="Los Angeles Times"/>  In 1979, Shea became a police officer with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]].<ref name="Los Angeles Times"/>

In 1993, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that one of Shea's duties with the LAPD included serving as the head of security for celebrities riding in the [[Hollywood Christmas Parade]], exactly 25 years after he'd ridden in the same parade himself as the celebrity guest of honor during the height of his ''Huck Finn'' fame.  In the same article, the ''L.A. Times'' also reported that Shea was married and resided in [[Castaic, California]] with his wife and children.<ref name="Los Angeles Times"/>

In September 2010, the [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] [[Chamber of Commerce]] posted a video on its official YouTube channel of Shea at the 7th Annual Hollywood PAL Benefit where he had been honored for his "incredible dedication and hard work" and "community involvement" as a law enforcement officer.
