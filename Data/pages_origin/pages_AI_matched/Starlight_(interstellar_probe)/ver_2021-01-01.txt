{{short description|UCSB study of fleet of small laser light sail interstellar probes}}

'''Project Starlight''' is a research project of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] to develop a fleet of laser beam-propelled spacecraft and sending them to a star neighboring the Solar System, potentially [[Alpha Centauri]]. The project aims to send organisms on board the spacecraft.<ref name="economist2017">{{cite news |date=November 2, 2017 |title=The first voyager to another star may be a worm or a tardigrade |url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21730862-life-fast-lane-first-voyager-another-star-may-be-worm-or |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |accessdate=2017-12-25}}</ref>

==Overview==
Starlight aims to accelerate the spacecraft with powerful lasers, a method the project refers to as [[DEEP-IN]] (Directed Energy Propulsion for Interstellar Exploration),<ref name="starlightpage">{{cite web |url=http://www.deepspace.ucsb.edu/projects/starlight |title=Starlight Directed Energy for Relativistic Interstellar Missions |publisher=[[University of California, Santa Barbara]] |access-date=2017-12-25}}</ref> thus allowing them to reach stars near the Solar System in a matter of years, in contrast to traditional propulsion methods which will require thousands of years. Each spacecraft will be the size of a DVD disc and will be powered by plutonium.<ref name="economist2017"/> They will fly at one-fifth of the speed of light, and in the case of Alpha Centauri, it will arrive after traveling more than twenty years from Earth.<ref name="economist2017"/> 

==History==
Starlight is a program of the Experimental Cosmology Group of [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB), and has received funding from NASA.<ref name="economist2017"/> In 2015, the [[NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts]] (NIAC) selected DEEP-IN as a phase-1 project.<ref name="niac2015">{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/deep-in-directed-energy-propulsion-for-interstellar-exploration |title=DEEP IN Directed Energy Propulsion for Interstellar Exploration |publisher=NASA |access-date=2017-12-25}}</ref>

==Terrestrial biomes in space==

One goal of Starlight is to send terrestrial organisms along with the spacecraft, and observe how the interstellar environment and extreme acceleration affects them. This effort is known as ''Terrestrial Biomes in Space'', and the lead candidate is ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', a minuscule [[nematode]].<ref name="economist2017"/> The organism will spend most of the voyage in a frozen state, and once the spacecraft approaches its target they will be thawed by heat from the onboard plutonium.<ref name="economist2017"/> Following their revival, the organisms will be monitored by various sensors, and the data they produce will be sent back to Earth. ''C. elegans'' have been used extensively in biological research as a [[model organism]], owing to the fact that the worm is one of those having the fewest cells for an animal possessing a nervous system. A backup option for ''C. elegans'' are [[tardigrade]]s, [[micro-animals]] that are known for their resilience to various conditions lethal to other animals, such as the vacuum environment of space and strong doses of ionizing radiation.<ref name="economist2017"/>

===Planetary protection===
NASA's funding does not cover the ''Terrestrial Biome in Space'' portion of Starlight, as the experiment may potentially contaminate [[exoplanets]].<ref name="economist2017"/>
