The '''Statue of Hope''' is an [[allegorical figure]] that is typically a private [[memorial]] or [[monument]] displayed in a [[graveyard]] or [[cemetery]]. [[Hope]] is one of the [[Seven Virtues]] of the [[Christian religion]].

==History==

Most commonly used in the [[Victorian era]] and believed to be popularized by the [[Statue of Liberty]]'s dedication in 1886. Prior to this, other images such as [[Saint Philomena]] whose authorization of devotion began in 1837 <ref>''It is Time to Meet St. Philomena'' By Dr. Mark Miravalle 2007</ref> and Danish sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]'s Goddess of Hope statue sculpted in 1817,<ref>''Kierkegaard and His Contemporaries'': Pages 375–405; Thorvaldsen: An Introduction to his Work 2003</ref> displayed similar characteristics.

One of the earliest signed Statue of Hope memorials was carved by [[Odoardo Fantacchiotti]] in 1863 for the [[Grave (burial)|grave]] of Samuel Reginald Routh of [[England]] in the [[Protestant]] Cemetery of [[Florence]], Italy.<ref>''Thunders of White Silence, the Protestant cemetery of Florence, Italy'', Julia Bolton Holloway 2010</ref> Another variation was completed in 1791. The [[Custom House, Dublin]] [[Ireland]] features a 16 foot (about 5 meter) tall statue of a female resting on an anchor atop the dome. This statue has been called both the Statue of Hope<ref>"The Catholic World", The Catholic Publication House, New York, Page 831, Vol. XIX April–September 1874</ref> and the Statue of Commerce.<ref>"The Encyclopædia Britannica", The Sixth Edition, Page 367, Vol. VII, 1823</ref>

==Construction==

In the [[United States]], these statues were commonly carved out of limestone or [[marble]] and were usually unsigned. The Wilson memorial pictured on the right was sculpted using [[Indiana Limestone]] which was quarried nearby. Towards the latter part of the 19th and early 20th century, some were cast with [[zinc]], commonly referred to as [[White Bronze]].<ref>The Foundry Magazine, Vol.35 No. 5, January 1910, Cleveland, Ohio</ref>

==Religious symbolism==

A female, typically shown wearing [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Stola]] and [[Palla (garment)|Palla]] garments, stands with one arm resting on or holding an [[anchor]]. This is often an [[Anchored cross]] meaning hope<ref>Keister, Douglas, ''Stories in Stone: A Field Guide to Cemetery Symbolism and Iconography''. Layton, UT: Gibbs Smith Publishers, 2004</ref> and is the primary symbol of the statue. Further, the [[New Testament]], Hebrews 6:19 states ''Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil.''<ref>Smith, William and Cheetam, Samuel, ''A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities'', London, England: J. R Burr Publishing Co., Page 81, Vol.1, 1880</ref> Often, the opposite arm is raised with the index finger of the hand pointing towards the sky. This symbolizes the pathway to heaven. A hand held over the heart symbolizes faith. Other key elements can be a broken chain attached to the anchor or sometimes hanging from the neck. This symbolizes the cessation of life. Many statues have a single [[five pointed star]] rather than a [[circle of stars]]. The [[Star (heraldry)|star]] is on the top of the forehead, usually on a [[Crown of Immortality]] or [[diadem]], and represents the immortal [[soul]].<ref>''Memorial Art, Ancient and Modern'', Harry A Bliss 1912</ref>
