'''Charles M. McDonald''' (1867 &ndash; October 6, 1936) was a Canadian politician who served in the [[Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan]] and in the [[Parliament of Canada]]. He has the distinction of having served in both the [[House of Commons of Canada]] and the [[Senate of Canada]] for less than a year.

McDonald was a pharmacist by profession. He was born in [[Scotland]] and immigrated to Canada. By the time of the 1901 census he was living in [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]] with his wife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metisnationdatabase.ualberta.ca/MNC/Census1901.jsp?recordId%3D4860%26recordTypeRaw%3D90120CE |title=MNC Historical Online Database - Census 1901 Records |accessdate=2009-08-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210224/http://metisnationdatabase.ualberta.ca/MNC/Census1901.jsp?recordId=4860&recordTypeRaw=90120CE |archivedate=2011-07-06 }}</ref>

He first attracted public attention in 1918 when he assisted in the capture of two bandits sought for the slaying of a law enforcement officer.<ref name=star>"Senator C. M'Donald Dies in Vancouver", ''Toronto Daily Star'', October 7, 1936</ref>

He was first elected to the Saskatchewan legislature as a [[Saskatchewan Liberal Party|Liberal]] MLA in the [[1917 Saskatchewan general election|1917 provincial election]] representing [[Prince Albert City|the provincial constituency of Prince Albert]] and was re-elected in the [[1921 Saskatchewan general election|1921 provincial election]] by [[acclamation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saskarchives.com/web/seld/Elections-Results-by-Electoral-Division.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716005755/http://www.saskarchives.com/web/seld/Elections-Results-by-Electoral-Division.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}</ref>

After two terms in the Saskatchewan legislature, McDonald switched to federal politics and contested the [[Prince Albert (electoral district)|federal riding of Prince Albert]] in the [[1925 Canadian federal election|1925 federal election]] and was elected with more than 50% of the vote defeating both incumbent [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive]] MP [[Andrew Knox (Canadian politician)|Andrew Knox]] and [[John Diefenbaker]], the [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867â€“1942)|Conservative]] candidate and future prime minister.

The [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]] were re-elected with a [[minority government]]. Despite having fewer seats than the Conservatives they were able to stay in power with the support of Progressive and independent MPs. However, Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] was personally defeated in his riding of [[York North]] and needed to find a new constituency. On January 15, 1926, McDonald agreed to resign his seat immediately after his election so that Mackenzie King could contest it in a [[by-election]] which was held a month later.

McDonald returned to his pharmacy and eventually moved to [[British Columbia]]. In December 1935, Prime Minister Mackenzie King, who had just been returned to government after five years of Tory rule, appointed McDonald to the Canadian Senate as a representative for British Columbia. However, McDonald's tenure was short lived as he died in office less than a year later. His combined service in both the House of Commons and the Senate is 361 days.<ref>[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=cf5757bd-25a0-4d2d-945f-8d279a69537a&Language=E&MenuID=Lists.Members.aspx&MenuQuery=http%3A%2F%2Fwww2.parl.gc.ca%2FParlinfo%2FLists%2FMembers.aspx%3FParliament%3D%26Riding%3D%26Name%3Dm%26Party%3D%26Province%3D%26Gender%3D%26New%3DFalse%26Current%3DFalse%26Picture%3DFalse%26Language%3DE Parliamentary biography]</ref>
