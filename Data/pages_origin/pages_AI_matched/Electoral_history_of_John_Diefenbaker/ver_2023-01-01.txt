[[File:John G. Diefenbaker.jpg|thumb|right|John Diefenbaker in 1957, the year he became Prime Minister.]]
This article is the '''Electoral history of [[John Diefenbaker]]''', the thirteenth [[Prime Minister of Canada]].

A [[conservatism in Canada|Progressive Conservative]], he served one term as Prime Minister (1957–1963), defeating [[Louis St. Laurent]].  He won three general elections (1957, 1958 and 1962), with one majority government and two minority governments.  He lost the 1963 election to [[Lester Pearson]], who succeeded him as prime minister.  Diefenbaker led the party one last time in the 1965 election, but was again defeated by Pearson.

He stood for election to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] fifteen times.  He was defeated in his first two attempts (1925, 1926), but he was elected on his third try, in 1940.  Thereafter, he was elected an additional twelve times, until he died in office in 1979.

Diefenbaker sought the leadership of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] three times, unsuccessfully in 1942 and 1948, before winning it in 1957.  Following the loss in the election in 1965, the party held a leadership convention in 1967 which he lost, ending his leadership of the Progressive Conservative party.  [[Robert Stanfield]] succeeded him as party leader.

Prior to election to the House of Commons, Diefenbaker was also involved in Saskatchewan provincial politics and municipal politics, but with little success.

== Summary ==
[[File:Canada provinces 1949-1999.png|thumb|right|Canada had ten provinces and two territories throughout Diefenbaker's time as Prime Minister.]]

Diefenbaker ranks tenth out of twenty-three prime ministers for [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada by time in office|time in office]], serving one term of five years and 305 days.<ref>[https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/primeMinisters PARLINFO:  Prime Ministers of Canada.]</ref>

Diefenbaker is the only prime minister from [[Saskatchewan]].

In 1920, Diefenbaker began his political career, starting with municipal politics.   At age 25, he was elected to the village council of [[Wakaw, Saskatchewan]], where he operated his first law practice.

Diefenbaker would not win another election for twenty years.  In the intervening two decades, he lost five elections:  two at the federal level, two at the provincial level, and one at the municipal level.  It was not until 1940 that he finally won his second election, to the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]].  From that point on, he never lost an election at the constituency level, winning thirteen straight elections to the Commons. Diefenbaker eventually died in office as a Member of Parliament.

At the federal level, Diefenbaker stood for election in the general elections of 1925 and 1926, but was defeated both times.  In the 1926 election, his Liberal opponent was the former prime minister, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]].  This is the only time two future prime ministers have directly opposed each other in the same riding.  After his election loss, Diefenbaker was a delegate to the [[Conservative leadership convention, 1927|1927 Conservative convention]] which chose [[R.B. Bennett]] as leader of the party.  He also campaigned for the party in the 1935 election.<ref name = DCB>[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=7990 ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography:''  "Diefenbaker, John George."]</ref>

Diefenbaker was also very active, but unsuccessful, in provincial politics.  He stood for election in the provincial election of 1929, but was defeated.  In 1933 he was elected vice-president of the [[Saskatchewan Conservative Party]].  After the Conservatives were wiped out in the provincial election of 1934, he became the acting president of the party.  In 1936, at the leadership convention, he was acclaimed as the leader of the party.  He led the party in the provincial election of 1938, running in the constituency of [[Arm River (electoral district)|Arm River]], but he and the party were both defeated.  No Conservatives were elected to the Legislative Assembly and the party earned only 12% of the provincial popular vote.  At the subsequent party convention four months after the election, Diefenbaker offered his resignation but it was refused.  The Conservatives were so decimated by the previous two elections that they had few members or supporters.  He remained leader of the party for the next two years.<ref name = DCB/>

In 1933, he ran for the mayor of [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]], but was defeated by 48 votes.<ref name = DCB/>

In 1940, Diefenbaker was elected to the House of Commons, for the riding of [[Lake Centre (electoral district)|Lake Centre]].  Entering the Commons, he soon showed his leadership aspirations beginning with the [[Progressive Conservative leadership convention, 1942|Progressive Conservative leadership convention of 1942]].  Although unsuccessful, he tried again in [[Progressive Conservative leadership convention, 1948|1948]] and [[Progressive Conservative leadership convention, 1956|1956]].  In 1942 he came in third;  in 1948 he came in second;  and in 1956 he won the leadership.  He would hold the leadership for eleven years, eventually being forced out at the [[1967 Progressive Conservative leadership election|1967 convention]], after the two losses in the general elections of 1963 and 1965.<ref name = DCB/>

Diefenbaker was elected to the Commons thirteen times (1940, 1945, 1949, 1953, 1957, 1958, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1968, 1972, 1974, and 1979), from 1940 until his death shortly after the election of 1979.  For eight straight elections (1957, 1958, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1972, and 1974), he won majorities even in multi-candidate races.  In four of those contests, he won majorities of over 65% (72.1% in 1958, 70.8% in 1962, 71.4% in 1963, and 65.5% in 1965).

He served in the House of Commons for a total of 39 years, 4 months, and 21 days.<ref>[https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/Profile?personId=2369 PARLINFO:  The Right Hon. John George Diefenbaker.]</ref>

== Federal general elections: 1957 to 1965 ==

Diefenbaker led the Progressive Conservatives in five general elections.  He was successful in the general elections of [[1957 Canadian federal election|1957]], [[1958 Canadian federal election|1958]], and [[1962 Canadian federal election|1962]], but was defeated in the elections of [[1963 Canadian federal election|1963]] and [[1965 Canadian federal election|1965]].

Diefenbaker led the Progressive Conservatives in the general election of 1957.  The election resulted in a [[hung parliament|minority government]], with no party having a majority.  Although the Liberals came in first in the popular vote, they came in second in seats in the House of Commons, behind Diefenbaker and the Progressive Conservatives.  St. Laurent resigned and Diefenbaker formed a minority government, ending twenty-three years of Liberal rule.

After two years of minority government, Pearson and the Liberals called an election.  The result was another [[hung parliament]].  The Liberals increased their seat total, but again fell short of an outright majority, this time by two seats.  Pearson governed as a minority government.  Diefenbaker initially continued as leader of the Opposition, but in 1966 he was ousted by a party revolt.  [[Robert Stanfield]] succeeded him as party leader.
