The '''Praça Diogo de Vasconcelos''' or '''Praça da Savassi''' ('''Diogo de Vasconcelos Square''' or '''Savassi Square''') is a [[public square]] of [[Savassi]], in the city of [[Belo Horizonte]].

It is located at the confluence of the avenues Cristóvão Colombo and Getúlio Vargas. Also there flow the streets Pernambuco and Antônio de Albuquerque.

Its name honors the politician and historian Diogo de Vasconcelos, which stood out as a pioneer in defense of the historical and artistic heritage, mining and national level and is considered the first historian of art in [[Brazil]].<ref>[http://www.hojeemdia.com.br/cmlink/hoje-em-dia/minas/praca-da-savassi-tera-plastica-radical-1.105917 Praça da Savassi terá Plástica Radical] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319194335/http://www.hojeemdia.com.br/cmlink/hoje-em-dia/minas/praca-da-savassi-tera-plastica-radical-1.105917 |date=2012-03-19 }}</ref>

The square a lively meeting place for ''belorizontinos'', since it is located in the center of the neighborhood of [[Savassi]], an important commercial city. The wide range of patrons range from families who go shopping or to the cafes and restaurants in the area until the young bohemian who frequents the bars or spend the weekend nights on the banks of the square.

Although its official name is '''Square Diogo de Vasconcelos''', this name is not very widespread popularity. The name ''Square Savassi'' derives from the Bakery Savassi who had a seat at the corner of Rua Pernambuco with avenida Cristóvão Colombo. The marquee's original bakery could still be seen on the site, behind the plate''boutique''Toulon until the installation of a coffee shop Arturo's, when it was removed.

Since 2006, the site that once housed mostly boutiques, restaurants and snack bars, shops was invaded by mobile companies. The patrons of the traditional ''Café Três Corações'' (Three Hearts Café) came to protest against its closure at the site due to the opening of a store operator [[Claro Americas|Claro]]. After the protest, the cafe has been reopened in a smaller area, corresponding to a small fraction of the old facility, with access only by Rua Antonio de Albuquerque.<ref>[http://www.hojeemdia.com.br/cmlink/hoje-em-dia/minas/praca-da-savassi-tera-r-7-4-mi-1.122357 Hoje em Dia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319194347/http://www.hojeemdia.com.br/cmlink/hoje-em-dia/minas/praca-da-savassi-tera-r-7-4-mi-1.122357 |date=2012-03-19 }}</ref>
