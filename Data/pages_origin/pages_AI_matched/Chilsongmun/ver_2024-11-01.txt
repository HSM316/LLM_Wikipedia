'''Ch'ilsŏng Gate''' ({{Korean|hangul=칠성문}}) is the northern gate of the inner castle of the walled city of [[Pyongyang]] ([[Pyongyang Castle]]). Located in the scenic [[Moranbong Park]], the gate was originally built in the sixth century as an official [[Koguryo]] construction, although present construction dates from 1712.

The gate takes its name (which literally means "seven stars") from the seven brightest stars in the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]] constellation (also known as the [[Big Dipper]]). This constellation was revered in traditional Korean religion - for example, many [[Buddhism in Korea|Buddhist]] [[Korean Buddhist temples|temples]] in Korea contain a "Chilsong shrine" or other similar structure.

Ch'ilsŏng Gate is [[National treasures of North Korea|National Treasure #18]] in North Korea.
