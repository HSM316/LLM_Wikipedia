'''Playscape Racing''' was an Australian motor racing team that competed in [[Australian Touring Car Championship|Australian touring car racing]] between [[1989 Australian Touring Car season|1989]] and [[1998 Australian Touring Car season|1998]].

==History==
At the [[1988 Bathurst 1000]], explosives entrepreneur Kevin Waldock's Blast Dynamics came on board as a sponsor of [[Miedecke Motorsport]]’s [[Ford Sierra RS500]]. For [[1989 Australian Touring Car Championship|1989]], Waldock contracted Miedecke Motorsport to build and maintain customer RS500. However following the destruction of Andrew Miedecke's own car at [[Lakeside International Raceway|Lakeside]], this car was taken over by Miedecke and another car built for Waldock, debuting at the [[1989 Pepsi 300|Oran Park 300]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 9|year=1990|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref>

The car was painted yellow, a livery all Playscape Racing cars would carry. Following Miedecke closing the team and joining [[Holden Dealer Team#Group A|Mobil 1 Racing]], Waldock formed his own team on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] with Miedecke Motorsport personnel including [[Stone Brothers Racing#The Stone Brothers|Ross and Jim Stone]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 10|year=1991|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref><ref>[http://www.speedcafe.com/2012/12/15/stones-not-ready-to-roll-away-from-v8-supercars-racing/ Stones not ready to roll away from V8 Supercars racing] Speedcafe 15 December 2012</ref> In 1991, Playscape finished third at the [[1991 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]] and fifth at the [[1991 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 11|year=1992|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref>

With the arrival of the [[V8 Supercars]] era, a [[Ford Falcon (EB)|Ford EB Falcon]] was built in [[Auckland]] debuting at the [[1993 Sandown 500]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 13|year=1994|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref><ref>[http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/saturday-sleuthing-the-kiwi-built-falcon Saturday Sleuthing: The Kiwi-Built Falcon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022103811/http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/saturday-sleuthing-the-kiwi-built-falcon |date=22 October 2014 }} V8 Supercars 22 December 2012</ref> Two years later, Playscape debuted an [[Ford Falcon (EF)|EF Falcon]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 15|year=1995|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120409142908/http://www.v8supercars.com.au/championship/newsarticle/saturday-sleuthing-waldocks-komatsu-falcon/tabid/70/newsid/12328/default.aspx Saturday Sleuthing: Waldock's Komatsu Falcon] V8 Supercars 7 April 2012</ref> The team would appear in selected rounds of the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] as well as the [[Bathurst 1000]].

Waldock had suffered from heart related health issues, being forced to miss Bathurst in [[1993 Bathurst 1000|1993]] and [[1998 FAI 1000|1998]], with the latter being the team's last appearance.
