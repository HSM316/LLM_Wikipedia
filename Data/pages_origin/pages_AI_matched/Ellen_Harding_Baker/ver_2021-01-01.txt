===Solar System Quilt===

In 1876, Ellen Harding created the Solar System Quilt to assist her during astronomy lectures.

She may be the woman from local newspapers in the winter of 1883–1884, which mentioned that it took seven years for an Iowa woman to embroid the Solar System on a quilt.<ref name=sevenyears>{{cite web|url=http://barbarabrackman.blogspot.com/2018/04/solar-system-quilt.html |title=Solar System Quilt |publisher=barbarabrackman.blogspot.com |author=Barbara Morgan |date=April 20, 2018}}</ref>

The quilt has a wool top embellished with wool-fabric applique, wool braid, and wool and silk embroidery. The quilt bears a striking design which resembles illustrations in astronomy books of her period.<ref name=":0" /> The quilt shows the sun at the center and the eight planets of our solar system (with indicated orbits around the sun), as well as the asteroid belt. The myriad of stars that exist beyond our solar system are also shown. The [[Galilean moons]] of Jupiter, as well as moons of Earth, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus are included, as are Saturn's rings. A comet with an eccentric orbit is also present - perhaps [[Halley's Comet|Halley's comet]] which had last been seen in 1835.

The quilt is large; it measures 89 x 106 inches (225 cm x 269 cm).<ref name=":0" />

The quilt is currently in possession at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[National Museum of American History]], donated by Patricia Hill McCloy and Kathryn Hill Meardon.<ref name=":0" /> However, since 2018 it has not been on view.
