=== Military service ===
Ertel served in the [[United States Army]], first in the [[Infantry Branch (United States)|Infantry]] and then as a public affairs representative, and took part in Army operations during the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]]; during Operation Able Sentry, in which the United States established a base in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] to monitor sanctions against [[Serbia]]; and in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] during the [[Bosnian War]]. In the Army, he earned the Meritorious Service Madal, Army Commendation Medal (w/olcand the Army Achievement Medal (w/2olc), among other honors. Ertel undertook training at the [[Defense Information School]].

== Career ==
Ertel returned to Seminole County, where he continued his work in public affairs. After a trio of hurricanes hit Florida in 2004, he was contracted to conduct post-disaster media relations for [[Visit Florida]], which was closely affiliated with the Florida Commission on Tourism.

When longtime Seminole County Supervisor of Elections Sandy Goard resigned from her office in 2003, Dennis Joyner was appointed as her replacement. However, in 2005 Joyner announced his resignation as Supervisor of Elections in a letter to then-Governor [[Jeb Bush]], noting, "My physicians have advised that I [resign] immediately," which was effective on January 10.<ref>{{cite news |title= Seminole County election supervisor resigns, cites health reasons |url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/apnews/stories/010705/D87F2FT82.shtml |publisher=Florida Times-Union|date=January 7, 2005}}</ref> Ertel, along with a number of other individuals, applied for the appointment to fill Joyner's position, and he was appointed by Governor Bush to serve a two-year term until the next general election.<ref>{{cite news |title= Bush Appoints Runner-up To Elections Post |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2005/02/08/bush-appoints-runner-up-to-elections-post/ |publisher=Orlando Sentinel|date=February 8, 2005}}</ref>

In 2006, Ertel ran for re-election against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] activist Marian Williams, who had run two years prior. He was endorsed by the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', which praised him for the fact that he "has run elections well and has taken creative approaches to voter registration and streamlining of office operations."<ref>{{cite news |title= Keep Ertel, Robinson in office: Our Position: Incumbents have done well with the Seminole School Board and the elections office. |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2006/10/08/keep-ertel-robinson-in-office/ |publisher=Orlando Sentinel|date=October 8, 2006}}</ref> In the end, Ertel defeated Williams by a solid margin, winning 59% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://voteseminole.org/downloads/Election_j8wdff0.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220010831/http://voteseminole.org/downloads/Election_j8wdff0.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-20 }}</ref> In 2008, 2012 and 2016, Ertel was re-elected without opposition. In 2012, when Governor [[Rick Scott]] purged thousands of voters that he claimed to be non-citizens from the voter rolls, Ertel spoke out, noting that since there were so many instances in which the purged voters were actually legally eligible voters, "[T]he list [of purged voters] should have been vetted quite a bit more before they were given to us."<ref>{{cite news|title=Florida elections supervisor: state voting system is flawed|url=http://leanforward.msnbc.com/_news/2012/05/29/11945081-florida-elections-supervisor-state-voting-system-is-flawed?lite|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130616120712/http://leanforward.msnbc.com/_news/2012/05/29/11945081-florida-elections-supervisor-state-voting-system-is-flawed?lite|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 16, 2013|publisher=MSNBC|date=May 29, 2012}}</ref> In 2013, Ertel received the International Electoral Ergonomy Award from the International Centre for Parliamentary Studies for his work as the [[Seminole County, Florida|Seminole County]] Supervisor of Elections; specifically, they praised him for the fact that the Voter Trust Plan he implemented increased voter confidence, increased turnout, and was "exemplary for election management bodies worldwide."<ref>{{cite news |title= Seminole elections supervisor gets international award |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/blogs/political-pulse/os-seminole-elections-supervisor-wins-international-award-20131210,0,5993286.post|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|date=December 10, 2013}}</ref>

=== Secretary of State ===
On December 28, 2018, Ertel was named by [[Governor of Florida|Governor-elect]] [[Ron DeSantis]] to be the next Secretary of State of Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-ne-mike-ertel-secretary-of-state-20181228-story.html|title=Seminole elections supervisor Mike Ertel named Florida's next secretary of state|first=Steven|last=Lemongello|website=OrlandoSentinel.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article223683015.html|title=DeSantis names Seminole County elections chief as Florida secretary of state|website=miamiherald}}</ref> However, when photos of Ertel dressed as a "[[Hurricane Katrina]] victim" in [[blackface]] at a Halloween party in 2005 were leaked by the ''[[Tallahassee Democrat]]'' on the morning of January 24, 2019, he resigned on the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2019/01/24/new-secretary-state-ertel-dressed-blackface-halloween-2005/2649161002/|title=Florida Secretary of State Mike Ertel resigns after Halloween blackface photos emerge|website=Tallahassee Democrat}}</ref>
