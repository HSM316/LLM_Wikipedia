== Education and military service ==
Saul attended day classes in drawing and painting, modelling, and life drawing at [[Glasgow School of Art|The Glasgow School of Art]] from 1912 to 1919.<ref name="auto2"/> During the [[World War I|First World War]], he was required to interrupt his studies to serve in the King's Own Scottish Borderers in 1916/17. Although subject to military conscription, Yaffie reached the rank of corporal during his service.<ref name="auto2"/> Prior to his conscription Yaffie engaged in munitions work, something that was recorded in the GSA's student registers.<ref name="auto2"/>

== Later life ==
The post-war economic depression that affected the country during the 1920s, also affected the Yaffie family directly: Bernard Yaffie's business suffered greatly, and the family eventually emigrated to Canada.<ref name="auto2"/> Saul did not emigrate with his family, choosing instead to stay in Europe, and relocate to [[Paris]] where he continued his artistic practice.<ref name="auto2"/> Now married, Saul sought to escape persecution in Europe by returning to the UK before the [[World War II|Second World War]] with his wife, Estusia. The two settled in Manchester, but returned to France after the war.<ref name="auto2"/>

== Death and legacy ==
Saul Yaffie is listed in the Glasgow School of Art's World War One Roll of Honour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roll of Honour|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=collections/findingaid&id=462&rootcontentid=16306&q=roll+of+honour#id16306|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|access-date=18 September 2015}}</ref> He later went by the name Paul Jeffay, and much of his work is signed under this name.<ref>{{cite web|title=Family History|url=http://www.sjac.org.uk/collections/family-history-genealogy/|website=Scottish Jewish Archives Centre|access-date=18 September 2015}}</ref> Saul Yaffie/Paul Jeffay died in Paris in 1957; his work is included the [[Ben Uri Gallery]]'s Collection of Jewish émigré artists.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Collection: Paul Jeffay|url=http://www.benuri.org.uk/public/?collection-details=1399|website=Ben Uri|publisher=Ben Uri Galleri|access-date=19 September 2015}}</ref>
