'''Kshemendra''' ({{IAST3|Kṣemendra}}; {{circa|990|1070 CE}}) was an 11th-century [[Sanskrit]] poet from [[Kashmir]] in India.

==Biography==
Kshemendra was born into an old, cultured, and affluent family.{{sfn|Haksar|2011|p=xv}} His father was Prakashendra, a descendant of Narendra who was the minister to Jayapida.{{sfn|Warder|1992|p=365}} Both his education and literary output were broad and varied. He studied literature under "the foremost teacher of his time, the celebrated [[Shaiva]] philosopher and literary exponent [[Abhinavagupta]]".{{sfn|Haksar|2011|p=xv}} Kshemendra was born a Shaiva, but later became a Vaishnava.{{sfn|Warder|1992|p=365}} He studied and wrote about both [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Haksar|2011|pp=xv–xvi}} His son, Somendra, provides details about his father in his introduction to the ''Avadana Kalpalata'' and other works. Kshemendra refers to himself in his works as Vyasadasa ({{IAST3|Vyāsadāsa}}; ''Slave of [[Vyasa]]''), a title which was perhaps won or adopted after the completion of his {{IAST|Bhāratamañjari}}.{{sfn|Warder|1992|p=365}}

Kshemendra was in great demand as a skilled abridger of long texts.{{sfn|Warder|1992|p=365}} His literary career extended from at least 1037 (his earliest dated work, ''Brihatkathāmanjari'', a verse summary of the lost ''"Northwestern" Bṛhatkathā''; itself a recension of [[Gunadhya]]'s lost ''[[Bṛhatkathā]]'' — "Great Story") to 1066 (his latest dated work, ''Daśavataracharita'', "an account of the ten incarnations of the god {{IAST|Viṣnu}}").{{sfn|Haksar|2011|pp=xvii–xviii}}

==Extant works==
Around eighteen of Kshemendra's works are still extant while fourteen more are known only through references in other literature.{{sfn|Warder|1992|p=365}} In addition to the genres listed below, he also composed plays, descriptive poems, a satirical novel, a history, and possibly a commentary on the [[Kama Sutra|Kāma Sūtra]].{{sfn|Haksar|2011|pp=xvii, 153-154}}
