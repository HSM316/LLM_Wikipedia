A review from [[AfterEllen]] states "HOLY SHIT THAT WAS AWESOME. After a season of dreary disappointment, the Season 2 finale reminded me why I went from writing a one-off review of this obscure Australian drama to emailing Karman Kregloe to say, "This is the best show I've ever seen and I am doing full recaps." It had twists, action, drama, AND EVEN JOY (what a concept). Now my greatest hope is that ''Wentworth'' can maintain this energy and dynamism for its third season.""<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/tv/223944-wentworth-recap-2-12-teal-is-the-warmest-color|title="Wentworth" recap (2.12): Teal is the Warmest Color|work=AfterEllen|date=6 August 2014|accessdate=18 April 2016}}</ref>
