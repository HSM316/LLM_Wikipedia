'''Cadmium tetrafluoroborate''' is an [[Ionic compound|ionic]], chemical compound with the formula Cd(BF<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.<ref>[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/f?./temp/~9CKeOg:11:FULL Hazardous Substances Database]. toxnet.nlm.nih.gov</ref> It is an ionic, crystalline solid, which is colorless and odorless. Cadmium tetrafluoroborate is most frequently used in the industrial production of [[High-strength low-alloy steel|high-strength steels]], its purpose being to prevent hydrogen [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]], a source of post-production cracking of the metal, in the treated steels. Another application of the chemistry of cadmium tetrafluoroborate is fine tuning of the size of [[cadmium telluride]] [[nanomaterials]].

While the use of cadmium tetrafluoroborate is limited, concerns about limited or chronic exposure to this substance should be brought to the attention of a physician or other trained medical staff. Exposure to cadmium tetrafluoroborate, via ingestion, contact with the skin or mucous membranes, or inhalation can have lasting and harmful health effects.

==Preparation==
Cadmium tetrafluoroborate may be prepared from the reaction between an aqueous solution of [[fluoroboric acid]] and [[cadmium carbonate]] or [[cadmium oxide]]:<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/substance/12886773 |title=Compound Summary for PubChem CID 12886773 |date=2017 |website=NIH }}</ref>

==Structure==

=== Cadmium tetrafluoroborate ===
Cadmium tetrafluoroborate is an ionic compound formed from the two, ionic species Cd<sup>2+</sup> and BF<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>. At room temperature it forms colorless, odorless crystals which are soluble in polar solvents such as water or ethanol. At room temperature, the hydrated salt, Cd(BF<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, exists in a [[monoclinic crystal system]], though this is temperature dependent.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last1=Jain |first1=A.K. |last2=Geoffroy|first2=M.|title=ESR study of phase transitions in single crystals of Cd(BF4)2, 6H2O|journal=Solid State Communications |date=October 1981 |volume=40|issue=1 |pages=33–35 |doi=10.1016/0038-1098(81)90705-5|bibcode=1981SSCom..40...33J }}</ref> Two, first-order [[phase transition]]s have been noted in the literature for this material, one each at 324 K and 177 K, representing a change in the crystal system from monoclinic to [[Hexagonal crystal family|trigonal]] and from trigonal to either monoclinic or [[Triclinic crystal system|triclinic]], respectively.<ref name=":0" /> The quasi-trigonal geometry of the cadmium tetrafluoroborate hexahydrate crystal is unique among the [[Transition metal|first-row transition metal]] tetrafluoroborates and perchlorates, which have predominately [[Hexagonal crystal family|hexagonal]] structures.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Moss |first=K.C.|last2=Russell  |first2=D.R.|last3=Sharp|first3=D.W.A.  |date=1961 |title=The lattice constants of some metal-fluoroborate hexahydrates |journal=Acta Crystallographica |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=330 |doi=10.1107/S0365110X61001133 }}</ref>

=== Related transition-metal complexes ===
The Cd<sup>2+</sup> species of cadmium tetrafluoroborate may associate with various [[ligand]]s to form transition-metal [[Coordination complex|complexes]]. The structural formulas and geometries for such complexes can vary depending upon [[coordination number]] of the complex and the electronic properties of the ligands (see also, [[HSAB theory]]). However, two general forms may predominate: (i) [Cd(L)<sub>n</sub>(BF<sub>4</sub>)<sub>m</sub>], where L and BF<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> are ligands in the inner-sphere, and (ii) [Cd(L)<sub>n</sub>](BF<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, where BF<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> is located in the outer-sphere;<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Chebotarev |first=A.

== Uses ==

=== Electroplating ===
The most significant, industrial use of Cd(BF<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is in the [[electroplating]] of high-strength steels.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book  |title=Electrodeposition: The Materials Science of Coatings and Substrates |last=Dini |first=J.

Khoz. |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=221–3}}</ref> Among other methods of electroplating, cadmium tetrafluoroborate baths have middling efficiency. It has, for instance, been demonstrated that traditional cyanide bathes (e.g. CdCN or ZnCN) and variants there-of provide more efficient distribution of [[current density]] during electroplating, resulting in steels which could bear greater loads.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Geyer |first=N.

== Hazards and Safety ==

=== Biological hazards, safety, and treatment ===
Cadmium tetreafluoroborate is a caustic substance, particularly when in aqueous solution. Multiple routes of exposure, such as ingestion, inhalation, or contact with the skin or [[mucous membrane]]s, are available through contact with aqueous cadmium tetrafluorobromate.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/aldrich/481734?lang=en&region=US |title=Cadmium tetrafluoroborate solution 481734 |website=Sigma-Aldrich |access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{Cite web |url=https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+@rel+14486-19-2. |title=TOXNET |website=toxnet.nlm.nih.gov |access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref> Target biological systems following exposure include the lungs, kidneys, and liver.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7" /> Symptoms of cadmium tetrafluoroborate exposure include nausea, vomiting, fever, irritation of the mucous membranes (e.g. upper respiratory tract, eyes) and skin, coughing, wheezing, or difficulty breathing.<ref name=":6" /> The mechanism of toxicity of this substance is related to [[cadmium poisoning]] and exposure to [[Boronic acid|borates]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]].<ref name=":7" /> The compound functions in solution as a weakly acidic inorganic salt, neutralizing bases.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/8373 |title=CADMIUM FLUOROBORATE {{!}} CAMEO Chemicals {{!}} NOAA |last=GOV |first=NOAA Office of Response and Restoration, US |website=cameochemicals.noaa.gov |access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref> After initial exposure, thorough rising of the affected area with water is recommended. However, seeking medical attention is strongly advised as treatment for exposure to Cd or F containing compounds such as cadmium tetrafluoroborate generally involves [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] administration (I.V.) of calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate for the purpose of maintaining blood pH and sequestering Cd<sup>2+</sup> and BF<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> in [[Solubility|insoluble]] salts.<ref name=":7" />

=== Chronic exposure ===
Chronic exposure to this substance may have negative health consequences. According to its OSHA, IARC, and ACGIH ratings, cadmium tetrafluoroborate is recognized as a carcinogenic substance.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/rn/14486-19-2 |title=ChemIDplus – 14486-19-2 – NXOFSPIMFJTFSE-UHFFFAOYSA-N – Cadmium fluoborate – Similar structures search, synonyms, formulas, resource links, and other chemical information. |last=Chambers |first=Michael |website=chem.nlm.nih.gov |access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/index.php |title=IARC Monographs- Classifications |website=monographs.iarc.fr |access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref> Further effects of chronic exposure may include [[hypocalcaemia]] and [[edema]]s of the respiratory system.<ref name=":6" />

=== Non-biological hazards and safety ===
Although this compound is a negligible fire hazard,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.basstechintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Cadmium-Fluoborate-3-18-14.pdf |title=Material Safety Data Sheet: Cadmium Fluoborate |date=2014 |publisher=BassTech International }}</ref> combustion of cadmium tetrafluoroborate produces hazardous decomposition products including cadmium/[[cadmium oxide]] and [[hydrogen fluoride]]. Therefore, cadmium tetrafluoroborate is stored out of direct light, in a cool environment, and away from other flammable materials.
