This is a [[deciduous]] [[shrub]] growing up to {{convert|2|m}} tall. The oppositely arranged leaves are leathery or papery in texture and measure up to {{cvt|10|cm}} long. Flowers are borne in the leaf axils on [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]s up to {{cvt|2.2|cm}} long. The yellow-green [[sepal]]s are {{cvt|1 or 2|cm}} long and the greenish or reddish petals above are smaller. The [[capsule (fruit)|fruit capsule]] is about {{cvt|1.5|cm}} wide with a red warty or spiny covering. The capsule splits into five sections, revealing seeds covered in bright red [[aril]]s.<ref name=fs/>

The seeds are [[seed dispersal|dispersed]] by animals.<ref name="fs" />  Deer have been known to graze on this plant and seem to love the tender leaves and stems. Humans should take the red color of the seeds as a warning; they are known to be a strong laxative and cause severe diarrhea. In fact, this genus of plants in general is considered poisonous to humans.<ref>{{Cite web|title = December Plant of the Month: Euonymus americanus|url = http://utgardens.tennessee.edu/pom/euonymus.htm|website = utgardens.tennessee.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}</ref>
