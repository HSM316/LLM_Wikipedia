He is hesitant to accept the job, but Tim encourages him to do so, claiming that Kate will have more respect for him. Lee accepts the offer and moves out. However, Tim's actual plan is to convince Kate to offer Lee's room to a new female flatmate, removing her from all male attention. Kate advertises the flat, but her first applicant is an intelligent and attractive man who would be a rival to both Lee and Tim. Tim urges Lee to move back in as quickly as he can. Lee puts off Kate's potential new flatmate by telling him that she likes to do something unpleasant involving fish. He asks Kate to move back in with her, which she does. She tells him that she has heard about Lee's fish story, producing one from behind a cushion and whacking him with it.

Lucy soon decides she wants to buy it herself, and both offer to buy it from Tim. They are visited by a man called Hilary Alison ([[Stewart Francis]]), and both assume he is interested in the flat. Lee pretends it is "a burgled former [[asbestos]] mill" to put him off. Tim decides to sell it to Lee, but he cannot get a mortgage (Hilary was the [[surveyor]]) so Lucy buys it.

However, when confronted, Guy claims it was only his passport. Lee and Tim break into Guy's office and discover several precious stones in the package. Guy admits that it was not a passport he had delivered, and says that the clear stones are white sapphires, which he is going to make into a necklace for Lucy. Still suspicious, Lee steals one and has it valued at [[pound sterling|£]]10,000, and confirms that it is a diamond. The surprise holiday is revealed to be to [[Sicily]]. When Guy and Lucy go to the airport, Barbara warns Lee and Tim that Sicily is famous for gangsters, and that Guy is using Lucy to smuggle the diamonds abroad. Lee and Tim run to the airport and confront Guy, but he explains that the sapphires are real and that the diamond is the only one – and has been made into an engagement ring. Guy asks Lucy to marry him, but Lee asks her to say no – he may not be a gangster, but he is still not right for her. Lee returns to the flat alone, but Lucy later returns, saying she refused Guy as he was too controlling, and their relationship is over.

Lucy finds herself moved to tears when she reads the essay, as she had no idea that he was so sensitive. However, he admits to Tim that he actually downloaded the essay off the internet, and, as the competition was only open to disabled people, he is pretending to be blind. Meanwhile, Tim crashes his car after driving through a red light, and Lee persuades him to pretend the light was green so that he can claim insurance, volunteering himself as a witness. When a journalist turns up to interview Lee, she is expecting to meet a man in a wheelchair, as he accidentally ticked the wrong box. He claims that Tim is his brother, and threatens to pull out of the insurance scam if Tim does not go along with it. The con also involves pretending that Daisy has [[amnesia]]. All goes well until Lucy arrives home, and Lee pretends that she is their sister and has [[Tourette syndrome]]. Lucy is furious but grudgingly goes along with it. However, before Dawn leaves, Lucy insists on playing a game that involves breaking all of Lee's mugs.

 |ShortSummary=Lucy has an important speech to make at a recruitment conference, and when her [[personal assistant|PA]] pulls out, Barbara suggests that Lee offer to write it. Tim also offers to, but Lucy clearly prefers Lee's style and chooses him. However, he is frustrated when Lucy becomes increasingly demanding of him. When Lucy pitches her services to a blackcurrant juice company, Lee invites the representatives to watch her speech. She is furious, and Lee angrily resigns. Tim replaces Lee at writing the speech, but his jokes are not as funny as Lee's. Barbara persuades Lee to ask for his job back, and Lucy grudgingly agrees and asks Lee and Tim to pick up her dress from the dry-cleaners. Lee and Tim accidentally ruin the dress and have to buy Lucy a new one. She likes the new dress, but it is so clingy she has to wear it without underwear. At the speech, Lucy tells all of Lee's jokes wrongly and has to start using those Tim suggested – which surprisingly go down well. However, when she steps out from behind the podium, the bright auditorium lights render her dress see-through, and the audience sees her without her underwear. She still manages to secure the contract with the blackcurrant company.

 |ShortSummary=Lee is horrified when he hears that Lucy is considering marriage to Pavlov (Aleksander Mikic), a political refugee from the old [[Eastern bloc]] who is a local mechanic, just so that he can stay in the country. He initially gets Tim, Geoffrey and Wendy on his side, but, as Lucy's family meet Pavlov and hear his tragic tales of life back home, they are each persuaded that he is a perfect match for Lucy. Lucy and Pavlov plan their wedding, but Lee visits the [[Home Office]] to discover the questions that they will ask when inspecting the couple. When he warns Lucy of the cryptic questions she will be asked, she has second thoughts about the wedding. Lee goes to visit Pavlov himself, and Pavlov realises that the idea is bad and agrees to return to his home country. However, Lee comes up with the idea for Barbara to marry Pavlov instead, and the two drive off for their honeymoon in India.

 |ShortSummary=After an unsuccessful Christmas dinner with her parents, Lucy is cross with Lee's behaviour, and Barbara tells him he should make more of an effort with Lucy. He arranges a special dinner for them, and it seems to go well, until his estranged father Frank ([[Bobby Ball]]) turns up at the flat unannounced, asking to borrow £500. Lee wants him out of the flat but when Frank announces that he is dying, Lucy tells Lee that if he really has changed, he will make an effort to get to know Frank before the inevitable. Lee offers Frank a day out, and after a visit to a lap-dancing club, Frank takes Lee back to the theme park where he once stole Lee a goldfish and later ate it. On a roller-coaster, Frank admits that he is not really dying, and soon after leaves the flat, giving Barbara a more emotional farewell than Lee. Lucy admits that Lee was right all along, and they share a brief kiss under the mistletoe.

 |ShortSummary= When Lucy's first love Scott ([[Simon Farnaby]]) reappears after 19 years and asks her to be in a play that he wrote for her, Lee has to fight for her attention, which ends badly. He believes that Scott is after her and created this play to win her over.

 |ShortSummary= Lucy's nine-year-old [[goddaughter]], Nancy, is suddenly dumped on her by Nancy's mother on the night before the girl's birthday party, after a fire at Nancy's house. Lucy and Lee have to arrange entertainment. Despite disliking Nancy, Lee arranges a [[magic (illusion)|magic]] show for Nancy and her 12 friends. He goes to a magic shop to get what he needs. The magician did not receive the cash which Lee sent Daisy to deliver, so he takes the equipment just before the show. Daisy placed a successful bet with the money, which Lee uses to take Lucy and Nancy to a [[JLS]] concert, where Nancy reveals that she started the fire.

 |ShortSummary=Lee's father wins £400 and he spends it on a boat, which he convinces Lee, Lucy and Daisy to join him on. Lucy is hesitant as she has a fear of water, but Lee eventually persuades her. The boat is a wreck, but Lucy appears to be overcoming her fear, whilst Frank bonds with Daisy and teaches her how to tie knots. The boat floats out to sea. Lee sees Frank deliberately destroying the boat, and the whole adventure is revealed to have been an [[insurance fraud|insurance scam]] - Frank has insured the boat for £4,000 and deliberately let it float away, destroying it and intending to escape - using Lee, Lucy and Daisy as witnesses to the boat's 'accidental' sinking. Daisy accidentally lets the [[dinghy]] float away, leaving the four deserted on a sinking ship. Lucy floats on the one remaining fragment whilst Lee, Frank and Daisy float alongside her, until by chance they find the dinghy and manage to reach safety.

But the Christmas spirit is in short supply when Lucy discovers that the house has not been lived in for years and there appears to be a spooky presence. However, the presence turns out to be Lee's dad Frank, who has also turned up to enjoy Christmas in the house with an old flame (Jane Lowe), and in an effort to get rid of the unwanted visitors he pretends the house is haunted by playing old music and leaving threatening messages on the cellar wall. In the closing part of the episode, it is revealed that the scary snowman that had been built in the garden was unaccounted for, and a ghost of a young boy (Arlo McKillop, real-life son of Lee Mack) was seen to appear in the rocking chair.

Her original choice is a colleague (Timothy Knightley) - but after she worries about not knowing him well enough, she chooses Lee instead. Lee feels uncomfortable about the offer but does not want to upset Lucy, so he agrees on the condition that her parents agree - Lucy eventually persuades them, as well as Frank. Lee turns up at the clinic in a nervous state ready for his donor, but when he puts the porn [[DVD]] on, he keeps imagining faces of people he knows speaking to him as the performer on the video, which puts him under more pressure. He then anxiously gives up and lies to Lucy that he has a problem and is unable to do the donation. Then it leaves Lee and Lucy with no choice but to have intercourse, but Lee ejaculates prematurely. Lucy ultimately accepts that it is not time yet, and she will wait until she is in a relationship.

 |ShortSummary=Lee, Lucy and Daisy are all going abroad together. However, Lee's fear of flying is causing him to overreact to various situations, earning him the disapproval of Olga, the stern air stewardess, before the plane has even taken off. Lee's paranoia gets worse when he notices a passenger who he suspects of being a terrorist due to his nervous disposition and refusal to let go of his bag, even taking it to the toilet with him. When confronting the passenger, Lee notices that he has a box in his bag labelled 'Cartridges' and reports this to Olga, who investigates and reports back. Later, when Lee is trying to steal a drink from the fridge, he overhears the passenger having a private conversation with Olga about a secret plan and reflecting on the fact that they managed to shake off Lee's suspicions. Lee spots a gun in the passenger's bag, but accidentally alerts the pair to his presence and has to return to his seat. He alerts Lucy and Daisy to the fact that Olga appears to be in on the terrorist threat together, and they hatch a plan for Lee to steal the man's bag whilst Lucy and Daisy distract him. The bag in hand, Lee runs to the cockpit to warn the captain but only succeeds in appearing to be a terrorist himself. When the suspicious passenger comes to confront him, Lee attempts to reveal the gun, only to pull a banana out of the bag instead. The passenger draws the real gun and appears about to shoot Lee before it is revealed that he is, in fact, a member of the Secret Service who is on board the plane in response to the terror threats, and it is Lee who has come across as a terrorist. With everything cleared up, the Air Marshal punches Lee in anger. The episode ends with Lee and Lucy returning to the flat, Lucy and Daisy having spent the whole holiday being looked after by the British ambassador whilst Lee was in custody.

After she leaves for the interview, Toby tells Lee that Lucy is actually meeting his cousin Carl, whom she has been getting serious with on social media for several months. He speculates why Lucy may not have told Lee about Carl, causing Lee to affirm his feelings toward her. Toby offers to text Carl and ask him to back off (admitting that Carl suspects that there is someone else on the scene and has asked him to find out for him) but only agrees to dissuade Carl if Lee actually intends to act on his feelings. Lee appears ready, but gets cold feet at the idea of marriage and kids, eventually telling Toby to tell Carl to go ahead with his plan to invite Lucy to Naples. Lucy returns, saying that the restaurant is very interested in her and have invited her to Naples to finalise the deal. On the spur of the moment, Lee admits to Lucy that he is in love with her and asks her to marry him, and a delighted Lucy accepts. However, when the restaurant's female manager arrives to return a contract Lucy had left behind, Toby admits that it had always been a business meeting and that he had made Carl up in order to give Lee an incentive to act on his feelings for Lucy, which had been obvious to everyone for ages.

 |ShortSummary=Anna brings Charlie back to Lucy and Lee's house, having taken him to a party. Charlie is delighted with his prize for having won the party's ugly face competition. When it goes missing, Lee and Lucy think that Toby and Anna's son Jack stole it, and go to their house to accuse him. Jack says that he did not steal it, and his parents support him. Lee goes into Jack's bedroom and takes an identical key ring from there. Anna calls at Lee and Lucy's house, where she tells Lucy that she bought an identical key ring for Jack, that it is now missing, and that she thinks that Lee stole it. After Anna leaves, Lee admits to Lucy that he did steal it, assuming it was Charlie's. Lee and Lucy sneak into Toby and Anna's house using their spare key whilst the house is empty and plant the key ring in their bedroom. Toby and Anna come home early from their date, so Lee and Lucy hide under the bed. Toby and Anna have sex. Toby and Anna look under the bed and see Lee and Lucy there. Back home, Lee notices that he accidentally brought Anna's knickers home.

 |ShortSummary= To teach the children to be more responsible, Lee and Lucy get a family pet. They decide to pick up a rabbit from a rescue centre, but soon after the family arrive, the kids change their minds and choose a [[hairless rat]] instead. After they do not look after it properly, Lee takes it back. He changes his mind and tries to retrieve it, but is turned away. He falsely claims that it died, and the family have a funeral in their back garden for it, burying a cardboard box containing [[golf ball]]s in a sock. Toby, unaware of Lee's lie, arrives in the garden to give Lee the rat, which he picked up from the centre in a cardboard box. Lee says that he does not want it, then Lucy opens the box, revealing that the box is empty and has a hole a few inches long in a corner. The rat climbs out of the grave in front of the family. Lee tells the kids that he mistakenly thought the rat had died when it was asleep.

 |ShortSummary= Lee and Lucy cancel their planned dinner with Toby and Anna at Toby and Anna's house on the day so that they can watch [[Television in Norway|Norwegian]] crime series The [[Oslo]] Murders on [[Netflix]]. They falsely claim to Toby and Anna that they had to stay home with their daughter Molly because she is ill. Toby and Anna come round, with Toby (a doctor) suggesting that he examine her. Molly comes downstairs and is clearly not ill, revealing Lee and Lucy to be lying. Lee and Lucy then pretend that the real reason that they cancelled is that they had a row about Lee having revealed to Lucy the identity of the killer in The Oslo Murders. Lee then tells various lies about suspected affairs of Lucy and Anna, after which Toby and Anna said that they knew all along that Lee and Lucy were lying, and pushed them into telling a string of lies as revenge on them for cancelling dinner.

 |ShortSummary    = Toby has pressured Lee, Lucy, Anna, Frank, Geoffrey and Wendy into taking part in a sponsored [[skydive]] with him to raise money for their local children's hospital, despite most of them being terrified at the prospect. However, when they discover just before the jump that one [[parachute]] has gone missing, they each try to make a convincing case for why they should or should not take part. The power struggle escalates when Lee revealed he did it all on purpose. Wendy, Toby, Anna and Lucy jump individually. The pilot says that the plane is going to crash. Frank jumps, and Geoffrey lets Lee use the remaining parachute. The pilot and instructor reveal to Geoffrey that there was no problem with the plane and that it was a ploy to make them jump from it. Geoffrey is pleased that he will seem heroic and will not need to jump. The pilot gives Geoffrey his parachute.
