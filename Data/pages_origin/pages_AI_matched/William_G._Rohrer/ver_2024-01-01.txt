In the 1980s his businesses suffered financial losses and his political popularity waned.<ref name="Hepp"/>

== Business Career ==
His first jobs were working in his father's grocery store and at the small car dealership his father started in [[Pottsville, Pennsylvania]], in the late 1920s.   In 1929 Roher's father moved the car dealership, the Rohrer Chevrolet Agency, to [[Camden, New Jersey]], to take advantage of an economic boom in South Jersey.  He became owner of the dealership after his father's death in 1935, making his fortune by growing it into one of the largest in the nation by 1947.<ref name="Hepp"/>

In 1955, Rohrer bought a small bank in South Jersey that held $2.9 million in deposits.  He renamed it First Peoples Bank and under his ownership, it became one of the largest in the area.  By 1970 it had more than $100 million in deposits; by the early 1980s, it had become the first billion-dollar bank in South Jersey.<ref name="Hepp"/>

== Political career ==
Rohrer served as a township committeeman from 1947 to 1951, and as [[Mayor of Haddon Township, New Jersey]], from 1951 to 1987. He was a commissioner on the Delaware River Port Authority. He was also a member of the [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden County]] Ethics Committee.<ref>{{cite news|author=Barbara S.

Wallace]] retired.  In a close race, Cowgill defeated Rohrer by 290 votes, 54,683 (50.02%) to 54,393 (49.76%).<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Campaigns|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=744345|publisher=Ourcampaigns.com|access-date=7 December 2014}}</ref>  Rohrer again faced Cowgill when he sought re-election in 1959; this time, Cowgill won by 4,092 votes, 61,656 (51.72%) to 57,564 (48.28%).<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Campaigns|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=744310|publisher=Ourcampaigns.com|access-date=7 December 2014}}</ref>
