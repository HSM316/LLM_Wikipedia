At [[Virginia Military Institute]], he established himself immediately as a fine all-around cadet leader and athlete.  He lettered in four sports: football, basketball, baseball, and track. He was the first VMI cadet to win letters in all of these sports, and ended up with twelve letters in three years.<ref name="VSHFM">[http://vshfm.com/inductees/inductee_details.php?inducteeID=247 Francis Summers – VSHFM Class of 1975]</ref> In football, Summers was named to the All-[[South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association|South Atlantic]] team and played a key role as left tackle and defensive line on the [[1920 VMI Keydets football team|1920 squad]] (nicknamed the "Flying Squadron") that was the first and only undefeated and tie-free VMI football team.<ref name="Cadet2">{{cite news|date=December 15, 1947|title=Original Flying Squadron Members Lead Varied Lives|url=http://www2.vmi.edu/thecadet/pdfs-hi/1947/The-Cadet_1947-12-15.pdf|newspaper=[[The Cadet (newspaper)|The Cadet]]|location=[[Lexington, VA]]|publisher=Virginia Military Institute|access-date=July 10, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714200437/http://www2.vmi.edu/thecadet/pdfs-hi/1947/The-Cadet_1947-12-15.pdf|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He was captain of the track team where he specialized in the [[shot put]] and [[discus throw]].<ref name="Cadet">{{cite news|date=March 30, 1936|title=Summers Will Coach R.-M.
