'''Muhammad Mustafa Hussain''' is an electronics engineer specializing in CMOS technology-enabled low-cost flexible, stretchable and reconfigurable electronic systems. He was a professor in [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology]] and [[University of California, Berkeley]], and is a currently an electrical and computer engineering professor at [[Purdue University]]. He is the [[principal investigator]] (PI) at Integrated Nanotechnology Laboratory,<ref>{{cite web|title=Integrated Nanotechnology Laboratory|url=https://nanotechnology.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/hussain.aspx|language=en-us}}</ref> and Integrated Disruptive Electronic Applications (IDEA) Laboratory.<ref>{{cite web|title=IDEA Lab|url=http://mmhlabs.org/}}</ref> He is also the director of the Virtual Fab: vFabLab™ (https://vFabLab.org).

== Education and career ==
Born and brought up in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Hussain obtained his [[bachelor's degree]] in electrical and electronics engineering from the [[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology]], in 2000. He completed his master's from [[University of Southern California]] in 2002 and joined [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he completed another M.S. and doctoral degrees (December 2005). In 2006, he joined [[Texas Instruments]] as an integration engineer to lead the [[22 nanometer|22 nm node]], non-planar, [[Multigate device|MugFET]] technology development. In 2008, he joined [[SEMATECH]] as the program manager of Novel Emerging Technology Program, where he oversaw CMOS technology development in Austin, Texas, and in Albany, New York. His program was supported by [[DARPA|United States Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA)]].  He joined the [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology]] (KAUST) as a founding faculty in August 2009.{{fact|date=July 2024}}
