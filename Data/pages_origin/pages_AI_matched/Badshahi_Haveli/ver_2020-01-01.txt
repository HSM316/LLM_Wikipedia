Located in Naya Bazar, Ajmer, '''Badshahi Haveli''' was built in 1507 on the order of Emperor Akbar. Rectangular in shape, the building has a pillared hall inside. The Haveli has rooms on all the four corners and can be entered via the eastern verendah. The Haveli was used by one of the Amirs of Akbar as a residence later. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asijaipurcircle.nic.in/Badshahi%20haveli,%20Ajmer.html#|title=BADSHAHI HAVELI {{!}} ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF INDIA JAIPUR CIRCLE|website=asijaipurcircle.nic.in|access-date=2019-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.patrika.com/ajmer-news/overlook-at-heritage-lock-310845/|title=धरोहर पर अनदेखी का ताला|website=www.patrika.com|language=hindi|access-date=2019-09-21}}</ref>
