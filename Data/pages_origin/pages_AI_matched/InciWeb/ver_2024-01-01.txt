'''InciWeb''' is an interagency all-[[risk]] incident web information management system provided by the [[United States Forest Service]] released in 2004.<ref>[http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/http%3A%2F%2Finciweb.nwcg.gov] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305055438/http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/http:%2F%2Finciweb.nwcg.gov |date=2016-03-05 }}. [[Alexa Internet]].</ref>  It was originally developed for [[wildfire|wildland fire]] emergencies, but can be also used for other [[emergency]] incidents ([[natural disaster]]s, such as [[earthquake]]s, [[flood]]s, [[hurricane]]s, and [[tornado]]es).<ref>[http://gacc.nifc.gov/admin/about_us/about_us.htm About Us], [[National Interagency Fire Center|National Geographic Area Coordination Center]]s (GACC).</ref>

==Introduction==
[[Image:2015 Cajon Pass wildfire (North Fire).jpeg|300px|thumb|right| InciWeb photo of the 2015 [[North Fire]] in California]]
It was developed with two primary missions:

* 1. Provide the public a single source of incident related information 
* 2. Provide a standardized reporting tool for the [[Public relations|Public Affairs]] community<ref>[https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/about/ About this Site]. InciWeb. Retrieved 2009-08-30.</ref>

Official announcements include evacuations, road closures, news releases, maps, photographs, and basic info and current situation about the incident.

Incident information can be accessed by:
* web browser at https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/
* [[Twitter]]<ref>[https://twitter.com/inciweb inciweb on Twitter]</ref>
* [[RSS]] web feed

==Technical ==
The original [[Application software|application]] was hosted at the [[United States Forest Service]] - Wildland Fire Training and Conference Center, at [[McClellan Airfield]], [[California]], comprising three [[Server (computing)|server]]s:
*[[Database server]]
*[[Application server|Administrative server]]
*[[Load balancing (computing)|Load balancer]] for the public content which routes traffic to a pool of eight servers.

[[Web traffic]] averages 2 million plus [[Hit (internet)|hits]] daily during the fire season with the ability to handle 3.5 million hits.

The servers were moved to the National information Technology Center (NITC),<ref>[http://www.ocio.usda.gov/nitc/index.html Enterprise IT Solutions: About NITC]. Office of the Chief Information Officer, [[United States Department of Agriculture]].</ref> [[Kansas City, Missouri]] on July 16, 2008, along with the release of version 2.0;<ref>[http://www.myfirecommunity.net/Neighborhood.aspx?ID=385 Public home page for InciWeb] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916064304/http://www.myfirecommunity.net/Neighborhood.aspx?ID=385 |date=2009-09-16 }}.
