==History==
[[File:Marketing_Summit_2012_in_Dhaka,_Bangladesh.jpg|alt=World Marketing Summit 2012 in Dhaka, Bangladesh|thumb|World Marketing Summit 2012 in Dhaka, Bangladesh]]
World Marketing Summit was founded in 2011 by Philip Kotler, an American marketing professor, author and consultant; currently the S. C. Johnson Distinguished Professor of International Marketing at the [[Kellogg School of Management]] at Northwestern University.

Kotler attended a seminar in Abu Dhabi in which he first shared the idea of forming a forum of marketers who can contribute towards alleviating poverty. Later, this idea was shared with other associates in Canada and Bangladesh and finally evolved into a tangible concept. The concept gave birth to World Marketing Summit in 2012 in Dhaka, Bangladesh under the patronage of the Government of Bangladesh in collaboration with Bangladesh Brand Forum.

===Journal: Better World===
''Better World'' is the biannual journal of WMS (January and July) for business managers, academicians and researchers working in the areas of marketing and economics for alleviating poverty. WMS encourages articles covering diverse areas, industries, geographic locations and cultures which specifically focus on such areas as research, strategy, communication, pricing, distribution, sales, and leadership. Articles should be based on research analysis, theoretical insights, and practical experience so that the ideas presented there can be implemented.

===Research===
With a view to initiate global movements through marketing strategies, WMS has undertaken the Incubator concept of carrying out research on health, food, climate change and education in different countries and developing a marketing model in line with [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs). The main objective of the incubator approach is to formulate a conceptual framework driven by marketing principles and implement the findings in a real world scenario. Each incubator will have a mix of partners that will contribute both a theoretical point of view as well as a practical point of view. 
The research wing of WMS actively collaborates with world’s leading experts{{who|date=April 2024}} from universities, business chambers, think tanks and other research-based organizations help developing business and academic model.{{cn|date=April 2024}}
