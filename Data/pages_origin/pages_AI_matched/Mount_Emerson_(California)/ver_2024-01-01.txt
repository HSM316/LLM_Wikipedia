== History ==
Mount Emerson is named in honor of the essayist, poet and philosopher [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. [[John Muir]] wrote in a letter to Mrs. Ezra S. Carr that "I have named a grand wide-winged mountain on the head of the Joaquin Mount Emerson. Its head is high above its fellows and wings are white with ice and snow."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vault.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/life/life_and_letters/chapter_10.aspx |title=The Life and Letters of John Muir |first=William Frederic |last=Bad√® |publisher=Sierra Club |accessdate=December 1, 2014}}</ref> It has been suggested that Muir might have intended to confer the poet's name on [[Mount Humphreys]] which had already been named by the [[California Geological Survey|Whitney Survey]].<ref name=browning>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Browning |title=Place Names of the Sierra Nevada |page=65 |isbn=089997-047-8}}</ref>
