{{Short description|Clitoral erection during or after sleep}}
'''Nocturnal clitoral tumescence''' ('''NCT'''), colloquially known as '''morning bean''',<ref>{{cite web |title=What happens 'down below' while you sleep |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/what-happens-down-below-while-you-sleep/ZSBEA6Q7FZ65TKKKLURBYDW2IM/ |website=NZ Herald |date=June 23, 2018}}</ref> is a spontaneous [[Clitoral erection|swelling of the clitoris]] during sleep or when waking up. Similar to the process in males, [[nocturnal penile tumescence]], females experience clitoris tumescence and engorgement of the vagina, mainly during the [[REM sleep]] phase.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uiZsAAAAMAAJ&q=nocturnal+clitoral+tumescence |title=Psychiatry|volume=1|author=Robert Michels|editor=Robert Michels|publisher=Lippincott |year=1985|isbn=9780397506866 |access-date=2013-10-14|page=139}}</ref>

According to Fisher et al., the increase in vaginal blood flow associated with NCT during REM sleep is similar to the process in men in frequency, i.e. 95% of REM phases. It does occur a bit more often in non-REM sleep, and each episode appears shorter in duration. In terms of size, NCT is similar to that induced by erotic stimulation when awake. The erection may be associated with erotic dreams and even, occasionally, [[Nocturnal emission|sleep orgasms]].<ref name=Fisher>{{cite journal |last1=Fisher |first1=C. |last2=Cohen |first2=H.

The study did not measure specific sleep phases. Increases in vaginal pH are associated with sexual arousal and clitoral erection. [[Bartholin's glands]] secrete alkaline fluid to lubricate the vagina during arousal, increasing vaginal pH.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gören |first1=Mehmet Reşit |last2=Özer |first2=Cevahir |last3=Oğuzülgen |first3=İbrahim |title=Nocturnal Vaginal pH Monitoring: A Possible New Assessment Method for Female Sexual Function |journal=Journal of Urological Surgery |date=2023 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=213–219 |doi=10.4274/jus.galenos.2023.2022.0051|doi-access=free }}</ref>
