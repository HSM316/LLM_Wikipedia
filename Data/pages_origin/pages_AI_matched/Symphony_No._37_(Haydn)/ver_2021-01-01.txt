{{About|the symphony by [[Joseph Haydn]]|the symphony by [[Michael Haydn]]|Symphony No. 37 (Michael Haydn)}}
The '''Symphony No. 37 in [[C major]]''', [[Hoboken-Verzeichnis|Hob.]] I/37, is a [[symphony]] by [[Joseph Haydn|Franz Joseph Haydn]]. The numbering is completely misleading, as it is clearly one of Haydn's earliest symphonies.  A copy of the score found at [[Český Krumlov]], Czech Republic, is dated 1758.  It can be presumed it was written for the orchestra of [[Count Morzin]], in which Haydn was employed until<ref name="apbrown4243">Brown, A. Peter, ''The Symphonic Repertoire'' (Volume 2).  Indiana University Press ({{ISBN|025333487X}}), pp. 42–43 (2002).</ref> February 1761.

This symphony is a candidate for the first one he ever had written, if his [[Symphony No. 1 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 1]] was not indeed his first symphony.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Playing Before the LORD - The Life o Joseph Haydn|last=Stapert|first=Calvin R.|publisher=William B.

The work is scored for two [[oboe]]s, [[bassoon]], two [[Natural horn|horn]]s, [[trumpet]]s, [[timpani]] and [[String section|strings]] with [[Basso continuo|continuo]].<ref>[[H. C. Robbins Landon]], ''The Symphonies of Joseph Haydn''. London: Universal Edition & Rockliff (1955): 671. "2 ob., 2 cor. (prob. in C ''alto'') and/or 2 clarini (trpt.), timp., str. [fag., cemb.]."</ref> It is possible the trumpet and timpani parts were added later.<ref>Hodgson (1976): 59. "The trumpet and timpani parts were almost certainly added later."</ref>

The work is in four movements:

#[[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Presto]] ([[C major]], 168 bars,<ref  name="tgkohn1484">https://imslp.org/wiki/Symphony_No.37_in_C_major,_Hob.I:37_(Haydn,_Joseph)</ref> {{music|time|2|4}})
#[[Minuet|Menuet]] e Trio (C major and [[C minor]] (Trio), 24 bars and 26 bars (Trio),<ref name="tgkohn1484"/> {{music|time|3|4}}
#[[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Andante]], C minor, 71 bars,<ref name="tgkohn1484"/> {{music|time|2|4}}
#Presto, C major, 82 bars,<ref name="tgkohn1484"/> {{music|time|3|8}}

The key organization limited to C major and C minor in the four movements indicates perhaps a reliance on the Baroque suites as a guide for tonal organization of the movements, the influence of the first three symphonies by [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach |C.P.E. Bach]],<ref>Whose Symphony in D major, H.651 of 1755 uses D major for each of its three movements. See https://imslp.org/wiki/Symphony_in_D_major%2C_H.651_(Bach%2C_Carl_Philipp_Emanuel).</ref><ref>His Symphony in E minor, H.653 of 1756 has movements in E minor, G major, and E minor. See https://imslp.org/wiki/Symphony_in_E_minor%2C_H.653_(Bach%2C_Carl_Philipp_Emanuel),</ref><ref>The C.P.E. Bach Symphony in G major, H.648 of 1741 has movements in G major, G minor, and G major. See https://imslp.org/wiki/Symphony_in_G_major%2C_H.648_(Bach%2C_Carl_Philipp_Emanuel).</ref> or an early simplicity of tonal language.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} (Haydn was in his mid-20s at the composition of this symphony.)

===First Movement===
Similarities have been drawn between the {{music|time|2|4}} opening movement and the {{music|time|2|4}} finale to [[Georg von Reutter]]'s ''Servizio di tavola'' in C major from 1757.<ref name="apbrown4243"/>  The two knew each other because Reutter was the director of music in [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] where Haydn sang as a child.

===Second Movement===
The work is one of the few symphonies of the Classical era to place the Minuet second (others include Haydn's [[Symphony No. 32 (Haydn)|32nd]] and [[Symphony No. 44 (Haydn)|44th]], and his brother [[Michael Haydn|Michael's]] [[Symphony No. 15 (Michael Haydn)|15th]] and [[Symphony No. 16 (Michael Haydn)|16th]]). The [[International Music Score Library Project|IMSLP]] reverses the order of the Menuet e Trio and the Andante, thus bringing the movement order to the standard that was eventually established as [[common practice]].<ref name="tgkohn1484"/>

===Third Movement===
The slow movement is very similar to the slow movement in one of Haydn's earliest piano sonatas, Hob. XVI:Es2.<ref name="apbrown4243"/>
