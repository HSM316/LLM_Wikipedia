''' Recapturetheglory''' (foaled February 11, 2005) is an [[United States|American]] [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorse]].

Recapturetheglory is a bay horse bred by Charles Jacobi. He was sired by the [[Breeders' Cup Sprint]] winner [[Cherokee Run]] is out of the mare Cold Awakening, by [[Dehere]].

Recapturetheglory is owned by [[Louisiana]]ns [[Louie Roussel III]] and Ronald Lamarque, who also owned [[Risen Star]], winner of the 1988 [[Preakness Stakes]] and [[Belmont Stakes]]. Conditioned for racing by Roussel, at age two the colt won for the first time in his third start in a September 29, 2007 maiden special weight race on at [[Hawthorne Race Course]].

In his second start of 2008, Recapturetheglory was sent off as a 15-1 longshot in the 2008 [[Illinois Derby]] at Hawthorne Race Course. Under jockey [[E. T. Baird]], the colt scored a convincing four-length victory and his winning purse means he qualified for the [[Kentucky Derby]], the first leg of [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United States Triple Crowns|U.S. Triple Crown]] series. He finished 5th in the 2008 [[Kentucky Derby]].

In 2011, at the age of 6, Recapturetheglory took the $100,000 [[Louisiana Handicap]].
