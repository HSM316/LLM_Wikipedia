===Issues===

====Capital punishment====
Washburne spent the 2015 legislative session pushing for more severe capital punishments for specific aggravators as chair of the House Courts and Criminal Code Committee. Senate Bill 385,<ref name=bill>{{cite web|title=Senate Bill No. 385|url=https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2015/bills/senate/385/#document-721e3a1e|website=Indiana General Assembly|accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref> which passed the Senate and has moved on to the House, would allow for defendants to receive the death penalty or a conviction of life without parole if they are charged of committing murder on a school grounds or in a place of religious worship. Washburne, who is a strong supporter of capital punishment, says that both of those situations warrant being added to the list of aggravators, which already includes defendants charged with dismembering a body.<ref name=indystarMar2015>{{cite news|last1=Guerra|first1=Kristine|title=Bill allowing death penalty in school shootings has good chance in House committee|url=http://www.jconline.com/story/news/2015/03/10/bill-allowing-death-penalty-school-shootings-good-chance-house-committee/24735153/|accessdate=9 April 2015|agency=Indianapolis Star|date=March 10, 2015}}</ref><ref name=WBIW>{{cite news|title=House Committee Approves One Expansion Of Death Penalty|url=http://www.wbiw.com/state/archive/2015/04/house-committee-approved-one-expansion-of-death-penalty.php|accessdate=9 April 2015|agency=WBIW|date=April 3, 2015}}</ref>

====Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 2015====
Washburne also voted for Indiana's version of the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]], which was signed into law by Indiana Gov. [[Mike Pence]] on April 2, 2015.<ref name=indystarApr2015>{{cite news|last1=Cook|first1=Tony|title=Gov.

Washburne says it's important that citizens of Indiana have religious freedoms, even those that others "might be appalled by."<ref name=aletia>{{cite news|last1=STRICHERZ|first1=MARK|title=Gay Couples Couldn't Demand Business Services Under Indiana Bill|url=http://www.aleteia.org/en/religion/article/gay-couples-couldnt-demand-business-services-under-indiana-bill-5823620853006336|accessdate=9 April 2015|agency=aletia|date=March 27, 2015}}</ref>
