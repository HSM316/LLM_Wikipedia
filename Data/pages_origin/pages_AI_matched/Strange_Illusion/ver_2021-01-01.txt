==Reception==

===Critical response===
Film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review, yet liked the atmospherics of the film, and wrote, "The dark psychological thriller had an engrossing premise courtesy of [[William Shakespeare|Mr. Shakespeare]] and was influenced further by [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] dream analysis, but it was unconvincing as a melodrama, the script was weak, the plot was full of holes and the acting was as lame as it gets...What's interesting is that the film is shot as an intense dream sequence in shadowy black-and-white hues and its sense of delirium powerfully filters through the story almost wiping away the unconvincing heavy-handed performances of the villains and the mummified acting by the leads. It's a film where Ulmer's unique style and his film noir moody interjections work better than the derivative mystery story."<ref>[http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/strangeillusion.htm Schwartz, Dennis]. ''"Ozus' World Movie Reviews,"'' film review, September 20, 2004.  Accessed: August 1, 2013.</ref>

Critic Matthew Sorrento of ''Film Threat'' also lauded the film: "Though saddled with the script’s fetish for Freud, Ulmer stylizes his thriller without sending it adrift. Like his other great films, ''Strange Illusion'' is a shaggy quickie that takes fine shape throughout."<ref>[http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/30783/ Sorrento, Matthew]. ''Film Threat'', film review, February 18, 2011. Accessed: August 1, 2013.</ref>
