{{nihongo|'''Noctis Lucis Caelum'''|ノクティス・ルシス・チェラム|Nokutisu Rushisu Cheramu}}, {{nihongo|"Noct"|ノクト|Nokuto}} for short, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from [[Square Enix]]'s ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. He is a playable character and [[main protagonist]] of ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', originally a spin-off titled ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII''. The crown prince and protector of Lucis, Noctis and his allies must reclaim their country when the empire of Niflheim attacks Lucis in an attempt to take control of its magical Crystal. Alongside ''Final Fantasy XV'', Noctis has appeared in the game's expanded media, including ''Final Fantasy'' [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] titles, and other game titles including ''[[Puzzle & Dragons]]'' and the fighting game ''[[Tekken 7]]''.

Noctis was created and co-designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], with later design revisions being handled by [[Yusuke Naora]]. Nomura created Noctis as a type of protagonist not featured in a leading role in the ''Final Fantasy'' series before. He also wanted his personality to be unique in the series, being unlike protagonists like [[Cloud Strife]] or [[Squall Leonhart]], instead focusing more on realism. Noctis' clothes were designed by Hiromu Takahara, lead designer for Japanese fashion house Roen. His clothing was created to be both asymmetric, mirroring the fashion house's trademark style, and indicative of the game's themes and atmosphere. Before his design was finalized, Noctis was given a story-inspired temporary outfit used in early trailers.

Since his original reveal, Noctis has been compared with other asocial characters seen in the series' other games based on his appearance. Following the release of the game, Noctis has been positively received by journalists, with many noting his growth over the course of the story, and contrasting him against other ''Final Fantasy'' protagonists. His appearances in both the expanded media of ''Final Fantasy XV'' and other games have gathered multiple types of responses.

==Character design==
[[File:FF Versus XIII first trailer screenshot.png|left|thumb|Noctis as he appears in the first trailer for ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII'', showing his placeholder design.]]
Noctis was created and designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], the original director of ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''. ''XV''  was originally titled ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII'', planned as a series [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] within the ''[[Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy|Fabula Nova Crystallis]]'' subseries and companion to ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''.<ref name= "XVsummary1"/><ref name="QJnotes"/> Nomura did not want Noctis to look strong, instead being used more to communicate the darkness in the story, which caused some difficulties for the team.<ref name="QJnotes"/> His full name loosely translates from [[Latin]] into "Light of [the] Night Sky";<ref name= "IGNnoctis"/><ref name= "FinalandNomura"/> his nickname, ''Noct'', translates as "of the Night".<ref name= "KotakuNoct"/> Noctis's name was not going to be based on the sky or weather, as with previous protagonists designed by Nomura. After [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]], the main protagonist of ''Final Fantasy XIII'', was given a weather-based name, Nomura gave Noctis his current name.<ref name="Famitsu1001"/> This name was also a reference to [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], the main protagonist of the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series; ''Sora'' and ''Caelum'' both mean "sky" in their respective languages, and Nomura considered Noctis to be his latest "son".<ref name= "FinalandNomura"/> Noctis' adult appearance was designed by art co-director [[Yusuke Naora]].<ref name="JPNoctAdult"/><ref name="IGNcharacterBehind"/>

A major departure from Noctis' character in contrast to previous Japanese role-playing games' protagonists was his ageing across ''Final Fantasy XV''. Despite fears of how it would be received by fans, the Square Enix staff decided to make this change. Tabata further elaborated that it "felt that it was important in communicating [the party's] development and wanting to express it in a way that we only can with the current generation of consoles."<ref name="IGNtenyears"/> When creating the development of Noctis' facial features over time, the team drew from pictures of war veterans and actors to add finer details to help mature the character's expression. They also designed Noctis' features so they would hold similarities to Regis, reflecting the game's theme of the father-son relationship.<ref name="XVguideCollect2"/>

While the game changed names, platforms and eventually directors, Nomura worked with new director [[Hajime Tabata]] to ensure that Noctis remained as unchanged as possible in the final product.<ref name= "GemTabataInterviews"/> Alterations and adjustments made to his character model were supervised by Naora. The main goal was to make Noctis appear more realistic: his skin texture was enhanced and subtleties added to its depiction and the effect of different lighting on it, in addition to adding elements such as subtle birthmarks and skin blotches. One of the major goals was keeping the same character impression while making adjustments and enhancements, as series fans already had a concept of who the character was. His hair's shadow effects needed to be adjusted after the upgrade in technology so they did not cast too much shade on his face, but the hairstyle itself was kept consistent.<ref name="IGNcharacterBehind"/> His hairstyle was meant to give two impressions to the player: from the front it was ordered, while from the rear it looked wild.<ref name="Famitsu1001"/> In order to make his hair movements realistic, the team worked with a professional hairstylist to create the design using a mannequin's wig, then used the [[Luminous Engine]] to render it in real-time. The technique was originally used for the characters in the engine's 2012 tech demo ''[[Luminous Engine#Agni's Philosophy|Agni's Philosophy]]''.<ref name= "NoctisHair"/>

The character's clothing was designed by Hiromu Takahara, the main designer at Japanese fashion house Roen.<ref name= "FamRoen1"/> Takahara's key inspiration for the style and coloring of the clothing was "jet black", which was meant to exemplify and be representative of the game's atmosphere. In addition, Takahara designed the outfit along the same lines as the [[Asymmetry|asymmetric]] designs common to Roen's clothing lines.<ref name= "GemClothing"/> His outfit was designed to make Noctis look like someone who went to a high-class pub.<ref name="FamRoen2"/> Unlike previous ''Final Fantasy'' protagonists, a real set of Noctis' clothes was created by Roen and kept in the office for reference by the development staff: this was due to previous experiences when Nomura had been constantly asked what materials his characters' outfits were made of by the graphics teams.<ref name= "FinalandNomura"/> An aspect of his design central to the story was a ring he wore on his right hand, while the gloves he wore were simply for "design purposes".<ref name= "GemClothing"/> Noctis's outfit when the game was first revealed was a temporary one used while his final look was being created.<ref name="Famitsu1001"/> It was based on the game's script to give a visual impression in trailers.<ref name="FamRoen2"/> Takahara also designed a formal suit worn by the character in the original opening section of the game.<ref name= "FamRoen3"/> All Roen designs, including Noctis' suit, were retained when ''Versus XIII'' was rebranded as ''Final Fantasy XV'' as the team felt wrong about removing them despite the other changes.<ref name="NovCrysInterview"/>

==Attributes==
While originally one of four controllable characters in ''Versus XIII'', Noctis is the sole playable character in ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name="Andriasang Nomura"/><ref name= "GemTabataGameplay"/> He is also the only character who can use [[Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Summoning|summoned monsters]], recurring elements in the ''Final Fantasy'' series.<ref name= "PolySummons"/> Noctis has the power to manipulate multiple weapons at once; his Limit Break "Armiger" further enables him to summon crystalline weapons known as "Royal Arms" into battle.<ref name= "GemTabataGameplay"/><ref name= "XVDuscaeDemo"/> In the story, these powers are passed down through the royal line of Lucis.<ref name= "GemClothing"/> During an earlier stage of development, Noctis was the only character in the world of ''XV'' that could use magic. As this would not have worked from a gameplay standpoint, the team engineered it so Noctis' companions could share Noctis' magic abilities.<ref name= "KotakuJump"/> During certain points during both story scenes and gameplay, Noctis' eyes turn from their natural blue color to red. This feature was present in both ''Versus XIII'' and ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name= "GemClothing"/><ref name="FamitsuRed"/>

===Personality===
Nomura did not want Noctis to have a personality like [[Squall Leonhart]] or [[Cloud Strife]], the respective protagonists of ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VII|VII]]'', defining their personality type as that of "a silent, gloomy little boy". Instead, Nomura wanted to create a realistic character type not seen in the ''Final Fantasy'' series before. Because of this, he was wary about him as he was so new to the series that he might fall "out of bounds". Whereas previous protagonists did not have strong personalities to avoid interfering with player empathy, Nomura wanted Noctis to have "an overabundance of [[idiosyncrasy]]", which was one of the ways he would leave an impression on the player.<ref name="Famitsu1001"/> Nomura also wanted the character to have traits and perform actions that bore both heroic and villainous traits, creating someone akin to an [[anti-hero]]. He thought that these qualities would match the game's themes very well.<ref name="XVthemes"/> While naturally shy, Noctis hides this under a cold exterior, though his close friends can see through this.<ref name= "IGNnoctis"/> A key scene that demonstrated his personality in ''Versus XIII'' was his first meeting with Stella Nox Fleuret, the original heroine of ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII''.<ref name="NoctisScene"/>

According to Tabata, Noctis' cool mannerisms and reserved exterior stem from his lonely childhood, in addition to a fear of losing those closest to him. His words and actions stem from a fear of disappointing those around him, causing him to work to both fulfill expectations and bring people happiness as a result.<ref name="XVguideCollect2"/> When comparing the personalities of Noctis and Lunafreya, Tabata referred to Noctis as the weaker of the two, remarking that he is the one who needs protection instead of her.<ref name= "GIpersonality"/> A key part of his narrative is Noctis' transition from prince to king during his journey.<ref name="XVtabataBits"/> According to scenario writer Saori Itamuro, Noctis faces the future as king with both dread and acceptance as he was brought up to expect such an event. This part of his story influenced aspects of his appearance.<ref name="XVguideCollect2"/>

===Voice actors===
Noctis is voiced in Japanese by [[Tatsuhisa Suzuki]] as an adult, and by Miyuki Satō as a child.<ref name="BtVAnoctis"/> Suzuki was cast in 2009, seven years prior to the game's final release and when the project was still titled ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII''.<ref name="XVsuzuki"/><ref name="GWIsuzuki"/> When he was first voicing the character, Suzuki said Noctis was far more introverted, speaking with a gruff manner and showing little sympathy for those beyond his immediate circle. When the change was made to ''Final Fantasy XV'', Suzuki worked with the production team to create a new persona for the character, who became more outgoing and emotional.<ref name="FamitsuSuzuki"/> For the final game, Suzuki recorded his lines together with the rest of the central cast.<ref name="BrotherhoodSuzuki"/> To aid his performance, Suzuki modeled it on the stage mannerisms of [[Kurt Cobain]], lead singer of the grunge band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].<ref name="VentureNoctis"/> While he did not do continuous work on the game due to the game development's "twists and turns", he found himself constantly keeping the character in mind so he could easily portray him when it was time to record voicework for the game.<ref name="XVsuzuki"/> According to Suzuki, some of the recording work he did for ''Versus XIII'' survived and was incorporated into ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name="GWIsuzuki"/> When voicing the character for ''Brotherhood'', Suzuki—who had established a good rapport with the main cast—talked with them about how to shift their portrayals for the altered storytelling medium.<ref name="BrotherhoodSuzuki"/>

For the English localization, Noctis is voiced by [[Ray Chase (voice actor)|Ray Chase]] as an adult, and by Hyrum Hansen as a child.<ref name="BtVAnoctis"/> Localization lead writer Dan Inoue's English interpretation of the character was based by Suzuki's own influence.<ref name="VentureNoctis"/> Speaking about his role, Chase was told that rather than create an English version of the Japanese performance outside a few select scenes, Chase was told to make a performance that would resonate with Western audiences. This resulted in Noctis' English version being noticeably different from the Japanese.<ref name="DTnoctis"/> If anything seemed wrong, localization directors Inoue and Keythe Farley would call Chase in to re-record lines of dialogue.<ref name="DTnoctis"/><ref name="RPGFchase"/> Noctis was not only Chase's first ''Final Fantasy'' character, but his first major role in a video game project. He was initially shocked when he received the call that he would be voicing Noctis.<ref name="RPGFchase"/> Group recording efforts were discontinued due to the need to roughly match the English dialogue to precisely match timing for the Japanese performances.<ref name="DTnoctis"/> Only one scene was recorded with several English actors together: the opening scene of the game, where Noctis sets out on his journey.<ref name="RPGFchase"/>

English voice work was included for ''Episode Duscae'', but it was cut close in terms of production scheduling. During the ROM checking stage, Tabata saw that the performance was wrong for the character, a feeling reflected in player feedback after the demo's release. As it was too late to re-record, the performance was carried into the demo. Tabata commented that the original performance made the character sound too old, comparing it to [[Batman]]. After release, the voice work was redone to show the character's youth and charm, along with his "sense of [[ennui]]".<ref name= "NoctisEnglish"/> Due to the feedback from ''Episode Duscae'', the staff considered recasting Noctis's role, but instead Chase worked with the localization team to find a different voice for Noctis. After putting together a demo reel of Chase performing a variety of lines, Tabata listened and picked the one he thought best suited for the character. The most emotional part of the original recording for Chase was Noctis's final farewell to his comrades during a post-credit scene, which for Chase also symbolized saying goodbye to the localization team. A piece of late-game dialogue that needed re-recording was during Noctis's scene on the throne of Lucis at the end of the game; Noctis initially sounded on the point of tears, but the performance was redone to emphasise his resolve.<ref name="LifestreamChase"/>

== Appearances ==
===''Final Fantasy XV''===
Noctis Lucis Caelum is the only son and heir of King Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII of Lucis; the Caelum dynasty safeguards the Crystal, a divine artifact connected to the world's deities.<ref name="Famitsu 1281"/><ref name="KingsglaivePromotional"/> When he was five years old,<ref name="XVguideCollect1"/> Noctis was chosen by the Crystal as the "True King", a prophesied figure who would purge Eos of the Starscourge, a plague that will trigger eternal darkness on Eos and turns living things into monstrous Daemons. At eight years old, Noctis is attacked by a Daemon and is sent to the nation of Tenebrae for healing, where he meets and bonds with the nation's princess [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Lunafreya Nox Fleuret|Lunafreya Nox Fleuret]]. However, Noctis and Regis are forced to flee Tenebrae when it is attacked by the Niflheim Empire. By the events of ''Final Fantasy XV'', Lucis is besieged by Niflheim, and Regis agrees to a ceasefire. As part of the treaty, Noctis will marry Lunafreya, and Regis dispatches him to Altissia where they are to be married. Following Noctis' departure, Niflheim attacks Lucis' capital Insomnia, steals the Crystal and kills Regis. Noctis—together with his three companions and sworn protectors [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Gladiolus Amicitia|Gladiolus Amicitia]], [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Prompto Argentum|Prompto Argentum]] and [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Ignis Scientia|Ignis Scientia]]—sets out on a quest to retrieve the Crystal and defeat Niflheim.<ref name= "XVsummary1"/><ref name="XVsummary2"/>

To fulfill his role, Noctis collects the Royal Arms, weapons of the ancient Lucian monarchs, from tombs across Lucis. He also gains the blessing of the Astrals, divine beings who granted the Crystal to the Lucian line—he is in turn aided by Lunafreya, her attendant Gentiana, and Niflheim's chancellor [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Ardyn Izunia|Ardyn Izunia]].<ref name="QUOTEXVchap2"/><ref name="QUOTEXVchap4"/> Ardyn is later revealed to be Ardyn Lucis Caelum, the immortal older brother of Noctis's ancestor Somnus, who swore revenge on both the Crystal and Somnus's bloodline because he became corrupted by the Starscourge.<ref name="QUOTEXVchap13"/> Noctis gains the favor of the Astrals Titan and Ramuh,<ref name="QUOTEXVchap4"/><ref name="QUOTEXVchap5"/> but when he finally reaches Altissia and Lunafreya awakens the Astral Leviathan, Niflheim attacks and Ardyn mortally wounds Lunafreya, disrupting the ritual. With a last effort, she helps Noctis subdue Leviathan before giving him the Ring of the Lucii, an artifact through which he can access the Crystal's magic.<ref name="QUOTEXVchap9"/> Noctis heads for Niflheim's capital of Gralea, burdened by the loss of Lunafreya and tormented by Ardyn.<ref name="QUOTEXVchap10"/><ref name="QUOTEXVchap11"/><ref name="QUOTEXVchap12"/>

Arriving in Gralea to find its population turned into Daemons, Noctis finds and is pulled into the Crystal. Noctis learns from the Astral Bahamut of Providence, a power borne from the combined might of the Crystal, the Royal Arms and the Ring of the Lucii capable of destroying the Starscourge forever, the price of wielding it being Noctis's own life.<ref name="QUOTEXVchap13"/> Waking up ten years later, Noctis reunites with his companions as they travel to Insomnia where they defeat the rogue Astral Ifrit and the enslaved Lucii before facing Ardyn. After defeating Ardyn in the physical world, Noctis sacrifices himself to fulfill his role as the True King by purging the Starscourge, destroying Ardyn's spirit in the afterlife with the aid of the Lucii. In the game's mid-credits and post-credit scenes, Noctis confesses his feelings for his friends during a rest before the final battle, and reunites with Lunafreya in the afterlife.<ref name="QUOTEXVchap14"/>
