==Architecture==
Designed by George Martell Miller in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style, the building features [[Indiana Limestone]] facades with columns topped with Ionic capitals. There are several [[pediment]]s including one supported by columns forming the grand [[portico]] fronting Queen's Park. The interior of the University of Toronto part of the building has been kept almost unchanged, featuring marble tile flooring and finishes, while the Club Monaco interiors were modified to fit the needs of a retail store. 

Fort Architects renovated the interior of Club Monaco's part of the building with drywall and hardwood flooring before installing shelves. The original underground pool was covered by a false floor to house the men's section of the store.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lillian Massey Department of Household Science|url=http://www.greatspaces.utoronto.ca/historicspaces/historic_lmd.htm|publisher=U of T Capital Projects|accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref> Landscaping was kept to a minimum as tree planters were used in front of the Club Monaco facade to frame its entrance.
