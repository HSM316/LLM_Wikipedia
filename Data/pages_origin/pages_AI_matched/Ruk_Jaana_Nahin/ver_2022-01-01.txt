==Reception==
''[[The Indian Express]]'' reviewed, "The story is interesting. The setting is not your usual badi havelis but a realistic background where characters speak authentic language of the region. The dialogues are crisp and refreshing. Credit goes to the producers Paresh Rawal and Hemal Thakkar, the writer and co-producer Kamal Pandey and director Santram Verma to put together a watchable show. The performances too are consistently good. Leading the pack is Pooja Sharma as Sanchi, who is raw but has an endearing quality. The story moves at a good pace and so far has been both engaging and entertaining. It's a great respite from mundane family dramas."<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Ruk Jaana Nahin review|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/ruk-jaana-nahin/901598/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=The Indian Express}}</ref>
