'''Petronilla of Lorraine''' ({{circa}} 1082 – 23 May 1144) was [[Count of Holland|Countess of Holland]] by marriage to [[Floris II, Count of Holland]], and regent of the [[County of Holland]] during the [[Minor (law)|minority]] of her son [[Dirk VI, Count of Holland|Dirk VI]] in 1121-1129.<ref>Kloek, Els (2013), 1001 Vrouwen uit de Nederlandse Geschiedenis, Nijmegen: Vantilt, pp. 20–22, {{ISBN|978-94-6004-141-9}}</ref> She was a daughter of [[Theodoric II, Duke of Lorraine]] and [[Hedwig of Formbach]].

==Biography==
Named after her maternal grandmother, she changed her name from Gertrude to Petronilla after her marriage in 1100.

In 1121, after her husband's early death, she became regent for their son, Dirk VI. She is described as an ambitious and dominant regent who ruled with a "strong hand".<ref>Kloek, Els (2013), 1001 Vrouwen uit de Nederlandse Geschiedenis, Nijmegen: Vantilt, pp. 20–22, {{ISBN|978-94-6004-141-9}}</ref>  In 1123-25, she gave military support to her brother the emperor in his struggle with his rival emperor Henry.  After [[Baldwin VII, Count of Flanders]] died without heirs, she supported her son's claim to become [[Count of Flanders]] during the Flemish succession war of 1127, but Baldwin was eventually succeeded by [[Charles I, Count of Flanders|Charles I]].

Her mandate as regent formally expired when her son reached maturity in 1129, but according to contemporary Egmond chronicle, she remained de facto regent until 1133.<ref>Kloek, Els (2013), 1001 Vrouwen uit de Nederlandse Geschiedenis, Nijmegen: Vantilt, pp. 20–22, {{ISBN|978-94-6004-141-9}}</ref> 
In the struggle for power between Dirk and his younger brother, [[Floris the Black]] in 1129-31, she supported the latter upon his first attempt. In 1131, however, she retracted her support and refused to support him.

Petronilla founded [[Rijnsburg Abbey]] in 1133, where it seems that she retired from court and politics and spent the rest of her life. She was also buried there after her death in 1144. Petronilla descendant [[Ada van Holland (died 1258)|Ada]] was still in charge in the 1200s. She was abbess when her cousin sold the abbey and Ada was obliged to use her own money to repurchase it.<ref name=bit>{{Cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vrouwenlexicon/lemmata/data/AdavanHollandvanRijnsburg|title=Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland|last=djr|date=2019-09-17|website=resources.huygens.knaw.nl|language=Dutch|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref>
