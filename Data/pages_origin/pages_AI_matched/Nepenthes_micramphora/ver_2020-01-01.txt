'''''Nepenthes micramphora''''' is a tropical [[pitcher plant]] known only from [[Mount Hamiguitan]] on the island of [[Mindanao]] in the [[Philippines]].<ref name=description /> It is a highland plant growing at elevations of 1100–1635&nbsp;m.<ref name=description />

''Nepenthes micramphora'' is closely allied to ''[[Nepenthes abgracilis|N.&nbsp;abgracilis]]'' and ''[[Nepenthes cid|N.&nbsp;cid]]'', both also from Mindanao, and together these species comprise the informal "[[#N. micramphora group|''N.&nbsp;micramphora'' group]]".<ref name=group>Cheek, M. & M. Jebb 2013. The ''Nepenthes micramphora'' (Nepenthaceae) group, with two new species from Mindanao, Philippines. ''Phytotaxa'' '''151'''(1): 25–34. {{DOI|10.11646/phytotaxa.151.1.2}}</ref>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''micramphora'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''mikros'' (small) and [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:amphora|amphora]]'' ([[amphora]], [[urn]]), and references the tiny pitchers of this species.<ref name=McPherson>McPherson, S.R. 2009.

==Botanical history==
''Nepenthes micramphora'' was [[Species description|formally described]] in 2009 by [[Volker Heinrich]], [[Stewart McPherson (geographer)|Stewart McPherson]], [[Thomas Gronemeyer]], and [[Victor Amoroso]]. The description was published in the second volume of McPherson's ''[[Pitcher Plants of the Old World]]''.<ref name=description /> The [[herbarium]] specimen ''V.Amoroso & R.Aspiras'' CMUH 00003545 is the designated [[holotype]], and is deposited at the [[Central Mindanao University|Central Mindanao University Herbarium]] in [[Musuan]], [[Bukidnon]], the [[Philippines]].<ref name=description /> It was collected on 31 January 2005, from [[Mount Hamiguitan]], on the trail from [[San Isidro, Davao Oriental|San Isidro]], at an altitude of 1300–1600&nbsp;m.<ref name=description />

Inflorescence measurements for the formal description were taken by [[Volker Heinrich]] at the [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]] on 22 July 2008, since herbarium material of the floral structures could not be located.<ref name=description />

==Description==
''Nepenthes micramphora'' is a climbing plant growing to a height of 2.5&nbsp;m.<ref name=hamiguitanensis>Gronemeyer, T., A. Wistuba, V. Heinrich, S. McPherson, F. Mey & A. Amoroso 2010. ''Nepenthes hamiguitanensis'' (Nepenthaceae), a new pitcher plant species from Mindanao Island, Philippines. In: S.R. McPherson ''Carnivorous Plants and their Habitats''. Volume 2. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp. 1296–1305.</ref> The stem is circular in cross section and up to 3.5&nbsp;mm in diameter, with [[internode (botany)|internodes]] up to 15&nbsp;mm long.<ref name=description />

[[File:Nepenthes micramphora.jpg|thumb|left|A typical upper pitcher]]

===Leaves===
Leaves are [[wikt:sessile|sessile]] and [[wikt:coriaceous|coriaceous]] in texture. The [[Leaf#Anatomy|lamina]] (leaf blade) is [[wikt:lanceolate|lanceolate]]-elliptic in shape and reaches 8&nbsp;cm in length by 1&nbsp;cm in width,<ref name=description /> being widest in its distal half.<ref name=group /> The lamina has an acute apex and is shortly [[wikt:attenuate|attenuate]] at the base, clasping the stem for approximately one-third of its circumference. It is not [[wikt:decurrent|decurrent]] down the stem. Two to three longitudinal veins are present on either side of the [[midrib]], while [[wikt:pinnate|pinnate]] veins are numerous. [[Tendril]]s are up to 7.5&nbsp;cm long and 1&nbsp;mm wide.<ref name=description />

===Pitchers===
Rosette and lower pitchers are narrowly [[wikt:ovate|ovate]] in the basal portion and cylindrical or sometimes slightly [[wikt:infundibular|infundibular]] above.<ref name=McPherson /> They are very small, reaching only 4.1&nbsp;cm in height by 1.6&nbsp;cm in width. A pair of wings (≤4&nbsp;mm wide) typically runs down the [[ventral]] surface of the pitcher cup, although these may be reduced to ribs.<ref name=McPherson /> The wings bear fringe elements measuring around 3&nbsp;mm and spaced 2.5–3&nbsp;mm apart. Only the basal third of the interior surface of the pitcher is [[gland]]ular. The [[peristome]] is cylindrical and up to 0.8&nbsp;mm wide, bearing ribs up to 0.1&nbsp;mm high and spaced 0.1&nbsp;mm apart.<ref name=McPherson /> Teeth are not visible on the inner margin of the peristome.<ref name=group /> The pitcher lid or [[operculum (botany)|operculum]] may be elliptic, ovate, or [[wikt:orbicular|orbicular]], and generally has a [[wikt:cordate|cordate]] base.<ref name=McPherson /> The lid lacks appendages<ref name=McPherson /> and measures up to 2&nbsp;cm in length by 1.8&nbsp;cm in width, being slightly wider than the pitcher mouth.<ref name=description /> The nectar glands of the lower lid surface number more than 100.<ref name=group /> A branched or divided<ref name=McPherson /> [[spur (botany)|spur]] (≤3&nbsp;mm long) is inserted near the base of the lid.<ref name=description />

[[File:Nepenthes micramphora3.jpg|thumb|240px|A [[rosette (botany)|rosette]] plant with a bright red stem]]

Upper pitchers are produced from an early age.<ref name=McPherson /> They may be infundibular throughout<ref name=description /> or narrowly infundibular in their basal part, becoming narrower and roughly cylindrical above.<ref name=McPherson /> They are broadest in the middle or in the upper portion.<ref name=group /> Aerial pitchers are larger than their terrestrial counterparts, growing to 6.7&nbsp;cm in height by 2&nbsp;cm in width (although more often around 4&nbsp;cm by 1.7&nbsp;cm).<ref name=McPherson /> The pitcher lid is of the same width as the mouth. Wings are always reduced to ribs.<ref name=McPherson /> In other respects, upper pitchers are similar to the lower traps.<ref name=description />

===Inflorescence===
''Nepenthes micramphora'' has a [[raceme|racemose]] [[inflorescence]] measuring up to 35&nbsp;cm in length by 6&nbsp;mm in width. The [[peduncle (botany)|peduncle]] itself may be up to 8&nbsp;cm long and 1&nbsp;mm wide. Flowers are borne on one-flowered, non-[[bract]]eate [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicels]] (3–4&nbsp;mm long), of which there are between 20 and 40 on the inflorescence. The ovate [[tepal]]s measure up to 2.5&nbsp;mm in length by 1.2&nbsp;mm in width. [[Fruit]]s are up to 20&nbsp;mm long.<ref name=description />

===Indumentum===
The stem, lamina, and pitchers are [[wikt:glabrous|glabrous]]. An inconspicuous [[indumentum]] of simple, rusty brown hairs (0.1&nbsp;mm long) covers the inflorescence.<ref name=description />

==Ecology==
===Distribution===
[[File:Hamiguitan bonsai tree.JPG|thumb|A stunted tree growing in the "Bonsai Forest" of [[Mount Hamiguitan]]]]
''Nepenthes micramphora'' has only been recorded from the highland slopes of [[Mount Hamiguitan]], [[Davao Oriental]], in the extreme southeast of [[Mindanao]] island in the [[Philippines]]. Much of the surrounding region has not been explored for ''Nepenthes'', and this species may therefore be present in other parts of southern Mindanao.<ref name=McPherson /> Its altitudinal distribution extends from 1100&nbsp;m [[above sea level]] to the summit at 1635&nbsp;m.<ref name=description />

===Habitat===
This species grows [[terrestrial plant|terrestrially]] in a wide range of habitats, including upper montane [[mossy forest]], [[secondary vegetation]], ridge tops, cliff sides, and [[landslide]]s.<ref name=McPherson /> It has also been recorded at the margins of [[montane forest]] around the so-called [[Pygmy forest|Bonsai Forest]],<ref name=description /> which is named for its stunted trees. The species is restricted to [[ultramafic rock|ultramafic]] [[substrate (biology)|substrates]]. While ''N.&nbsp;micramphora'' tolerates shady conditions, it grows best under direct sunlight.<ref name=McPherson /> On Mount Hamiguitan, ''N.&nbsp;micramphora'' is sympatric with ''[[Nepenthes alata|N.&nbsp;alata]]'' (''[[sensu lato]]''), ''[[Nepenthes justinae|N.&nbsp;justinae]]''<ref name=aenigma>Gronemeyer, T., W. Suarez, H. Nuytemans, M. Calaramo, A. Wistuba, F.S. Mey & V.B. Amoroso 2016. Two new ''Nepenthes'' species from the Philippines and an emended description of ''Nepenthes ramos''. ''Plants'' '''5'''(2): 23. {{DOI|10.3390/plants5020023}}</ref> (previously identified as ''[[Nepenthes mindanaoensis|N.&nbsp;mindanaoensis]]''), and ''[[Nepenthes peltata|N.&nbsp;peltata]]'',<ref name=description /> and grows in the same altitudinal range as ''[[Nepenthes hamiguitanensis|N.&nbsp;hamiguitanensis]]''.<ref name=hamiguitanensis /> Despite this, no [[natural hybrid]]s have been observed with certainty.

===Conservation status===
In his 2009 book, ''[[Pitcher Plants of the Old World]]'', [[Stewart McPherson (geographer)|Stewart McPherson]] writes that ''N.&nbsp;micramphora'' is "not currently threatened" owing to its extensive populations on Mount Hamiguitan and the fact that visitors are only permitted to climb the mountain with the assistance of a guide.<ref name=McPherson /> The future of wild populations of ''N.&nbsp;micramphora'' will be further secured if provincial officials of [[Davao Oriental]] are successful in their bid to gain recognition of Mount Hamiguitan as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name=McPherson /><ref>UNESCO National Commission of the Philippines 2008.

''Nepenthes micramphora'' gives its name to the informal "''N.&nbsp;micramphora'' group", which also includes ''[[Nepenthes abgracilis|N.&nbsp;abgracilis]]'' from northeastern Mindanao and ''[[Nepenthes cid|N.&nbsp;cid]]'' from north-central Mindanao. This group was introduced by [[Martin Cheek]] and [[Matthew Jebb]] in a 2013 paper that also included the [[species description|formal descriptions]] of the latter two species.<ref name=group /> Before this, ''N.&nbsp;micramphora'' was considered an outlier or species of [[incertae sedis|uncertain placement]] that did not fall into any of the established groups of Philippine ''Nepenthes'' (the three main ones being the ''[[Nepenthes alata group|N.&nbsp;alata]]'', ''[[Nepenthes ventricosa group|N.&nbsp;ventricosa]]'', and ''[[Nepenthes villosa group|N.&nbsp;villosa]]'' species groups).<ref name=recircumscription>Cheek, M. & M. Jebb 2013. Recircumscription of the ''Nepenthes alata'' group (Caryophyllales: Nepenthaceae), in the Philippines, with four new species. ''European Journal of Taxonomy'' '''69''': 1–23. {{DOI|10.5852/ejt.2013.69}}</ref>

''Nepenthes abgracilis'', ''N.&nbsp;cid'' and ''N.&nbsp;micramphora'' are united by aspects of pitcher and stem morphology as well as shared habitat preferences. Cheek and Jebb identified seven diagnostic characters that they used to define the group:<ref name=group />

<blockquote>
#[[submontane]] habitat;
#stems [[wikt:terete|terete]];
#peristome slender, cylindrical, 0.8–2&nbsp;mm wide;
#peristome ridges low, about 0.1&nbsp;mm high, inconspicuous;
#inner edge of peristome without visible teeth (in natural position);
#lower surface of lid lacking a basal ridge and appendage;
#lid nectar glands >100, monomorphic, large (ca. 0.5&nbsp;mm diam.) with a narrow border, ± evenly spread over the lid</blockquote>

These species show some similarities to those of the [[Nepenthes alata group|''N.&nbsp;alata'' group]], but differ in lacking a basal ridge or appendage on the lower surface of the lid.<ref name=group />

''Nepenthes cid'' differs from the other two species of the ''N.&nbsp;micramphora'' group in growth habit (it is [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] as opposed to terrestrial), [[indumentum]] development (vegetative parts hairy as opposed to [[wikt:glabrous|subglabrous]]), and in having a distinct [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] (versus [[wikt:sessile|sessile]] in the other two).<ref name=group /> Both it and ''N.&nbsp;abgracilis'' have [[wikt:entire|entire]] spurs, as compared to branched in ''N.&nbsp;micramphora''.<ref name=group />

''Nepenthes micramphora'' is most easily distinguished from ''N.&nbsp;abgracilis'' by its upper pitchers, which are more-or-less [[wikt:infundibular|infundibular]] (versus subcylindric in ''N.&nbsp;abgracilis''), narrowest at the base and widest in the middle or upper half (versus widest near the base), and much smaller in all respects (≤6.7&nbsp;cm versus {{circa}} 16&nbsp;cm high).<ref name=group />

''Nepenthes micramphora'' is very similar to ''[[Nepenthes bellii|N.&nbsp;bellii]]'' of northern Mindanao in terms of the morphology of its stem, lamina, and inflorescence. Indeed, prior to the description of ''N.&nbsp;micramphora'' in 2009, the species was misidentified as ''N.&nbsp;bellii'' on its native [[Mount Hamiguitan]].<ref>Amoroso, V.B., L.D. Obsioma, J.B.

It also produces a greater abundance of pitchers on its [[rosette (botany)|rosettes]] — up to 7 live traps have been recorded at any one time.<ref name=description />

''[[Nepenthes gracilis]]'' also bears a superficial resemblance to ''N.&nbsp;micramphora'' in the size and shape of its leaves, but this species is absent from the Philippines.<ref name=McPherson />

==Natural hybrids==
''Nepenthes micramphora'' has no confirmed [[natural hybrid]]s, although certain plants from [[Mount Hamiguitan]] may represent crosses involving it and ''[[Nepenthes hamiguitanensis|N.&nbsp;hamiguitanensis]]'', ''[[Nepenthes justinae|N.&nbsp;justinae]]''<ref name=aenigma /> (previously identified as ''[[Nepenthes mindanaoensis|N.&nbsp;mindanaoensis]]''), and ''[[Nepenthes peltata|N.&nbsp;peltata]]''.<ref name=M&A2011>McPherson, S.R. & V.B.
