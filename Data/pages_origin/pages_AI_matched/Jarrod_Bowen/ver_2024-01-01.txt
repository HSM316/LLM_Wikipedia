==Style of play==
Regarded as a quick, direct, mobile, energetic player with good technique and an eye for goal, Bowen is predominantly known for his speed, movement, clinical finishing, agility and ball control, as well as his ability to use both his pace and flair on the ball to create scoring opportunities for himself or his teammates. A versatile [[Forward (association football)|forward]], he primarily plays as a [[Winger (association football)|winger]] on the right flank, a position which allows him to cut into the centre onto his stronger left foot, and either shoot on goal or play quick exchanges with other players and make runs in behind the defence towards goal. He can also play in the centre, behind the main striker as either an [[attacking midfielder]] or [[second striker]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Jarrod Bowen {{!}} West Ham United|url=https://www.whufc.com/teams/first-team/squad/jarrod-bowen#Profile|access-date=11 February 2022|publisher=West Ham United F.C.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jarrod Bowen joins West Ham United {{!}} West Ham United|url=https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2020/january/31-january/jarrod-bowen-joins-west-ham-united|access-date=11 February 2022|publisher=West Ham United F.C.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jarrod Bowen, West Ham hungry for a trophy, ready to crash Premier League top four {{!}} NBC Sports |via=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnSALV1zlAM|access-date=11 February 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Can Jarrod Bowen get an England call up?🔥🔴 Stuart Pearce says Southgate will have his eye on Bowen! |via=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_64pKevd4kQ|access-date=11 February 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=16 January 2019 |title=Jarrod Bowen: from playing without pay to scoring for fun at Hull |url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2019/jan/16/jarrod-bowen-hull-championship-hereford |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=11 February 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=20 September 2021 |title=Jarrod Bowen offers glimpse of why Liverpool, Spurs and Leicester are circling |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/jarrod-bowen-west-ham-transfer-b1923015.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |access-date=11 February 2022}}</ref> In 2023 he began playing as a central striker while [[Michail Antonio]] was injured, and impressed manager David Moyes with his performances and versatility.<ref>{{cite web |date=13 December 2023 |title=Bowen as central striker 'an option going forward' for Moyes |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/crgjnqe02v5o |access-date=24 December 2023 |website=BBC Sport}}</ref>
