The first documentary reference to Hembury Castle is in the 13th-century [[cartulary]] of nearby [[Buckfast Abbey]], where it is referred to as ''vetus castellum quod dicitur Hembire''. The name probably derives from [[Old English]] ''hean byrig'', "at the high [[burh]]".<ref>{{Cite journal

A legend relates that the fort was held by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)#Danelaw|Danes]], but it was taken from them by a stratagem. Some local women allowed themselves to be captured by the Danes and taken into the fort, but in the night when their captors were in a drunken sleep, the women rose, killed them and let in their countrymen.<ref name=C />
