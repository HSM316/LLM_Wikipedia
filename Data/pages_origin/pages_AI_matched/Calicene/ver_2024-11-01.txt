'''Calicene''' or '''triapentafulvalene''' is a [[hydrocarbon]] of the [[Fulvalenes|fulvalene class]] with [[chemical formula]] C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, composed of a [[cyclopentadiene]] ring and a [[cyclopropene]] ring linked by a [[double bond]]. Its name is derived from the Latin ''calix'' meaning "goblet", from its shape.

==Properties==
Very high resonance energy is predicted by the [[Hückel method]],<ref>{{cite journal | last = Schaad| first = L. J. | author2 = B. Andes Hess, Jr |title = Dewar Resonance Energy | journal = Chemical Reviews | year = 2001 | volume = 101 | issue = 5 | pages = 1465–1476 | doi = 10.1021/cr9903609 | pmid = 11710229 }}</ref> however its resonance energy is not high.
The central double bond is [[electric dipole moment|polarized]] with a partial positive charge on the carbon atom of triangular ring and a partial negative charge on the carbon atom of pentagonal ring, in keeping with added [[Hückel's rule]] stability of rings containing 2&nbsp;[[pi electron|π electron]]s and 6&nbsp;π electrons respectively. Calicene's dipole moment has been computed to be 4.66&nbsp;[[Debye|D]].<ref name= "bicalicene">{{cite journal | last =  Oziminski | first = W. P. | author2 = M.

Several compounds that contains two or more calicene subunits are aromatic, such as [[Bicalicene|''trans''-bicalicene]]<ref name= "bicalicene" /> (ring compound) or poly-2,7-[N]calicenes (chain compound)<ref>{{cite journal | last = Ratanadachanakin | first = Thawalrat | author2 = Collier, Willard E.

Despite several attempts to prepare it, the parent calicene has so far defied attempts at synthesis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Houben-Weyl Methods of Organic Chemistry Vol. E 17d, 4th Edition Supplement: Carbocyclic Three-Membered Ring Compounds, Cyclopropenes, Author Index, Compound Index|last=de Meijere|first=Armin|publisher=Georg Thieme Verlag|year=2014|isbn=978-3131819741|location=Stuttgart|pages=2967}}</ref>  However, 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexaphenylcalicene has been prepared and an experimental dipole moment of 6.3 D was measured.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Agranat|first1=Israel|last2=Bergmann|first2=Ernst D.|date=1965-01-01|title=Hexaphenyltriapentafulvalene|journal=Chemical Communications|language=en|issue=21|pages=512–513|doi=10.1039/C19650000512|issn=0009-241X}}</ref>
