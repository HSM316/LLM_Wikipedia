'''RV ''Corella (LT767)''''' was a fisheries [[research vessel]] that was operated by the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)]] -  Directorate of Fisheries, now known as the [[Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science]] (Cefas) between 1967 and 1983.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Trawling Through Time: Cefas Science and Data 1902-2014|last=Cefas|publisher=Cefas|year=2014|isbn=|location=Lowestoft|pages=5}}</ref>

She was constructed by [[Brooke Marine]] in [[Lowestoft]], and subsequently operated out of the port of [[Lowestoft]].

In 1983 the RV ''Corella'' was sold to Warbler Shipping and renamed '''MV ''Dawn Sky'''''. In 1985 she was converted into an offshore supply vessel and one of her two distinctive A-frame winches was removed. Between 1986 and 1988 the ''Dawn Sky'' was re-chartered for government fisheries survey work, both by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (Scotland) and the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)]].

Warbler Shipping was bought by Putford Enterprises (of [[Great Yarmouth]]) in 1994, subsequently part of the American supply ship operators [[Seacor Holdings]].<ref name=":15">Ship Details:  Putford Sky – Seacor Marine. http://www.seacormarine.com/pdf/20_Survivor_SBSV_Putford_Sky.pdf Accessed 19/06/2018</ref> The MV ''Dawn Sky'' was renamed '''MV ''Putford Sky''''' and was used by BP on the Amethyst gas field off [[Yorkshire]]. She was sold to Fornæs Shipbreaking for scrapping in Denmark,<ref name=":13">PUTFORD SKY - IMO 6607393  - The last remnants of Putford Sky at Fornæs Shipbreaking Ltd. Grenaa . http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=1546745 Accessed 19/06/2018</ref> leaving [[Great Yarmouth]] 6 April 2012 on her final voyage to [[Grenaa]], 45 years after she had been constructed.

==Construction==
The RV ''Corella'' was constructed by [[Brooke Marine]] having been commissioned by the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)]] to replace its earlier (1946–1967) research vessel the ''RV Platessa''. The ''RV Platessa'' had primarily been used to survey [[herring]], [[plaice]] and other inshore fish resources in the southern [[North Sea]], [[English Channel]] and [[Irish Sea]].<ref name=":1"/>

[[Brooke Marine]] (also known as J.W. Brooke & Co. and Brooke Yachts) was a [[Lowestoft]]-based shipbuilding firm. The company constructed boats and small ships for civilian and commercial use, as well as minor warships for the [[Royal Navy]]. The company was founded in 1874 and operated until 1992.

Construction started at [[Brooke Marine]] in 1964, and it was hoped that the RV ''Corella'' (named after the sea-squirt ''Corella parallelogramma'') would come into service in early 1965, but in reality that did not happen until April 1967.<ref name=":1"/>

The RV ''Corella'' is regarded as the first ‘modern’ [[research vessel]] owned and operated by the Directorate of Fisheries.  Her deck, laboratory equipment and electric power supplies were more sophisticated in comparison with her predecessors such as the contemporaneous RV ''Clione''. She had advanced noise suppression systems in her engine room to allow acoustic surveying of fish populations.<ref name=":1"/>

Sea trials took place from 17 to 21 March 1967 and highlighted initial deficiencies with regard to winches and their hydraulic drive system, that would require time to be remedied.<ref name=":8">RV Corella 1/67, Cruise summary report - 
https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/inventories/cruise_inventory/report/7714/ Accessed 19/06/2018
</ref>  The maiden voyage of the '''RV ''Corella''''' began on 20 April 1967 (until 25 March), with the aim to determine the best methods of handling each type of trawl, to make a first assessment of trawling performance and to learn how to operate a purse-seine from this ship, off the Farne Deeps, and [[Flamborough Head]] in the [[North Sea]].<ref name=":8"/>

A 20&nbsp;ft ‘bos boat’ ([[skiff]]) was purchased from [[Norway]] and named the ''Caranx'', that could either be carried by the RV Corella for use in purse seining or be used for longshore work. The RV ''Corella'' was subsequently found to be unsuitable for [[purse seine]] operations and such little use was made of the ''Caranx'' that it was eventually sold.<ref name=":1"/>

==Service as a fisheries research vessel==
The RV ''Corella (LT767)'' was in service with Directorate of Fisheries from 20 April 1967 until 15 December 1982, during which time she participated in 266 separate research campaigns.<ref name=":7">British Oceanographic Research Centre – Cruise Inventory, https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/inventories/cruise_inventory/ Accessed 19/06/2018</ref>

Throughout her working life the RV ''Corella'' was engaged in acoustic surveys of fish populations. Notably, in June 1967, the [[Lowestoft]] Fisheries Laboratory cooperated with the [[Admiralty Research Laboratory]] to identify fish detected by long-range sonar equipment installed at the [[British Admiralty|Admiralty]] Experimental Station, [[Perranporth]]. The RV ''Corella'' was directed from the shore to an area some 65&nbsp;km distant, that was returning a strong and extended echo. The ''Corella'' was able to correlate this target with shoals detected on a conventional [[echo sounder]], and substantial catches of sprats were taken in the area using a midwater trawl.<ref name=":2">Revie, J., Weston, D.E., Harden-Jones, F.R., Fox, G.P. (1990) Identification of fish echoes located at 65 km range by shore-based sonar. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 46 (3): 313–324.</ref>

The RV ''Corella'' was used throughout the 1970s for pioneering studies on fish migration. Individual plaice (''Pleuronectes platessa'')  fitted with 300&nbsp;kHz acoustic transponding tags were tracked by sector scanning [[sonar]] off the [[East Anglian]] coast for periods up to 54 hours and over distances up to 61&nbsp;km. The semidiurnal (12 h period) vertical movements were clearly related to the [[tidal cycle]], ascents being more closely linked to slack water than descents. The regular pattern of behaviour – called ''selective tidal stream transport'' – was shown to provide a quick and economical means of movement for fish on migration through areas with strong tides.<ref name=":3">Greer-Walker, M., Harden-Jones, F.R., Arnold, G.P. (1978) The movements of plaice (''Pleuronectes platessa'' L.) tracked in the open sea. ICES Journal of Marine Science, Volume 38, Issue 1, 1 April 1978, pp. 58–86.</ref>

On 7 January 1984, the ''Lowestoft Journal'' featured a story titled ''"crew members shocked as redundancies announced and the fisheries vessel `Corella` laid up and perhaps sold off"''.<ref name=":4">Lowestoft Journal, press-cutting file - http://www.dswebhosting.info/Suffolk/SRODServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Site31&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=(RefNo==%271176%2F2%2F2%2F6%2F25%27) Accessed 19/06/2018 .</ref>

In 1985 she was sold to Warbler Shipping and converted into an offshore supply vessel. In June 1986 as the MV ''Dawn Sky'' she was chartered by the [[Scottish Association for Marine Science]] – Dunstaffnage laboratory, to deploy [[current meter]]s in the [[Irish Sea]], as well as to engage in water sampling and phytoplankton distribution mapping. In November 1986 she was re-hired by the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)]] (MAFF) -  Burnham Laboratory for sediment and fish sampling off the [[Humber]] and in the [[North Sea]].<ref name=":9">MV Dawn Sky DSK1/86, Cruise summary report - https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/inventories/cruise_inventory/report/3043/ Accessed 19/06/2018</ref>

In 1987 the MV ''Dawn Sky'' was hired by MAFF to deploy [[current meter]] moorings in the Eastern [[Irish Sea]], to lay sea bed Drifters east of the [[Isle of Wight]],<ref name=":11">MV Dawn Sky DSK1/87, Cruise summary report - https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/inventories/cruise_inventory/report/3166/ Accessed 19/06/2018</ref> and by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (Scotland) -  to undertake a routine demersal trawling survey on Rockall Bank.<ref name=":10">MV Dawn Sky, Cruise summary report - https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/inventories/cruise_inventory/report/3167/ Accessed 19/06/2018</ref>

In March 1988 the MV ''Dawn Sky'' was hired by MAFF for a final time, to collect surface seawater samples at stations around the west and North of [[Scotland]], as well as near bottom samples for [[Caesium-137|radiocaesium]] analysis.<ref name=":12">MV Dawn Sky DSK1/88, Cruise summary report - https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/inventories/cruise_inventory/report/4892/ Accessed 19/06/2018</ref>
