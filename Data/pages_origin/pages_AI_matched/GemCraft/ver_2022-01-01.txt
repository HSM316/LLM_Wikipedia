In ''GemCraft'', players are given [[gem]]s to combine and place into towers. Different combinations of gems produce different effects, such as [[splash damage]], [[damage over time]], and [[critical hit]] capability. The player's life bar and magic energy are represented by the same statistic—[[Magic (game terminology)|mana]]. With mana, the player can forge and combine gems and build towers, trenches, and traps. A key aspect of strategy in ''GemCraft'' is to increase the player's mana gain to high levels, enabling creation of stronger and stronger gems. Combining two gems creates a single more powerful gem, with the gem's power level indicated by its shape.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Plot==
The series is set in a fantasy world. It depicts the battles of wizards against a powerful demon known as "The Forgotten". Wizards used to regularly summon demons to do their bidding until they brought forth a demon too powerful for them to control, who was also capable of subduing other demons under her command. Described as "a fully black female torso with disfigured arms, a head with long hair and no face", the Forgotten commands her legions in order to conquer the "Spiritforge", the last bastion of the wizards, in order to become omnipotent. There is no known way to destroy The Forgotten or to banish her back to the Demon Realm from which she was summoned. Instead, she can be sealed away by a powerful artifact known as a "Gem of Eternity", but it can only contain her for a few decades before she escapes, and each time she escapes, a new gem must be crafted in order to capture her again.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=November 2020}}
[[Gamezebo]] gave the original ''GemCraft'' game a rating of 3.5/5, stating: "While ''GemCraft'' isn't a revolutionary effort, it adds some new wrinkles into the usual 'build, defend, build' cycle in the genre re-popularized by ''[[Desktop Tower Defense]]''."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamezebo.com/games/gemcraft/review |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324140023/http://www.gamezebo.com/games/gemcraft/review |archive-date=2012-03-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
