The '''BAT F.K.25 Basilisk''' was a prototype [[United Kingdom|British]] [[fighter aircraft]] of the [[World War I|First World War]]. A single engined [[biplane]] intended to meet a requirement to replace the [[Sopwith Snipe]], the Basilisk was unsuccessful, only three being built.

==Development and design==
In 1918, the British [[Air Ministry]] issued the RAF Type 1 specification for a single-seat fighter, powered by the new (and untried) [[ABC Dragonfly]] air cooled [[radial engine]] to replace the [[Sopwith Snipe]]. To meet this requirement, [[Frederick Koolhoven]], (formerly of [[Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft]] and before that [[Société Pour L'Aviation et ses Dérivés|Deperdussin]]) chief designer of the [[British Aerial Transport]] Company of London, designed the F.K. 25 Basilisk.<ref name="Lewis Fighter p128,130">Lewis 1979, pp.128, 130.</ref>

Like Koolhovens earlier [[BAT Bantam|F.K.23 Bantam]], the Basilisk was a two-bay [[biplane]] with a wooden [[monocoque]] fuselage, but was larger and heavier to accommodate the larger engine and the equipment required by the Specification.  Armament was two [[Vickers machine gun]]s mounted ahead of the pilot, and enclosed in a large fairing that formed the upper coaming of the pilot's cockpit.<ref name="Mason Fighter p140">Mason 1992, p.140.</ref><ref name="Bruce British p75">Bruce 1957, p.75.</ref>

Three prototypes were ordered in early 1918, and the first one flew in September 1918.<ref name="Mason Fighter p140"/> It was destroyed on 3 May 1919 when attempting to break the [[Flight altitude record|World altitude record]], its engine catching fire and BAT's test pilot, Peter Legh, being killed after he jumped clear.<ref name="Mason Fighter p140"/><ref name="Bruce v1 p64"/><ref>''Flight'' 8 May 1919, p.616.</ref>  The second and third prototype were fitted with modified, horn balanced ailerons, with the second prototype tested at [[RAF Martlesham Heath|Martlesham Heath]] in October 1919.  While its performance was good (although not as good as claimed by BAT), the Dragonfly engine was hopelessly unreliable, with further development or production abandoned earlier in the year, and the Basilisk was abandoned when Koolhoven left BAT at the end of 1919.<ref name="Bruce v1 p64"/>
