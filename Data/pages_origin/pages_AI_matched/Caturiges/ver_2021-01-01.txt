{{short description|Gallic tribe}}
The '''Caturiges''' ([[Gaulish language|Gaulish]]: "kings of combat"; {{lang-la|Caturĭges}}, {{lang-el|Κατόριγες}}) were a [[Gauls|Gallic]] tribe of the [[La Tène culture|Iron Age]], dwelling in the [[Alpes Cottiae]] around present-day [[Chorges]] and [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]].{{sfn|Graßl|2006}}

== Name ==
They are mentioned as ''Caturiges'' by [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] (mid-1st c. BC) and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (1st c. AD),<ref>[[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]. ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', 1:10:4</ref><ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]],'' 3:137; 3:125</ref> and as ''Katourgídōn'' (Κατουργίδων) by [[Ptolemy]] (2nd c. AD).<ref>[[Ptolemy]]. ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis]],'' 3:1:35</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Falileyev|2010}}, s.v. ''Caturiges''.</ref>

The [[ethnonym]] ''Caturiges'' ('kings of combat') stems from the [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] root ''catu''- ('combat, battle') attached to ''riges'' ('kings'; sing. ''rix'').{{sfn|Lambert|1994|p=36}}{{sfn|Delamarre|2003|p=111}}

The city of [[Chorges]], attested as ''Caturrigas'' in the 4th c. AD (''Cadorgas'' in 1062, ''Chaorgias'' in 1338) is named after the tribe.{{sfn|Nègre|1990|p=153}}

== Geography ==
The territory of the Caturiges was located on the upper course of the [[Durance]] river.{{sfn|Graßl|2006}} The Caturiges were initially encompassed in the Roman province of [[Alpes Cottiae]], then in the province of [[Alpes Maritimae]] after the reign of [[Diocletian]] (284–305 CE).{{sfn|Graßl|2006}}

Their capitals were Caturigomagus (modern [[Chorges]]) and Eburodunum (modern [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]]).{{sfn|Graßl|2006}}

== History ==
In the mid-first century BCE, the Caturiges are mentioned by [[Julius Caesar]] as a tribe hostile to Rome.{{sfn|Graßl|2006}}

:''... Here (in the Alps) the [[Ceutrones]] and the [[Graioceli]] and the '''Caturiges''', having taken possession of the higher parts, attempt to obstruct the army in their march. After having routed these in several battles, he arrives in the territories of the [[Vocontii]] in the Further Province on the seventh day from [[Avigliana|Ocelum]], which is the most remote town of the Hither Province; thence he leads his army into the country of the [[Allobroges]], ...''<ref>Caesar, ''Bell. Gall.'' I 10,4</ref>

They were eventually conquered by the Romans under the reign of [[Augustus]].{{sfn|Graßl|2006}}
