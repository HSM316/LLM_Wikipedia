'''Zygmunt Unrug''' (1676–1732), also known as '''Sigismund von Unruh''', was a Polish ''[[szlachta]]'' nobleman of [[German people|German]] descent who served as a royal [[chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]], ''[[starosta]]'', and [[ambassador]] to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] during the period of [[Stanisław I Leszczyński]] and [[Augustus II the Strong]].

Charged with the crime of [[blasphemy]] after some of his purloined private writings were made public by his political enemies, the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Unrug received refuge from Prussia's [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] after being sentenced to death by the Polish-Lithuanian authorities in 1715. Unrug, who, remained committed to clearing his name during his period abroad, was able to secure support from the [[Papacy]] and the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]; a decade later, the original verdict of guilt was finally rejected by the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] of [[Grodno]].<ref name = "Morfill 1890">Morfill, W.

==Biography==
A ''[[szlachta]]'' nobleman by birth, Unrug was born in [[Międzychód]] in 1676, one of the twelve children and six sons of [[Gniezno]] and [[Wałcz]] ''[[starosta]]'' [[Krzysztof Unrug]] (Christoph von Unrug) and his wife Bogumiła Jaskólecka. A [[Protestant]] (member of the [[Bohemian Brethren]]), with German-Polish roots dating back to the 16th century, the privileged Zygmunt Unrug received a Polish education before attending a nearby [[Germany|German]] university at [[Frankfurt on the Oder]], and rose to become a ''starosta'' and a royal [[chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]].

Unrug was notably sent as an ambassador to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]'s [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]], in 1708, shortly before Stanisław's replacement by King [[Augustus II the Strong]].

The well-read and philosophically-inclined Unrug spent a considerable amount of his time poring over the works of various writers and setting down his own ideas privately. Purloined from Unrug's closet, these notes fell into the hands of another nobleman, Andrzej Potocki{{spaced ndash}}a political enemy who had earlier stood opposite Unrug during the earlier conflict between [[Stanisław I Leszczyński]] and [[Augustus II the Strong]].<ref name = "Morfill 1890"/> With Potocki's uproar about allegedly [[blasphemous]] passages in Unrug's collection of notes, the matter quickly became an affair for the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian]] tribunal at [[Piotrków Trybunalski|Piotrków]].

The deliberations carried out at the tribunal returned a verdict confirming Unrug's guilt for the alleged blasphemy. Unrug's insistent protestations of innocence were disregarded; the tribunal ordered the confiscation of Unrug's property (some of it going to Potocki), as well as the burning of the offending notebook{{spaced ndash}}while Unrug himself was sentenced to death by burning after having his tongue torn out and his right hand cut off.<ref name = "Morfill 1890"/><ref name = "Pollard 1892">Pollard, Albert Frederick (1892).

Blackwell; London: Methuen and Co. p. 92.</ref> Unrug's timely escape rendered the full execution of the sentence impossible, as Protestant monarch Frederick William granted Unrug his protection in [[Berlin]].

Unrug remained committed to clearing his name during his period abroad. Already supported by Protestants, he was able to secure support from the highest [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] authority, the [[Papacy|Pope]], who rejected the original ruling on the basis of the incompetence of the court, as well as from the influential scholars at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], who also rejected the Piotrków verdict.<ref name = "Morfill 1890"/> The original sentence was finally rescinded by the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] of [[Grodno]] in 1726, which ordered that the property earlier seized from Unrug be returned to him.<ref name = "Morfill 1890"/>

Zygmunt Unrug died in 1732.

Unrug's life and the nature of his historic blasphemy case was documented by influential Polish writer [[Aleksander Kraushar]] (Alexander Kraushar) in his two-volume ''Sprawa Zygmunta Unruga: epizod historyczny z czasów saskich, 1715-1740'', first published in [[Kraków]] ([[Austrian Poland]]) in 1890.
