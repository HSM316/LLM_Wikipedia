==History and legend==

According to an ancient tradition recorded in ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'', three rivers "burst forth" during the reign of [[Fíachu Labrainne]] as [[High King of Ireland]]. One was ''Innbhear Mainge'' — the Maine. The [[Annals of the Four Masters]] contains the same story, but spells it ''Mand''.

The [[Metrical Dindshenchas]] records ''Inber Cíchmaine, cid cress, gáet co líth-baile láech-bress Maine ergna, úais ella, mac Medba ocus Ailella.'' ("At Inber Cichmaine, though it be narrow, was slain (a mighty onslaught) far-famed Maine, son of [[Medb]] and [[Ailill mac Máta|Ailell]], exulting in fury of warlike combats.")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G106500D/index.html|title=The Metrical Dindshenchas}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T106500D/index.html|title=The Metrical Dindshenchas}}</ref>

A possible etymology is from [[Old Irish]] ''mang'', referring to a fawn or young [[deer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dil.ie/search?q=mang|title = EDIL – Irish Language Dictionary}}</ref>

The Maine was the traditional division of the [[Kingdom of Desmond]]: south of the Maine was controlled by the Gaelic MacCarthys, while north of the Maine was controlled by the Norman [[Earl of Desmond]].

==Course==
The River Maine rises at Tobermaing and flows westwards. It passes through [[Castleisland]] and under the [[N23 road (Ireland)|N23]], then meets its main tributary, the [[Brown Flesk]]. It continues through [[Currans]] and is bridged by the [[N22 road (Ireland)|N22]]. In [[Castlemaine, County Kerry|Castlemaine]] it passes under the [[N70 road (Ireland)|N70]], flows past the [[Ardcanaght Stones]] and enters the harbour.

==Pollution==

In 2014 the river was reported as polluted with [[ammonia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/experts-attempt-to-trace-sources-of-kerry-river-pollution-264608.html|title=Experts attempt to trace sources of Kerry river pollution|date=8 April 2014}}</ref>

==Wildlife==

The River Maine is a noted [[Atlantic salmon|salmon]] and [[sea trout]] fishery. The [[brook lamprey]] also lives in it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lampreysurveys.com/2014/04/10/brook-lamprey/|title=Brook lampreys spawning in the River Maine|work=Lamprey Surveys|date=10 April 2014}}</ref>
