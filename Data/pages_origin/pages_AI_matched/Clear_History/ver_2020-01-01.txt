==Plot==
In 2003, bearded, long-haired Nathan Flomm ([[Larry David]]) is an opinionated, obnoxious business associate of Will Haney ([[Jon Hamm]]), whose company in [[San Jose, California]] is about to introduce a new electric car. Flomm objects to the car being named "the Howard" after Haney’s son, who is himself named after Howard Roark, hero of ''[[The Fountainhead]]''. After Flomm accepts a severance package to cut ties with the company, he becomes a ridiculed public figure when the Howard is a huge success, costing Flomm what would have been his share — a billion dollars.

Ten years later, a balding, clean-shaven Flomm has changed his name to Rolly DaVore and moved to [[Martha's Vineyard]], beginning a new life and making new acquaintances. They include a new best friend (Frank), a now former lover (Wendy), and a local building contractor (Mr. McKenzie).

Frank takes Flomm (a.k.a. Rolly) to a surprise birthday party where he punches Jaspar, the only black person at the party, after a loud welcome by Rolly's friends surprises him. Flomm ruins Jaspar's budding romance with Jennifer ([[Eva Mendes]]), a formerly heavy-set woman, when he advises her to date other men before settling. Jaspar concludes Flomm is a racist. When learning rock band [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] is returning to the Vineyard for the first time in 20 years, Flomm hears a rumor that Wendy had sex with multiple members of the band after that concert. He is upset that everyone seems to know about this but him.

Haney, now a wealthy mogul, arrives on the island with wife Rhonda ([[Kate Hudson]]) and begins building an ostentatious mansion on the site of "Blue Heron," the former Stumpo family home. Flomm is relieved that Haney doesn't recognize him, but can't bear to remain on the island. However, inspired by the movie ''The Fountainhead'', Flomm becomes determined to gain revenge for his lost billion dollars by blowing up Haney's mansion. Frank introduces him to explosives expert Joe Stumpo ([[Michael Keaton]]) and Stumpo's friend Rags ([[Bill Hader]]). He then persuades McKenzie, the construction foreman, to let him be part of the crew.

Stumpo needs a detonator. Flomm meets with Tibor, a Chechen criminal, and pays him $1,000. While driving away, Flomm has a fender-bender with Tibor's new car (a Howard). Tibor demands Flomm pay for the damage. Jaspar discovers Flomm's true identity and warns if Jennifer dates another man he will make Flomm's identity known. Jennifer takes up with Tibor. Flomm worms his way into a close friendship with Haney's wife Rhonda, pretending to know about architecture and engineering. Flomm lies to Tibor that Jennifer had performed oral sex on members of the band Chicago.

Flomm concludes from Rhonda's attentions that she is attracted to him, which will now be his revenge, rather than blowing up the Haneys' new house. During a heated argument over who should move their car, Flomm mistakes her passion and kisses her. Rhonda is repulsed, asking: "Are you crazy?"

Flomm proceeds with the plotted destruction of the house, to occur during Chicago's concert performance, when no one will be home. The band tells Flomm that two of them did indeed receive oral sex from Wendy on their previous visit. Jaspar becomes furious at seeing Jennifer with Tibor and informs the local newspaper of Rolly's true identity. Haney turns up at the concert and shocks Flomm by embracing him, saying he's been trying to locate him for years. He wants to pay Flomm the billion dollars, feeling guilty over their falling out. Flomm is elated, but now must stop Stumpo and Rags from destroying the mansion, which, it turns out, is being built for the benefit of sick and underprivileged children. Flomm arrives too late. The house explodes just as a bus filled with children arrives.

The three end up serving three years in prison. Bearded and shaggy-haired again after his release, Flomm returns to Martha's Vineyard, reunites with Frank and runs into Jennifer, who is overweight again. They decide to go on a date. Flomm, after a haircut and shave, is welcomed back by his poker buddies. One refers to Haney and Rhonda having gone back to California. Wendy has inherited millions of dollars from an elderly woman. The friends thank Flomm for destroying the ugly mansion. They say the Chicago concert was great and that everybody had a great time, including the band, as Flomm learns to his horror, Jennifer ''did'' perform fellatio on band members this time.

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 61% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Its semi-improvised structure finds Larry David squarely in his wheelhouse, but with few laughs and a muddled message, it doesn't live up to his usual standards."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/clear_history/ |title=Clear History (2013)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=July 17, 2018}}</ref> Another review aggregation website [[Metacritic]], which assigns a rating to reviews, gave the film a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/clear-history |title=Clear History Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=August 11, 2013}}</ref>
