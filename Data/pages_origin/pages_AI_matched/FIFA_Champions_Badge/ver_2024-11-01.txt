The '''FIFA Champions Badge''' is a [[Kit (association football)|kit]] emblem in the shape of a gold and white shield, awarded by [[FIFA]] to the reigning world champions of FIFA competitions, both at national team level (e.g. [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], [[FIFA Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]], [[FIFA Futsal World Cup|Futsal World Cup]] and [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup|Beach Soccer World Cup]]) and at club team level (e.g. [[FIFA Club World Cup|Club World Cup]]).

FIFA owns, makes and licenses-out the physical badge, which can only be worn on first-team kits (not on derivative versions, or on training clothing), of the reigning title-holders and is thus a temporary award. FIFA awarded the first badge in February 2008 to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], the then-reigning [[2007 FIFA Club World Cup]] champions.

The badge can be displayed on kits from the day the team becomes FIFA world champions, up to and including the day of the final of the next staging of the competition (e.g. if the team wins the competition again, they can hold the badge uninterrupted).<ref name=LFC2/><ref name=mirror>{{cite news | url= https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/soccer-news/liverpool-wont-wear-golden-badge-21145176 |title= Liverpool won't wear golden badge for winning Club World Cup in Premier League |newspaper=Irish Mirror |date=22 December 2019 | access-date=22 December 2019 | editor=Sports | quote=A FIFA spokesperson said: "As per the usage guidelines, the winning team can wear the FIFA World Champions Badge from the day it becomes champions up to and including the final of the next edition of the tournament."

It will only be permitted on current first-team shirts - not retro shirts or training attire.}}</ref> The badge can only be worn on the club's official first-team kits (both home and away versions) – being the team that won the relevant FIFA world competition – and cannot be worn on any derivative or retrospective form of these kits, or on any related club training clothing, or by the club's reserve teams/any other of the club's teams.<ref name=LFC2>{{cite web | url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/379592-explained-liverpool-earn-gold-fifa-champions-badge | title=Explained: Liverpool earn gold FIFA Champions Badge | author=Glenn Price | date=21 December 2019 | access-date=5 January 2020 | website=Liverpoolfc.com}}</ref><ref name=mirror/>

===Commercial aspects===

The physical badge is manufactured by a third party on behalf of FIFA (by Unisport in 2019),<ref name=USNWT2/> and orders for the physical badge from kit manufacturers must go through FIFA; a logistical situation that created delays in consumers being able to purchase [[Nike Inc.|Nike]]-made kits of the [[United States women's national soccer team]] (USWNT) with the badge in 2019.<ref name=2015ER/><ref name=USNWT2>{{cite web | url=https://www.starsandstripesfc.com/2019/5/15/18555795/ussf-nike-uswnt-world-cup-jersey-sales-problems | title=Show me the merch: what's going on with the USWNT's World Cup jersey sales? | author=Stephanie Yang | date=15 May 2019 | access-date=5 January 2020 | website=Stars and Stripes F.C. | quote=World Cup champion patches are manufactured by Unisport, which adds a layer of logistics obviously, and actually draws FIFA into the mix, as orders reportedly go through them (which makes sense, since it is their brand).}}</ref> There have also been concerns that major kit manufacturers such as Nike and [[Puma (brand)|Puma]], have had issues licensing the FIFA Champions Badge for first-team kits that can be sold to the general public.<ref name=FH>{{cite web | url=https://www.footyheadlines.com/2018/09/nike-certainly-wont-sale-france-2-star-jersey-with-world-cup-winners-badge.html | title=Is Nike Not Allowed To Sale France 2-Star Jersey With World Cup Winners Badge? | website=Footy Headlines | date=9 December 2018 | access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref>

As well as the prestige, the award brings commercial benefits to the recipients through sales of kits that include the new FIFA badge.<ref name=FH/><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/soccer-news/new-balance-set-liverpool-kit-21174050 | title=New Balance set for Liverpool kit boost following Club World Cup despite Nike deal| date=28 December 2019 | access-date=5 January 2020 | newspaper=Irish Mirror | quote=Sports marketing expert Tim Crow wrote on Twitter: "After losing Liverpool’s licensing rights to Nike from next season, this is a big bonus for New Balance in the final few months of their LFC contract. FIFA Champions badge is a big sales driver as Real Madrid has shown."}}</ref>

===Non-FIFA competitions===

A separate agreement is required to wear the badge in a non-FIFA organised competition. For example, in 2009, the [[The Football Association|English FA]] granted [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], the reigning [[2008 FIFA Club World Cup]] holders, permission to wear the badge during [[FA Cup]] fixtures but not in the [[Premier League]],<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/4974806/Manchester-United-world-champions-crest-rebuffed-by-Premier-League.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| title=Manchester United 'world champions' crest rebuffed by Premier League | date=12 March 2009| access-date=21 December 2019 | author=Rory Smith | quote=The Premier League have risked a potential diplomatic row with Fifa by refusing Manchester United permission to wear a crest denoting their status as world champions on their shirts for the rest of the year.}}</ref> and a similar arrangement was sought for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] when they became [[2019 FIFA Club World Cup|2019]] holders,<ref name=lfc/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fifa-champions-badge-rules-17460682|title=Liverpool get gold FIFA Champions badge but it won't be seen on Premier League shirts|author=Sean Bradbury|date=22 December 2019|access-date=22 December 2019|newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]]}}</ref> but they did grant the club the right to use the badge for one home Premier League fixture, against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 29 December 2019 (their first home match after becoming world champions).<ref name=Telegraph.Liverpool>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/12/25/liverpool-granted-permission-wear-gold-badge-one-premier-league/ |title=Exclusive: Liverpool granted permission to wear gold badge for one Premier League game after Club World Cup victory | date=25 December 2019 | access-date=25 December 2019 | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | author= Chris Bascombe | quote=The domestic governing body has accepted an application by the Merseysiders enabling them to celebrate their Club World Cup success with supporters; the home fixture with Wolves on December 29 being the designated date.}}</ref><ref name=LE>{{cite news | url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-confirm-wear-gold-fifa-17481471 |title=Liverpool confirm they will wear Gold FIFA Champions badge against Wolverhampton Wanderers | author=Chris Beesley | access-date=1 January 2020 | date=27 December 2019 | quote=Liverpool are only the second English club to lift the trophy following Manchester United in 2008 but back then the Premier League refused to allow them to sport the badge in their competition. | newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]]}}</ref> In contrast, both [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] were allowed to wear the FIFA Champions Badge on their shirts during all of their Spanish [[La Liga]] fixtures.<ref name=marca/> [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], following their success in 2023, were granted permission by the Premier League to wear the badge for the remainder of the 2023/24 competition.

===Club teams===
The first official award of the badge was made in February 2008 to honour the reigning holders of the [[FIFA Club World Cup]], Italian club [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], who had won the title in 2007.<ref name=FIFA.MILAN>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/fifa-awards-special-club-world-champion-badge-milan-687173|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222151907/https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/fifa-awards-special-club-world-champion-badge-milan-687173|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 December 2019|title=FIFA awards special 'Club World Champion' badge to AC Milan|website=[[FIFA]]|date=2 February 2008|access-date=22 December 2019| quote=At a ceremony today at the Home of FIFA in Zurich, FIFA General Secretary Jerome Valcke officially presented a badge to AC Milan's CEO Adriano Galliani to honour their club's victory at the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup.

===National teams===
In September 2008, the badge was extended to the [[FIFA World Cup]] and was presented to the defending champions from 2006, [[Italy national football team|Italy]], thus becoming the first national team to wear the badge.{{efn|Even though FIFA presented Milan with the first "Champions Badge" seven months earlier in February 2008 as titleholders of the 2007 Club World Cup, because Italy were the reigning champions from the earlier 2006 World Cup, sometimes FIFA refers to Italy as being the "first recipient" of the badge in various press releases.<ref name=FIFA.RM/>}}<ref name="fifa2">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/news/first-fifa-world-champions-badge-presented-italy-868119|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222150939/https://www.fifa.com/news/first-fifa-world-champions-badge-presented-italy-868119|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 December 2019|title=First 'FIFA World Champions Badge' presented to Italy|website=[[FIFA]]|date=2 September 2008|access-date=22 December 2019|quote=FIFA President Joseph S.

{{As of|February 2023}}, the following records apply:

===Continuous periods===
*On 22 December 2019, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] ended [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]]’s uninterrupted reign as FIFA Club World Cup Champions Badge holders that lasted 1,098 days from 18 December 2016; it was noted as the longest ''continuous period'' for which any club team had held a FIFA Champions Badge.<ref name=marca>{{cite news|url= https://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2019/12/04/5de82a5d46163ff45f8b45ed.html | title=Real Madrid give up the world champions badge after 1,098 days | author=Miguel Angel Lara | date = 4 December 2019 | access-date=22 December 2019 | newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]] | quote=On December 18, 2016, Real Madrid were crowned world champions after beating Kashima Antlers and they dethroned previous winners Barcelona. Straight after the final, Adidas launched Madrid's new kit which included the world champions badge. The team officially inaugurated that shirt on January 4, 2017, in a 3-0 Copa del Rey victory against Sevilla and have since played 172 official matches, of which they have won 108 and have scored a total of 392 goals while conceding 200.}}</ref>
*The [[United States women's national soccer team]] won the [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]], and was thus able to keep a FIFA World Cup Champions Badge uninterrupted since 5 July 2015, when they won the [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup|2015 World Cup]] until the end of the [[2023 FIFA Women's World Cup|2023 World Cup]]; this was the longest continuous period for which any national team has held a FIFA Champions Badge (no other national team has yet won the badge twice in succession).

===Most wins===
* For club teams, Real Madrid has won the right to wear the badge on five separate occasions since its inception, while [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] has won the right three times.
* For national football teams, the United States women's team has won the right to wear the badge on two separate occasions since its inception; no men's or other women's football team has won the right more than once.
* For other national teams, the [[Portugal national beach soccer team]] and the [[Russia national beach soccer team]] have won the right twice.
