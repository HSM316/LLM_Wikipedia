The agency's formation was based on Presidential Regulation No. 86 of 2017. It is tasked with improving infrastructure, tourism, and environmental conservation in the area. It coordinates tourism activities across eight regencies in North Sumatra in total: Toba, Simalungun, Samosir, Humbang Hasundutan, North Tapanuli, Dairi, Karo, and Pakpak Bharat; general governance and local issues remain under the control of regional and regency governments. To turn Lake Toba into a top tourism spot, the agency requires a budget of 21 trillion Rupiah (1.3 billion USD). \n\nThe agency is under the oversight of the Lake Toba Authority (ODT), which serves as the overarching management body for the Lake Toba region, overseeing a comprehensive range of responsibilities to facilitate effective management and development. Its duties include strategic planning, policy formulation, and coordination among various stakeholders to ensure the sustainable growth of Lake Toba as a premier tourism destination. \n\nThe BPODT's exercise of authority has faced significant criticism by indigenous communities who raised concerns about being excluded from the development process, viewing the agency's projects as unilateral decisions not taking into account their perspectives or traditions. Lands previously recognized as belonging to indigenous communities have been repurposed under the agency's authority, using Presidential Regulation No. 49 of 2016 as legal basis, leading to land ownership disputes. \n\n References ", "creator": "TheBrowniess", "creation_time": "2024-10-31T03:13:57Z", "word_count": 252, "external_links": ["https://www.seyboldreport.org/article_overview?id=MDYyMDIzMTAyMTI1MzE2NzI0", "https://bkpm.go.id/storage/file/pdf/1683512273.pdf", "https://en.antaranews.com/news/113923/developing-lake-toba-tourism-through-geopark-concept", "https://myl.ejournal.unri.ac.id/index.php/ML/article/view/7923"], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_of_Indonesia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Toba", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sumatra", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_Regency", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simalungun_Regency", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samosir_Regency", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humbang_Hasundutan_Regency", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Tapanuli_Regency", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairi_Regency", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karo_Regency", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakpak_Bharat_Regency"], "external_links_per_word": 0.015873015873015872, "internal_links_per_word": 0.04365079365079365}

{"title": "Joyce Mack", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Mack", "content": "Joyce Mack** (August 17, 1925 – October 11, 2024) was a prominent philanthropist and civic leader known as a \"founding mother\" of Las Vegas. She was instrumental in building the cultural, educational, and civic institutions that helped transform Las Vegas from a casino-centered desert town into a vibrant community with lasting appeal.\n\n Early Life and Move to Las Vegas \nJoyce Jean Rosenberg was born in Los Angeles, California, and attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where she met her future husband, Jerry Mack. The couple married in 1946 and relocated to Las Vegas in 1947 at the urging of Jerry’s father, Nate Mack, who envisioned a growing city in the Nevada desert. Initially hesitant, Joyce soon embraced her new home and shared in Nate's vision for Las Vegas.\n\n Contributions to Las Vegas Development \nJoyce and her husband, Jerry Mack, dedicated themselves to the growth of Las Vegas. Jerry co-founded the Bank of Las Vegas, which became the first bank to provide substantial capital loans to casinos, fueling their expansion and the city's development. While Jerry focused on financial support, Joyce worked to create a sustainable community by supporting cultural, educational, and civic organizations.\n\n Philanthropy and Civic Engagement \nJoyce Mack was deeply involved in philanthropy, helping to establish and fund several local organizations. She supported Planned Parenthood of Southern Nevada and Opportunity Village, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting individuals with intellectual disabilities. Additionally, Joyce laid the foundation for a vibrant arts community by hosting fundraisers for what would eventually become the Las Vegas Museum of Art. Elaine Wynn, co-founder of Mirage Resorts, credited Joyce as a pioneer in establishing Las Vegas's cultural scene.\n\n Legacy with UNLV and Educational Initiatives \nThe Macks' contributions to education are exemplified by their support of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). Jerry was a co-founder of Nevada Southern University, which would later become UNLV, and helped secure over 400 acres for its campus. The Thomas & Mack Center, named in honor of the Macks and their close associates, became the primary venue for UNLV's athletic events. After Jerry’s passing in 1998, Joyce continued their commitment by serving on the UNLV Foundation’s Board of Trustees for 25 years, contributing to educational initiatives and donating significant funds to the law school.\n\n Influence and Recognition \nJoyce Mack was part of a core group of Las Vegas families, including the Macks and Thomases, who worked to build a thriving city by fostering arts, education, and community resources. Her vision and dedication transformed Las Vegas from a tourist destination to a vibrant community with a quality of life that attracted permanent residents. Her refined style and dedication left a lasting impact on the community, solidifying her legacy as one of Las Vegas’s most influential figures.\n\nJoyce Mack’s legacy endures through the institutions and cultural assets she helped establish, ensuring her place in the history of modern Las Vegas.\n\n References \n\nCategory:1925 births\nCategory:2024 deaths\nCategory:American philanthropists\nCategory:People from Las Vegas\nCategory:University of Nevada, Las Vegas", "creator": "Dubnikov", "creation_time": "2024-10-31T02:56:47Z", "word_count": 496, "external_links": [], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_D._Mack", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_D._Mack", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_of_Southern_Nevada", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_Village", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Wynn", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nevada,_Las_Vegas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_&_Mack_Center", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1925_births", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2024_deaths", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:American_philanthropists", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:People_from_Las_Vegas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:University_of_Nevada,_Las_Vegas"], "external_links_per_word": 0.0, "internal_links_per_word": 0.024193548387096774}
