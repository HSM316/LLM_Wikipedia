{"title": "Franco Antonicelli", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Antonicelli", "content": "Franco Antonicelli (15 November 1902 – 6 November 1974) was an Italian author, poet, publisherr, essayist and anti-fascist activist.\n\n Biography \nAntonicelli was born in to the wealthy family of an official from Puglia.  While living in Turin in 1908, he attended the classical high school Massimo d'Azeglio, where he was a student of Umberto Cosmo, and obtained his high school diploma. At the University he graduated first in literature and then, in 1931, thinking of pursuing a diplomatic career, also in law. During his studies he met many exponents of the Turin intellectuals of the time, such as Augusto Monti, Lalla Romano, Leone Ginzburg, Cesare Pavese, Norberto Bobbio, Massimo Mila and Ludovico Geymonat.\n\nOn 31 May 1929 he was arrested for having signed, with other Turin intellectuals, a letter of solidarity with Benedetto Croce. After a month in prison, he was sentenced to three years of confinement but the sentence was commuted to a warning. He then worked as a substitute teacher in the Liceo d'Azeglio and was also Gianni Agnelli's private tutor. From 1932 he was director of the Biblioteca Europea dei libri series of the Frassinelli publisher. By his choice, works by Herman Melville and Franz Kafka, Eugene Gladstone O'Neill and James Joyce, as well as Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, entered Italy for the first time.\n\nHis  association the Turin group of Justice and Freedom gathered in the editorial staff of the magazine Cultura published by Einaudi and which included, among others, Carlo Levi and Cesare Pavese, caused his arrest in May 1935 which occurred following the denunciation by the writer Pitigrilli. On 15 July Antonicelli was sentenced to three years of confinement to be served in Agropoli. During his confinement he married Renata Germano, daughter of the notary Annibale, in whose villa in Sordevolo he often stayed and met his friends. He was freed in March 1936.\n\nIn 1942 he founded the Francesco De Silva publishing house and committed himself, urged by Croce, to the reorganization of the Liberal Party. Immediately after 8 September he moved to Rome where on 6 November he was arrested by the Germans and imprisoned in Regina Coeli. In February 1944 he was transferred to the Castelfranco Emilia prison and was released on 18 April. Returning to Turin, he joined, as a representative of the Liberal Party, the National Liberation Committee of Piedmont, of which he assumed the presidency in 1945 , he directed the edition of the clandestine Risorgimento Liberale - which took the name of the Liberation Opinion - and collaborated on the Risorgimento and Il Patriota newspapers, a publication of the liberal partisan groups operating in Piedmont.\n\nAfter the fall of fascism, in June 1945, he participated in the foundation of the \"Cultural Union\" of Turin, which after his death was named after him. His political idea, in favor of maintaining an agreement with all the anti-fascist forces in the spirit of the CLN, and his republican choice came into conflict with the line of the party,  which supported the monarchy and determined to break the anti-fascist unity. Thus, in April 1946, he left the Liberal Party for the Democratic-Republican Concentration of Ugo La Malfa and Ferruccio Parri, which merged after the referendum of 2 June 1946 into the Republican Party, of which he became one of the leaders at the Naples congress of 1948. The party's choice to ally with the Christian Democrats in the elections of 18 April convinced him to abandon the party.\n\nHe was a founder of the Historical Institute of the Resistance in Piedmont on 25 April 1947 and became its first president. In that year he published If This is a Man, Primo Levi's masterpiece which had been rejected by other publishers, including Einaudi. It was one of the last publications of the Da Silva publishing house, which Antonicelli closed in 1949.\n\nIn this period he collaborated with RAI with the cultural radio program Terza pagina, and with the Turin newspaper La Stampa, with articles on French literature and Italian decadentism.\n\nIn 1953 he joined the National Democratic Alliance, a grouping of liberals and republicans opposed to the political alliance with the Christian Democrats, which fought against the so-called \"scam law\", the electoral law which provided a prize to the list that obtained the majority absolute in the elections, and which was repealed following the defeat of the centrist parties in favor of the law in the June 7 elections. He took a stand against the political and trade union discrimination carried out by Vittorio Valletta's FIAT against communist workers or members of the FIOM and in 1960 he argued that the Tambroni government , elected with the votes of the DC and the MSI , represented a danger for Italian democracy, so more after the demonstrations in multiple cities in which there were also deaths among the demonstrators. Having denounced these facts in a speech in Bologna , Antonicelli was tried for condoning a crime. He was sentenced in the first instance with probation, he was acquitted on appeal.\n\nIn 1968 he was elected to the Senate as an independent on the PCI - PSIUP list for the Alessandria-Tortona constituency. On that occasion, the group of left-wing independents was formed for the first time in Parliament and Antonicelli was a member of the Defense, Public Education and Supervision commissions for radio and television broadcasts. He was re-elected in the 1972 political elections, and took part in the Defense and Radio and Television Supervision commissions.", "revision_time": "2024-03-11T08:39:01Z", "last_edit_time": "2024-10-19", "word_count": 904, "external_links": ["https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/franco-antonicelli_(Dizionario-Biografico)/,%20https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/franco-antonicelli_(Dizionario-Biografico)/", "https://www.anpi.it/biografia/franco-antonicelli", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110116181613/http://www.unioneculturale.org/antonic.htm", "https://books.google.com/books?id=FZf9AQAAQBAJ&newbks=0&hl=en", "https://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/20_novembre_20/figura-franco-antonicelli-libri-televisione-1c1e7854-2b3b-11eb-9939-58d0486c3785.shtml", "https://www.senato.it/legislature/5/composizione/senatori/elenco-alfabetico/scheda-attivita?did=00009703"], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Monti", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalla_Romano", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leone_Ginzburg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Pavese", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norberto_Bobbio", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Mila", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_Geymonat", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedetto_Croce", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Agnelli", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giustizia_e_Libertà", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Levi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Liberal_Party", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Committee", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_La_Malfa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferruccio_Parri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Republican_Party", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_This_Is_a_Man", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primo_Levi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAI", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance_(Italy)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Valletta", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Communist_Party", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Socialist_Party_of_Proletarian_Unity"], "external_links_per_word": 0.00663716814159292, "internal_links_per_word": 0.02654867256637168}
{"title": "Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Geese_Descending_on_the_Sandbank", "content": "Wild geese descending on the sandbank is an ancient Chinese Guqin melody, one of the most notable Guqin pieces together with \"Guangling San\", \"Yangguan San Die\", \"Meihua San Nong\", and others.\n\nIts notation first appeared in a Ming dynasty tablature Ancient Tones Authenticated (古音正宗）compiled by Zhu Changfang. The tranquil and serene piece depicts the scene of wild geese flying and alighting by the water. The Qing dynasty Guqin Notation of Heavenly Sound Pavilion had an introduction: \"Set against the clear autumn sky, the air is crisp and fresh, while the breeze remains calm, as does the sandbank by the water. Amidst clouds stretching for miles, wild geese fly and chant, embodying lofty aspirations akin to those of hermits.\"\n\nThe musical composition commences with a soothing rhythm and delicate harmonics, illustrating the serene expanse of twilight on the autumn river. Subsequently, the melody undergoes a transition into a lively and agile tune, adorned with patterns reminiscent of geese calls, conveying vitality and jubilance. Eventually, it reverts to a harmonious and tranquil melody. The ambiance evokes serenity and ethereality, while simultaneously retaining lively intrigue. The distinctive techniques employed in Guqin performance, including harmonics and glissando, enhance the musical piece, endowing it with a profound artistic allure.\n\n Versions \nThe earliest surviving notation was first printed in the late Ming dynasty tablature Ancient Tones Authenticated by Zhu Changfang. Zhang Dai's Dream Memories of Tao'an stated that Yin Zhixian, the author of \"Huí Yán Mìzhǐ,\" learned this piece from Wang Benwu in Shaoxing towards the end of the Wanli era. Subsequently, around fifty Guqin notation collections included different schools and versions of the piece. The authorship of these pieces also varied among collections, including poet Chen Zi'ang from the Tang dynasty, Mao Zhongmin and Tian Zhiweng from the Song dynasty, and Zhu Quan from the Ming dynasty.\n\n Modern adaptions and recordings \n \"Jiao'an Guqin score\" version, consisting of seven sections, represents the Guangling school, with recordings by Liu Shaochun, Zhang Ziqian, and others。\n \"Qinxue Series\" version, also with seven sections, commonly known as \"North Sandbank,\" represented by Guan Pinghu's recordings.\n The Pei Jieqing transmitted score, also known as \"Chuan School Sandbank\" or \"South Sandbank,\" can be found in the \"Yinyinshi Qin Score\" written by Hong Kong qin player Cai Deyun. \n \"Mei'an Guqin Score\" version, representing the Meian school, adds a section describing the calls of geese and the circling of the flock, vividly and distinctly, under the composition of Wang Yanqing.\n The Wu Jixi transmitted score, representing the Min school, is the version played by Chen Changlin.\n Versions by Wu Lansun and Wu Zhaoji, included in the \"Wu School Qin Score.\" \n\n Reference \n\n External Links \n\n ，《蕉庵琴譜》本，劉少椿演奏\n ，《蕉庵琴譜》本，林友仁演奏\n ，《梅庵琴譜》本，楊秋悅演奏\n ，裴介卿傳譜本，沈草農演奏\n ，《琴學叢書》本，孫貴生演奏\n ，《指法匯參確解》，林晨演奏\n ，《琴學叢書》本，楊葆元演奏\nCategory:Songs about birds", "revision_time": "2024-03-16T23:57:20Z", "last_edit_time": "2024-04-21", "word_count": 445, "external_links": [], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangguan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin_notation", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Changfang", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Dai", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Memories_of_Tao’an", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaoxing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanli_Emperor", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Zi'ang", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/蕉庵琴譜", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Shaochun", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Youren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/梅庵琴譜", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Qiuyue", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/沈草農", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/琴學叢書", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Guisheng", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/指法匯參確解", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Chen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/琴學叢書", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/楊葆元", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Songs_about_birds"], "external_links_per_word": 0.0, "internal_links_per_word": 0.056179775280898875}

The regional board is supported by the municipal councils, whose task is to promote and participate in the preparation of issues in the municipalities. Issues are prepared in regional working groups such as land use and housing, transport, social services and infrastructure services. \n\nMunicipalities\n\nCoat ofarms Municipality Population Land area(km2) Density(/km2) Finnishspeakers Swedishspeakers Otherspeakers50px|border|Coat of arms of Kangasala Kangasala        %   %   %50px|border|Coat of arms of Lempäälä Lempäälä        %   %   %50px|border|Coat of arms of Nokia Nokia         %   %   %50px|border|Coat of arms of Orivesi Orivesi         %   %   %50px|border|Coat of arms of Pirkkala Pirkkala         %   %   %50px|border|Coat of arms of Tampere Tampere         %   %   %50px|border|Coat of arms of Vesilahti Vesilahti         %   %   %50px|border|Coat of arms of Ylöjärvi Ylöjärvi         %   %   % Total         %  %  %\n\n See also \n Greater Helsinki\n Turku metropolitan area\n\n References \n\n \nTampere\nCategory:Geography of Pirkanmaa", "revision_time": "2024-03-26T08:00:24Z", "last_edit_time": "2024-09-20", "word_count": 490, "external_links": ["https://tampereenseutu.fi/|Tampereen", "https://tampereenseutu.fi/", "https://www.nysse.fi/en/tickets-and-fares/zones.html", "https://www.tampereenvesi.fi/"], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Finland", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirkanmaa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-regions_of_Finland", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampere_sub-region", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampere", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampere", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangasala", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempäälä", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia,_Finland", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orivesi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirkkala", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesilahti", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ylöjärvi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirkanmaa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Helsinki", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampere_sub-region", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hämeenkyrö", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhmoinen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pälkäne", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commuting", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transport", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nysse", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkeakoski", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Economic_Development,_Transport_and_the_Environment", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_industry", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampere_Water", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kangasala.vaakuna.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangasala", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lempäälä.vaakuna.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempäälä", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nokia.vaakuna.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia,_Finland", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Orivesi.vaakuna.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orivesi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pirkkala.vaakuna.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirkkala", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tampere.vaakuna.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampere", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vesilahti.vaakuna.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesilahti", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ylöjärvi.vaakuna.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ylöjärvi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Helsinki", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turku_metropolitan_area", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Tampere_metropolitan_area", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Metropolitan_areas_of_Finland", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Pirkanmaa"], "external_links_per_word": 0.00816326530612245, "internal_links_per_word": 0.10204081632653061}
{"title": "Colored Symmetry (book)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colored_Symmetry_(book)", "content": " Colored Symmetry is a book by A.V. Shubnikov and N.V. Belov and published by Pergamon Press in 1964. The book contains translations of materials originally written in Russian and published between 1951 and 1958. The book was notable because it gave English-language speakers access to new work in the fields of  dichromatic and polychromatic symmetry.\n\nStructure and topics\nThe book is divided into two parts. The first part is a translation into English of A.V. Shubnikov's book Symmetry and antisymmetry of finite figures (Russian: Симметрия и антисимметрия конечных фигур) originally published in 1951. As the editor says in his preface, this book rekindled interest in the field of antisymmetry after a break of 20 years.  The book defines symmetry elements, operations and groups; it then introduces the concept of antisymmetry, and derives the full set of dichromatic three-dimensional point groups. A paper entitled Antisymmetry of textures is appended to part 1; it analyzes the antisymmetry of groups containing infinity-fold axes.\n\nThe second part, entitled Infinite groups of colored symmetry, consists of translations of six papers by N.V. Belov and his co-workers in the new field of polychromatic symmetry. These papers cover the derivation of the 42 magnetic Bravais lattices and the 1651 magnetic space groups, the 46 dichromatic plane groups, mosaics for the 46 dichromatic plane groups, one-dimensional infinite crystallographic groups, polychromatic plane groups, and three-dimensional mosaics with colored symmetry.\n\nAudience\n\nThe book is written for crystallographers, mathematicians and physics researchers who are interested in the application of color symmetry to crystal structure analysis and physics experiments involving magnetic or ferroelectric materials.\n\nReception\nThe book had a mixed reception from reviewers. Allen Nussbaum in American Scientist praised the editor for constructing a consistent story from the original works, but criticised the papers in part two for being difficult to read. G.S. Pawley in a review for Science Progress gave credit to the editor for adding the international notation next to the authors' \"retrograde personal notation\". However, he criticised claims that the book is a \"valuable reference book\" as being \"optimistic\". Martin Buerger in an extensive review for Science also offered both praise and criticism. He stated that previous work in the field by William Barlow and H.J. Woods is not given sufficient credit by the authors and is largely missing from the, otherwise full, bibliography.  He praised Shubnikov's book (part 1) as being \"very clearly written, well illustrated, and easy to understand\", but criticised Belov's papers in part 2 because they \"lack a central unifying theme.\" R.J. Davis in a brief review in Mineralogical Magazine said \"this book is therefore unique in English and forms an essential introduction to modern developments in symmetry theory.\" \nInfluence\n\nIn later reviews of the literature by R.L.E. Schwarzenberger and by Branko Grünbaum and G.C. Shephard in their book Tilings and patterns the work of the Russian color symmetry school led by A.V. Shubnikov and N.V. Belov was put into its proper historical context. Schwarzenberger, and Grünbaum and Shephard, give credit to Shubnikov and Belov for relaunching the field of color symmetry after the work of Heinrich Heesch and H.J. Woods in the 1930s was largely ignored. However, they criticise Shubnikov and Belov for taking a crystallographic rather than a group-theoretic approach, and for using their own confusing notation rather than adopting the international standard Hermann–Mauguin notation for crystallographic symmetry elements.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n '' at the Internet Archive\n\nCategory:Mathematics books\nCategory:1964 non-fiction books\nCategory:Symmetry", "revision_time": "2024-03-31T22:28:58Z", "last_edit_time": "2024-04-16", "word_count": 557, "external_links": ["https://archive.org/details/coloredsymmetry0000avsh/page/n5/mode/2up", "https://zbmath.org/0132.23302", "https://rruff.info/doclib/MinMag/Volume_35/35-270-441.pdf", "https://www.persee.fr/doc/bulmi_0037-9328_1964_num_87_3_5765_t1_0467_0000_5", "https://archive.org/details/isbn_0716711931/page/462/mode/2up", "https://archive.org/details/coloredsymmetry0000avsh|title=Colored"], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Vasilievich_Shubnikov", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Belov_(geochemist)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichromatic_symmetry", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polychromatic_symmetry", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pergamon_Press", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Vasilievich_Shubnikov", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Belov_(geochemist)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pergamon_Press", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichromatic_symmetry", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polychromatic_symmetry", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichromatic_symmetry", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_space_group#Magnetic_point_groups", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallografija", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zbMATH_Open", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_space_group#Black-white_Bravais_lattices", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magnetic_space_group", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crystal_structure", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferroelectricity", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Scientist", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Scientist", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Julian_Buerger", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(journal)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barlow_(geologist)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(journal)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolph_Ludwig_Edward_Schwarzenberger", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Mathematical_Society#Publications", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branko_Grünbaum", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Colin_Shephard", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilings_and_patterns", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Heesch", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann–Mauguin_notation", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mathematics_books", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1964_non-fiction_books", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Symmetry"], "external_links_per_word": 0.010771992818671455, "internal_links_per_word": 0.06463195691202872}

The day after the 100 m final, she competed in the long jump, jumping personal best of 5.86 m to take third.\n\nThe following year, Leduc represented Canada at the 2019 NACAC U23 Championships in Querétaro, Mexico. Competing in the 100 m, she set a personal best of 11.54 in the heats, before improving on the that time with a clocking of 11.52 with an illegal +3.3 m/s wind. She also competed as part of the Canadian 4 × 100 m relay team, taking a silver medal alongside Shyvonne Roxborough, Ashlan Best, and Natassha McDonald. \n\n Laval Rouge et Or \n2020 marked Leduc's first year competing as part of the Laval Rouge et Or track and field team. Competing in her first USPORTS Championships in March, she won bronze in the 60 m, silver in the 4 × 200 m, and a bronze in the long jump.\n\nAt the 2022 USPORTS Championships, she took bronze in 60 m, repeating her showing from the 2020 edition, took fifth in the long jump, and won gold anchoring the Laval women to 4 × 200 m gold. Later that year, representing Quebec at the Canada Summer Games in the Niagara Region, she three gold medals in the 100 m, 200 m, and 4 × 100 m.\n\nIn 2023, Leduc won her first USPORTS individual title, winning the long jump in a personal best of 6.11. That same weekend she would also take a bronze in the 4 × 200 m and fifth in the 60 m. In July, she placed fourth at the Canadian Track and Field Championships in the 100 m.\n\n 2024: Breakthrough year \n2024 marked a breakthrough year for Leduc. In March, she represented Canada at the World Indoor Championships in Glasgow, Scotland. Competing in  the 60 m, she tied her personal best of 7.22 in the first round, advancing her to the semi-finals. In the semis, she ran another personal best of 7.21, but didn't advance to the final. Later that month, at the USPORTS Championships, she won gold in the 60 m and led the Laval women's 4 × 200 m team to a silver medal.\n\nOn March 30, Leduc opened her 2024 outdoor season at the Florida Relays in Gainesville, Florida. Competing in the 100 m, she ran a massive personal best of 11.08, eclipsing her previous best by 0.30 seconds and breaking the 36-year-old Quebec record of 11.13.\n\nOn April 20, competing at Louisiana State University, Leduc set another 100 m personal best of 10.96. With her time, Leduc broke Angela Bailey's Canadian national record of 10.98, set in 1987. Her time was also under the Paris Olympic qualifying standard of 11.07, qualifying her for the 2024 Summer Olympics in August.\n\n Championship results \n+Representing  and

The Dyngjufjöll is a volcanic mountain range in the northeast of Iceland which belongs to the Askja volcanic system. Sometimes called Dyngjufjöll, it is part of the Vatnajökull National Park. The Askja caldera is also located there.\n\nLocation \nThe huge mountain massif is located in the highlands of Iceland , more precisely in the Ódáðahraun and covers around 600 km². It forms an almost perfect square with a side length of around 24 km.\n\nVatnajökull with its Dyngjujökull glacier tongue is 15 km south of the mountains.\n\nOn the west side, the Dyngjudalur valley cuts into the mountains, so that this is called the Vestari-Dyngjufjöll . These also include the central volcano of the Askja volcanic system.\n\nGeography\nthumb|250px|Öskjuvatn caldera\nMany peaks in Dyngjufjöll reach between 1,300 and 1,500 m and thus rise above the bottom of the Askja Caldera by around 100 - 300 m.\n\nThe highest peak is Þorvaldstindur with a height of 1,510 m. It is named after an Icelandic geologist, Þorvaldur Thoroddsen.Íslandshandbókin. Náttúra, saga og sérkenni 2.bindi. Hg. T. Einarsson, H. Magnússon. 1989, S. 915.\n\nThis is the central volcano of an approximately 150 km long fissure system, which is also called Askja after its main caldera. Ari Trausti Guðmundsson: Lebende Erde. Facetten der Geologie Islands. Reykjavík 2007, S. 198.\n\nThe mountains are mostly made of palagonite . They appear to be the remains of a large Ice Age stratovolcano. But since then the volcano has continued to work steadily, so that thick layers of lava and ash cover the palagonite in most places.\n\nOne of the passes between the peaks, Jónsskarð, is ​​also named after an Icelandic geologist, Jón Þorkelsson, who was the first to describe the Askja volcano. He examined it after the great eruption of 1875. The lowest pass between these mountains, which also form the edge of the Askja caldera, is the Öskjuop.\n\nHere the caldera opens to the east and a hiking trail leads through it to Lake Öskjuvatn.Íslandshandbókin. Náttúra, saga og sérkenni 2.bindi. Hg. T. Einarsson, H. Magnússon. 1989, S. 915. Two German researchers, Max Rudloff and Walther von Knebel, who disappeared in the area around this time, probably drowned in this in 1907 . Knebel's fiancée, Ina von Grumbkow, organized an unsuccessful search expedition the next year, in which she also took part.vgl. z. B. http://isafold.de/klassiker/grumbkow/default.htm, abgerufen am 25. Oktober 2010\n\nDrekagil Gorge\nAlso to the east of it is a gorge called the Drachenschlucht (Isl. Drekagil). There is a Dreki hut belonging to the Akureyri hiking club. This hiking club also runs the Dyngjufjöll hut, which is located north-northwest of the Askja..\n\nSee also\n List of volcanic eruptions in Iceland\n\nReferences", "revision_time": "2024-04-25T09:42:56Z", "last_edit_time": "2024-07-05", "word_count": 434, "external_links": ["http://isafold.de/klassiker/grumbkow/default.htm,", "http://www.ffa.is/en/huts|titel"], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Viti_geothermal_lake_at_Askja.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatnajökull_National_Park", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:138_OESKJUVATN.JPG", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_volcanic_eruptions_in_Iceland"], "external_links_per_word": 0.004608294930875576, "internal_links_per_word": 0.009216589861751152}

{"title": "Saturn Electrostatic Discharges", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Electrostatic_Discharges", "content": "Saturn Electrostatic Discharges (also referred to as SEDs) are atmospheric lightning events in convective weather storms on Saturn that produce high frequency (HF) radio emissions (1-40 MHz). Terrestrial lighting events on Earth, in comparison, occur in the very low frequency (VLF) radio band, between 3 Hz and 30 kHz. This makes SED signals at least 10,000 times stronger. While first discovered by NASA's Voyager 1 mission, the scientific community has gained further understanding through the following Voyager 2 and Cassini missions in conjunction with ground-based observation and data gathering methods.\n\n Voyager \nSaturn Electrostatic discharges were first recorded by the Voyager 1 mission as it passed near Saturn in November 1980. The term was subsequently coined by Warwick et al. in April 1981 in the Journal Planetary Radio Astronomy Observations from Voyager 1 Near Saturn. It was initially uncertain whether these SEDs were associated with storms in the planet's atmosphere or if they were originating in its rings. Evans et al. hypothesized that they originated from a satellite located within Saturn's B Ring, which was also the proposed reason for a narrow feature also found. This was disputed in 1983 by Kaiser et al., who argued that the occultation caused by the planet lasted too long for SEDs to originate in the rings.\n\n Cassini \nWhen the Cassini mission reached Saturn in 2004, SEDs and optical storm observations were finally directly linked. This occurred when Cassini ISS imaged the Dragon Storm, which was located by the SEDs it produced and then optically verified. It and other white storm clouds were found to be brighter in conjunction with higher rates of SEDs. The Dragon Storm can range over 2,000 miles and is located at a planetocentric latitude of 35° south. This planet region is called \"storm alley\" as all storm activity on Saturn was concentrated here in a 1.5° band from 2002 to 2010.\n\nDuring the Cassini mission, it was also discovered that SEDs could be detected over the horizon. This phenomenon, known as over-the-horizon events, was made possible by the previously mentioned combination of radio and optical observations. It is theorized that this occurs when SED radio waves are temporarily trapped under Saturn's ionosphere.\n\n Ground Based Observations \nThe first reliable ground-based detections of SEDs occurred in Ukraine in January/February 2006. At this time, SED storm E lasted approximately one month. The ground team used the UTR-2 radio telescope, and the data was combined with real-time information from Cassini. These efforts were made easier by the high intensity of the SEDs occurring during the month-long SED storm E. The process was repeated in November 2007 during the eight-month-long storm F and produced a high degree of coincidence between the UTR-2 and Cassini.\n\nAt this same time as storm E, amateur astronomers became engaged in observing Saturn's storms. Storm E, observed by Cassini, was the first long-lasting SED storm while Saturn was distant from solar conjunction, making it high in the sky for ground-based observers. In the images captured by amateurs, the SED storms proved easily detectable, manifesting as bright white spots.\n\n References \n\nCategory:Planetary atmospheres of the Solar System\nCategory:Saturn", "revision_time": "2024-05-13T05:41:56Z", "last_edit_time": "2024-08-19", "word_count": 513, "external_links": ["https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.212.4491.239", "https://www.nature.com/articles/299236a0", "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13294", "https://www.nature.com/articles/303050a0", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103507001613", "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2007JA012592", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003206331100242X"], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lightning", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_frequency", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/very_low_frequency", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Storm_(astronomy)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_T-shaped_Radio_telescope,_second_modification", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_conjunction", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Planetary_atmospheres_of_the_Solar_System", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Saturn"], "external_links_per_word": 0.01364522417153996, "internal_links_per_word": 0.031189083820662766}
{"title": "Marie Balmary", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Balmary", "content": "Marie Balmary, born about 1939, is a French psychoanalyst and essayist . In addition to her therapeutic practice, she studies the Bible and Greek mythology with groups of scholars using psychoanalytic theory and, in return, questioning its foundations.\n\n Academic career \nMary Balmary is a clinical psychologist with university training, a psychoanalyst with Lacanian training and a researcher..\n\nHer doctoral thesis devoted to the relationship between Freudian theory and Freud 's family history having been refused before defense; she published it in 1979 under the title L'Homme aux statues: Freud et la faute cachée du père, or The Man with Statues: Freud and the hidden fault of the father . In this work, she revisits Freudian theory based on a reading of the myth of Oedipus, which includes the story of Oedipus' father and the etymological consideration of the words and names of these stories and a study of their relationship with the history of Freud's family..\n\nAfter the publication of her thesis, Balmary began reading the Bible. When she approached the Biblical origin myth, which she considered to be the book of Genesis, she followed the Biblical reading seminar of the Jesuit exegete Paul Beauchamp . for three years in the early 1980s, and became close from him.\n\nIn her reading, she mobilized psychoanalytic concepts to understand and interpret the founding biblical texts.. She paids very close attention to the letter of these texts, in their original languages, Hebrew, Aramaic and biblical Greek, which she learned, and considered any apparent strangeness or \"mistakes\" of the text, including grammatical errors, as being able to carry meaning.\n\nHer close reading led to new understandings and re-interpretations.\n\nExamples :\n\n In The Forbidden Sacrifice, she notes that it is Abraham who attributes to God an order (that of sacrificing his son Isaac), though is not explicitly written that he gave it;\n in The Divine Origin, she proposes that the prohibition of the Garden of Eden relates to the confusing of the masculine and the feminine, of man and woman not understanding the other well, and of assimilating it to oneself instead of accepting it as it is. 'he is.\n She also disputes the translation of a sentence ( « You will give birth in pain » ) that God addresses to Eve . A more appropriate translation would be « In sorrow you will give birth to sons \", which would thus refer to « the difficulty for human beings to let their own life, their own words happen in others and particularly the child ».\n\n Publications \n\n Works \n\n 1979 : , Le Livre de Poche Biblio Essais n° 4201 – 1994.\n 1986 : , Le Livre de Poche Biblio Essais n° 4220 – 07/11/1995 - ( Nicolas Missarel Prize in 1987),...\n 1993 : The divine origin.

He had previously served within the Illinois Army National Guard as the Chief of Staff until 2018. \n\nMilitary Career\nEric Little joined the Illinois Army National Guard in 1989 and received his commission as a Second Lieutenant in August, 1992. He served as a quartermaster officer and deployed both in support of the Iraq War and Afghan War. In December 2012 he took command of the 65th Troop Command Brigade as a Colonel From there he served two different stints as the Illinois Army National Guard Chief of Staff before departing for the National Guard Bureau as the Deputy Director, J-8/Programs in 2018. In 2020 he became the Director, Manpower and Personnel at the National Guard Bureau. This job entailed leading the National Guard's Sexual Assault and Harassment Response and Equal Opportunity programs.  \n\nFiring\nIn August of 2023, Major General Little was fired from his potion as the Director, Manpower and Personnel after the Inspector General substantiated complaints of sexist comments and counterproductive leadership. The investigation found a \"toxic cacophony of misconduct\" dating back several years to his previous assignments. The original substantiated complaints dated from prior to his promotion to Major General and amounted to \"frat-house behavior\" while causing enough concern that another separate investigation was opened up looking into Little's behavior.  \n\nSome raised questions as to how Little had become the top personnel officer for the Army National Guard despite never attending any human resources professional military education.

{"title": "NAFI Stuttgart", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAFI_Stuttgart", "content": "NAFI Stuttgart (stylized as N.A.F.I. Stuttgart) is a German futsal and football club from Stuttgart. The futsal team won the DFB-Futsal-Cup, the German futsal championship, once. As of September 2022, the club is currently not fielding any teams.N.A.F.I. Stuttgart e. V. In: fussball.de, accessed on September 1, 2022\n\n History \nThe club originated from an amateur team that was founded around 2005. Five years later, the team joined the Türk SC Stuttgart. After this club dissolved, the team continued to play as Hilalspor Stuttgart. In 2013, the club was renamed to NAFI Stuttgart. As the Württemberg Football Association believed that NAFI was a family name and therefore not allowed as a club name, periods were inserted between the letters. According to the club president, NAFI stands for Neuer Amateurfußball international (New international amateur football). However, the club's website states that the name derives from the sponsor Nafis Bakirci.\n\n Futsal \nUnder the name TSC Stuttgart, the team first qualified for the DFB-Futsal-Cup in 2008 and became German futsal vice champions after a 3:6 defeat in the final against UFC Münster. After being eliminated prematurely in 2009, 2012 and 2013, the club won the German championship in 2014. After defeating Hamburg Panthers and UFC Münster, the Stuttgart team reached the final again, where they beat Holzpfosten Schwerte 5:3. The following year, Schwerte took revenge with a 10:4 victory in the semifinals. For unknown reasons, Stuttgart did not participate in the newly introduced Regionalliga Süd in 2015 and instead played in the second division.\n\n Football \nNAFI Stuttgart was also active in football. The first team was promoted to the Bezirksliga Stuttgart in 2015 and to the Landesliga in 2017. At the winter break of the 2018/19 season, NAFI was in second place in the Landesliga, but due to unpaid wages and internal disputes within the club,teckbote.de: Nafi Stuttgart droht der Zerfall (8. April 2019), accessed on July 6, 2019 the team only finished eleventh in the table at the end of the season. For the 2019/20 season, the club did not register a team and was therefore placed last in the final Landesliga table of the 2018/19 season.remszeitung.de: N.A.F.I.

The Ship Cafe was built at the same time, and was originally intended to be a full-service resort \"with sleeping apartments, a restaurant, a kitchen, office and all of the appointments of the modern hotel\".\n\nThe Venice Auditorium performance venue at the end of the pier had 3,600 seats. The Venice Plunge indoor saltwater swimming pool, which  was located around the corner on Ocean Front Walk, had 1,500 dressing rooms at opening.\n\nthumb|Crowd on Venice Amusement Pier \n\nThe Venice Aquarium was a double-duty tourist attraction and marine mammal research facility. Along the boardwalk of the pier were approximately 40 concessions and rides including the Ocean Inn, pool hall, bowling alley, merry-go-round, the \"Joy Wheel,\" the Whip, the Virginia Reel, the Over the Falls, the Captive Aeroplanes, a \"pigsty slide with a large number of small animals,\" the Longworthy fish market, The Steeplechase, Hilarity Hall, a seaplane ride, glassblowers, a Ferris wheel, a shooting gallery, the \"Old Mill,\" the Dipper, and Stimpson's candy shop. The pier had an automobile parking garage as of 1920.\n\nThe pier was damaged by storms on multiple occasions, the two most notable being the nearly finished pier being wrecked by high waves and wind prior to the 1905 opening, and the New Year's Day 1914 storm that caused $100,000 in damages.\n\n 1920 pier fire \n\nThe Venice Pier caught fire on December 20, 1920, just a month after the death of its developer, Abbot Kinney. The fire was first discovered in the dance hall; as the fire rose around them, the band played a rousing march to rally the guests through an orderly evacuation. The dance hall was located on the north side of the pier, about  west of the water line.\n\nFirefighter Arthur Harlan was killed with the wall of the Ocean Inn collapsed on top of him.\n\n Additional images \n\n See also \n Venice Short Line\n Venice Miniature Railway\n Venice Fishing Pier\n\n References \n\n Sources \n\n \n \n \n\nCategory:1905 establishments in California\nCategory:1920 disestablishments in California\nCategory:Piers in Los Angeles County, California\nCategory:Venice, Los Angeles\nCategory:Defunct amusement parks in California\nCategory:Tourist attractions in Los Angeles County, California", "revision_time": "2024-06-09T22:57:25Z", "last_edit_time": "2024-06-09", "word_count": 408, "external_links": ["https://www.newspapers.com/image/2959967/", "https://www.newspapers.com/article/evening-vanguard-venice-leads-nation-in/148463471/", "https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-los-angeles-times-million-dollar-los/148417656/", "https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-sacramento-bee-venice-pier-loss-amou/148479287/", "https://www.newspapers.com/article/news-pilot-venice-pier-is-razed-by-fire/148479529/"], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Foote_Marsh", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbot_Kinney", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice,_Los_Angeles", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbot_Kinney", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_Cafe_(Venice,_California)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Crowd_on_Venice_Amusement_Pier_c_1910_cropped_and_brightened_-_USC_digital_-_Los_Angeles_Examiner_photos.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Short_Line", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Miniature_Railway", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Fishing_Pier", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Architectural_Record", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1905_establishments_in_California", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1920_disestablishments_in_California", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Piers_in_Los_Angeles_County,_California", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Venice,_Los_Angeles", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Defunct_amusement_parks_in_California", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Tourist_attractions_in_Los_Angeles_County,_California"], "external_links_per_word": 0.012254901960784314, "internal_links_per_word": 0.04411764705882353}
{"title": "Parengyodontium album", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parengyodontium_album", "content": "Parengyodontium album is a globally distributed fungal species known for breaking down plastics but also items of cultural heritage. Recent discoveries have revealed its presence in marine ecosystems, specifically in its ability to colonize and break down polyethylene (PE), the most abundant plastic in oceanic debris. Marine microbiologists from the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) and collaborators from various international institutions found that P. album, along with other marine microbes, lives in thin biofilms on plastic litter scattered across the ocean. The fungus is one of only a handful of marine fungi known to degrade plastic, a group that remains relatively small compared to the number of bacteria with similar capabilities.\n\nBreakdown of ocean plastics\n\nThe degradation of PE by Parengyodontium album is particularly notable because it occurs at a rate of about 0.05 percent per day under laboratory conditions, and this process is significantly influenced by sunlight. Researchers noted that the fungus only breaks down PE that has been exposed to UV light, indicating that in natural settings, P. album likely affects plastics floating near the ocean surface. While the fungus converts most of the carbon from PE into carbon dioxide, the environmental impact of this CO2 release is minimal, akin to the amount exhaled by humans during breathing. However, the potential for P. album and possibly other yet-to-be-discovered marine fungi to contribute to the degradation of plastics in deeper ocean layers remains an area ripe for further research, especially given the vast amounts of plastic waste that accumulate in the world's oceans each year.\n\nReferences", "revision_time": "2024-06-14T20:40:19Z", "last_edit_time": "2024-10-29", "word_count": 256, "external_links": ["https://www.nioz.nl/en/news/fungus-breaks-down-ocean-plastic", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1749461320300245", "https://www.newscientist.com/article/2435037-marine-fungus-can-break-down-floating-plastic-pollution/", "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240603114314.htm", "https://www.salon.com/2024/06/06/scientists-discover-ocean-fungus-that-eats-plastic/"], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polyethylene", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microbes"], "external_links_per_word": 0.01953125, "internal_links_per_word": 0.0078125}

He was elected to the Assembly of Extremadura and appointed to the Senate in 2023.\n\nBiography\nBorn in Mérida in Extremadura, Gordillo became the director and manager of an agricultural company. As of 2019, he had never married or had children.\n\nAs a member of the People's Party (PP) from 1990 to 2018, he was a member of the city council and deputy mayor. He was chosen as Vox's candidate for mayor of Mérida in the 2019 Spanish local elections, and his party took two seats on the council.\n\nGordillo was chosen as Vox's candidate for President of the Regional Government of Extremadura in the 2023 Extremaduran regional election. Vox entered the Assembly of Extremadura with five seats, which would allow it to form a majority government with the PP. Negotiations between the two parties stalled, allowing the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) to install its candidate for President of the Assembly, the role of speaker. PP leader María Guardiola went back on her word and formed a government with Vox, giving Gordillo's party control of the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nAs part of the coalition agreement, Gordillo was designated a seat in the Senate of Spain. He maintained his seat in the regional assembly.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1962 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:People from Mérida, Spain\nCategory:People's Party (Spain) politicians\nCategory:Vox (political party) politicians\nCategory:Members of the 11th Assembly of Extremadura\nCategory:Members of the 15th Senate of Spain", "revision_time": "2024-06-29T19:26:04Z", "last_edit_time": "2024-10-18", "word_count": 236, "external_links": ["https://www.hoy.es/elecciones/autonomicas-municipales/angel-pelayo-gordillo-20190423004338-ntvo.html", "https://www.extremadura7dias.com/index.php/noticia/un-exconcejal-del-pp-candidato-de-vox-a-la-alcaldia-de-merida", "https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/3621103/0/exconcejal-pp-angel-pelayo-gordillo-candidato-vox-alcaldia-merida/", "https://www.eldiario.es/extremadura/politica/recuento-concejal-vox-merida-psoe_1_5953953.html", "https://www.ondacero.es/emisoras/extremadura/noticias/angel-pelayo-gordillo-candidato-vox-presidencia-junta-extremadura_2023052064678073277db70001632d80.html", "https://www.publico.es/politica/psoe-presidira-asamblea-extremadura-fracaso-negociaciones-pp-vox.html", "https://www.elmundo.es/elecciones/2023/06/30/649e788cfdddff01528b45c7.html", "https://www.hoy.es/extremadura/fernandez-vara-senador-designacion-asamblea-extremadura-20230718135119-nt.html", "https://www.hoy.es/extremadura/pelayo-gordillo-mantendra-escano-asamblea-senador-20230719140726-nt.html"], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ángel_Pelayo_2023_(cropped).jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoy_(Extremadura)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(political_party)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_Extremadura", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_(Spain)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mérida,_Extremadura", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremadura", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Party_(Spain)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_minutos", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Press", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(political_party)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Spanish_local_elections", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elDiario.es", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Regional_Government_of_Extremadura", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Extremaduran_regional_election", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onda_Cero", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_Extremadura", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Socialist_Workers'_Party", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Público_(Spain)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/María_Guardiola", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mundo_(Spain)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_(Spain)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1962_births", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Living_people", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:People_from_Mérida,_Spain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:People's_Party_(Spain)_politicians", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Vox_(political_party)_politicians", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_11th_Assembly_of_Extremadura", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_15th_Senate_of_Spain"], "external_links_per_word": 0.038135593220338986, "internal_links_per_word": 0.1271186440677966}

{"title": "Rádio 94FM", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A1dio_94FM", "content": "Rádio 94FM was a Portuguese CHR-formatted local radio station broadcasting from the city of Leiria. It operated between 1985 and 12 July 2024, after which the station was bought by Observador becoming a relayer of Rádio Observador.\nHistory\nThe station's origins date back to the late summer period of 1985, when Joaquim Rodrigues, Agostinho Peçanha, Luís Perdigão, Mª Isabel Vicente and Victor Manuel Marques founded Rádio Comercial de Leiria. Like many local radio stations of the time, RCL was a pirate station, having been granted a regular license in 1989. The station promoted pop music in the 90s, in order to achieve a wider public, aside from its carriage of local and regional news.\n\nNew management took over the station in August 1997, adopting Rádio 9FM as its name, and changing the format. Accolades during the initial year of the reformat included competitions taking listeners to London, offering free convertible GTIs for a month and, for over a year, had the successful television presenter Jorge Gabriel as an announcer. These changes were fruitful for the station, as it became the most-heard local radio station in central Portugal according to Marktest.\n\nOn 27 April 2001, 94FM opened a subsidiary station in Cadaval, 94FM Oeste, on 94.2 FM. This station changed its physical headquarters in September 2004, carrying local programming and some relays from the head station in Leiria. With these two stations, 94FM consolidated its listener base in southern Leiria and parts of Santarém.\n\nWinds from Subtropical Storm Alpha knocked off its tower in September 2020, with the tower damaged beyond repair.\n\nThe station was acquired by Grupo Observador in June 2024, and at 3:57pm on 12 July 2024, ceased broadcasting definetly, being replaced by a relay of Rádio Observador from Lisbon. With the acquisition, Leiria lost its last local radio station. Rádio Observador's new frequency was the sixth overall.\nReferences\n\nCategory:Portuguese-language radio stations\nCategory:Radio stations in Portugal\nCategory:Radio stations established in 1985\nCategory:Radio stations disestablished in 2024\nCategory:1985 establishments in Portugal\nCategory:2024 disestablishments in Portugal", "revision_time": "2024-07-14T15:09:55Z", "last_edit_time": "2024-07-26", "word_count": 322, "external_links": ["https://www.radio94fm.pt]", "http://radio94fm.pt/historia.html", "https://web.archive.org/web/20030206204725/http://radio94fm.pt/historia.html", "http://www.radio94fm.pt/portal/index.php?id=1094&layout=detail&mode=show", "https://web.archive.org/web/20050305214355/http://www.radio94fm.pt/portal/index.php?id=1094&layout=detail&mode=show", "https://www.regiaodeleiria.pt/2020/09/leiria-ciclone-alpha-derruba-torre-da-radio-94fm|date=19", "https://www.regiaodeleiria.pt/2024/07/radio-94fm-comprada-pelo-grupo-observador/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20240712012603/https://www.regiaodeleiria.pt/2024/07/radio-94fm-comprada-pelo-grupo-observador/", "https://observador.pt/2024/07/14/radio-observador-chega-a-leiria-na-frequencia-94-0-fm/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20240714150459/https://observador.pt/2024/07/14/radio-observador-chega-a-leiria-na-frequencia-94-0-fm/"], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiria", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiria", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rádio_Observador", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Gabriel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropical_Storm_Alpha_(2020)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rádio_Observador", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Portuguese-language_radio_stations", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Radio_stations_in_Portugal", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Radio_stations_established_in_1985", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Radio_stations_disestablished_in_2024", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1985_establishments_in_Portugal", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2024_disestablishments_in_Portugal"], "external_links_per_word": 0.031055900621118012, "internal_links_per_word": 0.040372670807453416}

{"title": "Stereogirl", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereogirl", "content": " is a Japanese alternative rock band from Tokyo, Japan. It consists of lead vocalist Anju Mouri, guitarists Usami Riko and Kanako Yoshida, bassist Riku Otsuka, and drummer Yuka Tachizaki. Formed in a high school music club in 2014, the band started band activities in 2018 with the release of their debut mini-LP, Baby, Bokura wa L.S.D., which saw considerable success. \n\nThe band would later release their debut album, Pink Fog in 2019. The band continued to release music, including their second album, Spirit & Opportunity, in 2022. Originally an all-girl band, Riku Otsuka later joined as the bassist, transitioning the lineup to include both male and female members. The band's music has been described as blending shoegaze, pop-punk, and alternative rock influences, drawing inspiration from American and British bands.\n\n History \nthumb|left|Stereogirl performing in 2019.\nStereogirl was formed within a high school music club, featuring Anju Mohri on vocals and Kanako Yoshida on guitar. After experiencing their classmate Yuka Tachizaki's drumming, they decided to invite her to join the band. Tachizaki agreed on the condition that her friend, Riko \"Chamicot\" Usami, could join as well. Originally an all-girl band, Riku Otsuka later joined as the bassist after the original bassist quit. Otsuka was a fan and friend of the members before officially becoming part of the band.\n\nOn June 1, 2018, they released their debut mini-LP titled Baby, Bokura wa L.S.D., which was repeatedly sold out and restocked at record shops and online stores. On December 3, 2019, the band released the single \"Oyasumi Goodnight,\" their first to be released digitally on streaming services. They released their second mini-LP, NADA, on February 20, 2019.\n\nIn March 2020, the band was chosen by Tower Records as a recommended and top pick for the month of April, and on June 3, 2020, the band released their first album, \"Pink Fog,\" which included a remix of \"Oyasumi Goodnight.\" The release was postponed from April 15, and a planned release event in Tokyo was canceled. On February 16, 2022, they released their second album, Spirit & Opportunity, two years after their previous album, Pink Fog. On February 17, 2021, and March 17, they released the songs \"Scooter\" and \"Angel, Here We Come.\" These releases were their first new singles since the release of Pink Fog and were described as having an alternative rock vibe. In April, they held their first solo concert in Tokyo and Osaka to commemorate the release of their second album.\n\n Musical style and influences \nNext Music from Tokyo organizer Steven Tanaka described Stereogirl for the Vancouver Sun as having a \"shoegaze-tinged pop-punk sound\" that was influenced by American and British bands such as Pavement, The Smiths, and The Stone Roses. He added that they were \"writing incredibly catchy, heartfelt songs and are light years ahead of most bands in terms of stage presence.\" Ed Cunningham of the Tokyo Weekender stated that they combine \"punk rock simplicity with the melodic elements of indie rock, spun through a punch of thick, alt-rock layering and shoegaze-esque feedback.\" Author Ed Cunningham for The Glow described them as \"lay[ing] their influences on their sleeve, specializing in catchy, familiar few-chord indie anthems.\"\n\n Band members \n – vocals\n – guitar\n – guitar\n – bass\n – drums\n\n Discography \n Studio albums \n+ List of studio albums with chart positions Title Album details Peak chart positions (JP) Albums Indie AlbumsPink FogReleased: June 3, 2020\nLabel: Chigakushitsu Records\nFormat: CD, streaming989Spirit & OpportunityReleased: February 16, 2022\nLabel: Chigakushitsu Records\nFormat: CD, streaming——\n\n References ", "revision_time": "2024-07-29T21:30:31Z", "last_edit_time": "2024-07-29", "word_count": 573, "external_links": ["https://www.nextmusicfromtokyo.com/stereogirl|title=ステレオガール", "https://metropolisjapan.com/stereogirl/|title=STEREOGIRL", "https://skream.jp/news/2018/11/stereogirl_bokuraha_wakakute_utsukushii_mv.php|title=都内を中心に活動する5人組バンド", "https://rock-is.tv/features/201808/10959|title=サマソニやOTODAMAにも出演、1stミニ『ベイビー、ぼくらはL.S.D』が話題のステレオガールに動画インタビュー|language=ja|website=Rock", "https://natalie.mu/music/news/357961|title=ステレオガール初の配信シングル「おやすみグッドナイト」MVはクラシックカーで疾走|language=ja|website=[[Natalie", "https://skream.jp/news/2019/01/stereo_girl_iwanna_mv.php|title=都内を中心に活動する5人組バンド", "https://indiegrab.jp/news/63688/|title=【NEWS】ステレオガール", "https://mikiki.tokyo.jp/articles/-/25350|title=ステレオガールは一体化を拒み、自由をめざす。〈好きに踊りたいだけ〉な5人が『Pink", "https://natalie.mu/music/news/366453|title=ステレオガール、1stフルアルバム「Pink", "https://www.billboard-japan.com/d_news/detail/86089/2|title=ステレオガールの新曲「春眠」MV公開、アルバム『Pink", "https://www.billboard-japan.com/d_news/detail/107699|title=ステレオガールの2ndフルAL『Spirit&Opportunity』2月リリース＆東京と大阪でワンマン開催|language=ja|website=[[Billboard", "https://tower.jp/article/feature_item/2022/01/25/0711|title=", "https://www.billboard-japan.com/d_news/detail/98117/2|title=ステレオガールの新曲「Angel,Here", "https://natalie.mu/music/news/415551|title=ステレオガール、90'sオルタナ突き詰めた2曲を連続配信|date=February", "https://www.cinra.net/news/20210210-stereogirl|title=", "https://ongakutohito.com/2022/05/14/stereogirl-livereport/|title=ステレオガール、初のワンマン。殻を破り、一歩踏み出した夜のこと|language=ja|website=Ongakutohito|date=May", "https://vancouversun.com/entertainment/local-arts/five-reasons-to-check-out-next-music-from-tokyo-vol-14|title=Five", "https://www.tokyoweekender.com/entertainment/music/eds-picks-top-5-japanese-albums-june-2020/|title=Ed’s", "https://theglow.jp/features/on-file-stereogirl|title=On"], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_by_Southwest", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mini-LP", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shoegaze", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pop-punk", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alternative_rock", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SXSW_2019_-_STEREOGIRL_(32494672127).jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mini-LP", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_(website)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_(website)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Japan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Japan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Records_Japan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Japan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alternative_rock", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_(website)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Sun", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shoegaze", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavement_(band)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smiths", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stone_Roses", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Sun", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Weekender", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oricon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oricon_Albums_Chart", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oricon"], "external_links_per_word": 0.03315881326352531, "internal_links_per_word": 0.0506108202443281}
{"title": "Nkhamanga Kingdom", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nkhamanga_Kingdom", "content": "The Nkhamanga Kingdom was a pre-colonial kingdom located in the region of Malawi, specifically in the northern and central areas. The kingdom was established in the 18th century by the Chitumbuka people, a Bantu-speaking group.\n\n History \n\n Formation \nThe Tumbuka people originated from the Congo basin and settled in the area, where they became the leading residents. The group formed a kingdom and set up a ruling class with a king as the head. They lived in a compact area where each village was headed by one particular clan such as the Luhanga or Mkandawire clans. The Tumbuka community was recognized as a peaceful society without significant central authority or taxes. Instead, they showed their appreciation for their leaders through symbolic gestures, like offering leopard or lion skins as special tributes, reflecting their emphasis on community and mutual respect.https://allafrica.com/stories/202205180419.html\n\n Balowoka \nIn the late 18th century, a group of traders led by Kakalala Msawira Gondwe arrived in Nkhamanga from Nyamwezi, seeking to capitalize on the abundant elephant population and lucrative ivory trade. The region, known for its vast elephant herds, was dubbed \"elephant built.\" The traders, dubbed the Balowoka, meaning \"those who crossed the lake,\" had traversed Lake Malawi in dhows in 1750. They settled peacefully in the Henga valley, Hewe, and Nkhamanga, integrating into the local Tumbuka community without conflict or coercion.\n\n Creation of the kingdom \nThe Balowoka traders played a crucial role in the formation of the Nkhamanga State. There are two competing theories that attempt to explain how they managed to establish their political influence in the Tumbuka region. The first theory suggests that they leveraged their trading prowess to gain power, while the second theory proposes that they used military force to conquer and dominate the area. These two theories offer different perspectives on the Balowoka's rise to political authority.\n\n The trade theory \nThe trade theory suggests that Mlowoka, a wealthy trader, established the Nkhamanga State through his business ventures. He formed friendships with local chiefs, exchanging goods like clothes, beads, and hoes for ivory and leopard skins. By marrying into powerful families like the Luhanga and Kumwenda, Mlowoka solidified his ties to the region and strengthened his economic influence. When his father-in-law, Mubila Luhanga, passed away, Mlowoka's son, Gonapamuhanya, ascended to the throne, cementing the Balowoka's political power. However, some historians, like Leroy Vail, disagree with this theory, viewing Mlowoka as merely a merchant seeking fortune, rather than a political leader who established a kingdom.\n\n The invader theory \nHistorians Saulos Nyirenda and Cullen Young supported the theory that Mlowoka, a political leader, founded the Nkhamanga State. They argued that Mlowoka's marriages into the Luhanga and Kumwenda families enabled him to exert political influence, introducing administrative and coronation practices that fostered peace among the Tumbuka people. Mlowoka's military presence expanded the kingdom's reach, stretching from the South Rukuru River to Bisa country in the west and Lake Malawi in the east. When Mlowoka died, his son Gonapamuhanya inherited the throne, solidifying the Balowoka dynasty's grip on the region.\n\n Mlowoka's strategies \nMlowoka's strategic gift-giving and intermarriage with the Tumbuka families of Luhanga and Kumwenda earned him their support and acceptance as a relative. He gained the people's trust through fair and generous trade practices, respecting their customs and traditions. He showed reverence for their beliefs by paying annual tribute to the Mwadandambi shrine and honoring clan heads with symbolic turbans. By distributing valuable holes (likely a valuable resource for farming or craftsmanship), he won their admiration and was hailed as Chikulamayembe, meaning \"the distributor of holes.\n\n References \n\n \nCategory:Former British colonies and protectorates in Africa\nCategory:History of Malawi\nCategory:Monarchies of Malawi\nCategory:Former empires in Africa\nCategory:19th-century disestablishments in Africa", "revision_time": "2024-08-03T23:18:36Z", "last_edit_time": "2024-08-03", "word_count": 605, "external_links": ["https://www.nyasatimes.com/chakwera-installs-new-chikulamayembe-king-of-nkhamanga-kingdom-amid-chaotic-scenes/", "https://mscehistorynotes.wordpress.com/2015/09/06/tumbuka-nkhamanga-kingdom/", "https://www.nyasatimes.com/political-posturing-and-rivalry-stunts-at-chikulamayembe-funeral-condemned-call-for-code-of-conduct/", "https://allafrica.com/stories/202205180419.html", "https://mbc.mw/chakwera-rebukes-harmful-cultural-practices/"], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumbuka_people", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_basin", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mkandawire", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Nkhamanga_Kingdom", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Former_British_colonies_and_protectorates_in_Africa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:History_of_Malawi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Monarchies_of_Malawi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Former_empires_in_Africa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:19th-century_disestablishments_in_Africa"], "external_links_per_word": 0.008264462809917356, "internal_links_per_word": 0.01652892561983471}
{"title": "2029 Special Olympics World Winter Games", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2029_Special_Olympics_World_Winter_Games", "content": "The Special Olympics World Winter Games 2029 are a planned international multi-sport event. It will be the 13th Special Olympics International Winter Games. They are scheduled to be held in March 2029, in the cantons of Graubünden and Zurich, Switzerland . The sporting part will be held entirely in the canton of Graubünden, and the opening ceremony is scheduled to take place in Zurich.\n\n Application, award and planning process \nThe application was prepared by  in partnership with seven public partners (Switzerland, the canton of Grisons, municipalities ofVaz/Obervaz and Arosa, and the cities Chur, Zürich and Zürich. The University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons was also involved in the preparation.\n\nOn 18 and 19 June 2021, Switzerland was awarded the event by the Special Olympics. The condition was that public funding had to be available by 30 September 2022; this was achieved. The contract was awarded at the same time as the 2025 Special Olympics World Winter Games was awarded to Turin.\n\nThe opening ceremony is to take place on March 6, 2029 in the Letzigrund Stadium in Zurich, with the closing ceremony in Chur supported by the Host Town Program throughout Switzerland. This offers sporting, cultural and entertainment activities, a social exchange with the local population and lived inclusion. For this purpose, the delegations will be assigned to the cantons in the days before the games according to possibilities; 23 of them will be guests in the twelve districts of the canton of Zurich and twelve districts of the city of Zurich, for example. For this purpose, each Host Town Committee will develop a concept based on free accommodation, food and transport for the international guests. The Canton of Zurich expects around 6,100 overnight stays for the Host Town Program and the opening ceremony, around 10,000 visitors for the opening ceremony and around 2,000 participants at the meetings, receptions and congresses.\n\nAround 2,500 athletes from 110 nations are expected to take part in the games. According to the funding decision, 650 coaches are also expected, making the World Games the second largest multi-sport event in the world after the Olympic Games.\n\nThe games are intended to enable universities and technical colleges to plan and carry out scientific projects on inclusion.\n\nThe Pre-Games are expected to take place in Chur from March 13 to 18, 2028. They are also the National Games of SOSWI and the test event for the WWG 2029. Over 800 athletes and coaches will take part in the sports planned for the WWG 2029 over six days. International delegations, primarily from Europe, are also expected. The competitions are to be held in the competition venues in Graubünden that are also planned for the World Games. In addition to the competitions, experience with accommodation and logistics is to be gained. The opening and closing ceremonies are to take place in Chur.\n\n Goals \nAn important goal is the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Switzerland. It is planned that the partners of the World Games - from the host cities to the sponsors and contractors - will set an example in a charter and begin with concrete measures, such as creating jobs in the primary labour market. Around 30 people are involved in the drafting of the charter. They are to form an inclusion advisory board that will have an advisory function, but also monitor compliance with the charter in the organization of the World Games. The charter is to be presented in 2023. As part of the candidacy for the Special Olympics World Winter Games 2029, a basic study was prepared to improve inclusion in sport, housing and the working world in Switzerland.\n\n Sports and venues \nThe following nine sports will be represented:\n\n Figure skating (Chur)\n Floor Hockey (Chur)\n Snowshoeing (Lenzerheide)\n Short Track (Chur)\n Alpine skiing (Arosa)\n Cross-country skiing (Lenzerheide)\n Snowboarding (Arosa)\n Dance sport (Lenzerheide)\n Indoor hockey (also called unihockey or floorball) (Chur)\n\n Organisation \nThe board of the organization responsible for holding the games is preparing to start its operational activities at the beginning of 2024. The full board is comprised of seven people: the president is Bruno Barth, the managing director of Special Olympics Switzerland. The office of vice president is held by the FDP politician and president of the World Games Association Urs Marti, who was very committed to awarding the games to Graubünden. He will remain in office as mayor of Chur until the end of 2024. The two board members Luana Bergamin and Stefan Frey come from the board of trustees of Special Olympics Switzerland. Lea Sandoz-Mey is committed to inclusion: as part of her high school diploma thesis , she founded the Inclusion 360 association shortly before the turn of the millennium and started a project in Zimbabwe in collaboration with the local Sunshine Project. The board also includes Hans-Willy Brockes, founder and managing director of the ESB Marketing Network with more than 550 partners. He is very well known and well connected in European sports sponsorship. By the end of 2023, one more person with cognitive impairment will be admitted to the Presidium.\n\nBeat Ritschard was appointed Secretary General.\n\n Financing \nThe total budget is 38 million Swiss francs. Around three quarters of this will be financed by public bodies.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, the two chambers of the Swiss Federal Assembly approved 28.6 million Swiss francs for major sporting events of international importance for the years 2025 to 2029, of which 9.5 million francs are earmarked for the Special Olympics World Winter Games 2029. The other public partners of Special Olympics Switzerland had already pledged 19.1 million Swiss francs for the games at an earlier date, subject to a positive decision by the Federal Assembly. Of this sum, 1.8 million francs will come from the canton of Zurich's charitable fund, formerly known as the lottery fund. In Chur, voters approved a loan of 4.25 million francs for the hosting of the games by 7026 votes to 4155. This corresponds to a yes vote share of 62.84 percent.\n\nThe public funding of the games is thus secured. As soon as the text of the vote is available, the formal commitment can be obtained from Special Olympics International and an implementation agreement can be drawn up.\n\n Public relations \n\n Logo \nThe logo is to be developed by the Nyon-based agency Twist by the end of 2023. Workshops for this began in 2023, with members of the Special Olympics Athletes Commission and employees of Twist's Studio Intégratif also participating.\n\n Sponsorships \nThe mountain biker Nino Schurter is an ambassador for the games. He is an Olympic champion (2016), ten-time world champion and eight-time winner of the UCI overall World Cup in cross country.\n\n Weblinks \n\n Interview with Bruno Barth about the Special Olympics

{"title": "MOBIB", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOBIB", "content": "MOBIB, also written as MoBIB, is a contactless smart card used as an integrated ticketing system for 'travel products' of most public transport in the Belgium. First introduced by Brussels' MIVB in 2008, it has since has expanded to include the public transport operators NMBS, De Lijn, and TEC. Each operator issues a MOBIB card with a unique design, but it can be used with all four operators. Transport tickets are usually specific to each operator, though some subscriptions, such as 'Brupass' and 'Brupass XL', are valid across multiple operators.\n\nThe card contains a near-field communication (NFC) tag and is compatible with the ISO 7816 contact interface. It can store up to eight tickets, including single trips, multi-trip passes, and subscriptions. Additionally, bicycle-sharing (like Villo! and Blue-Bike), car-sharing (such as Cambio), and station parking subscriptions can also be loaded onto the card.\n\nUnlike the Dutch OV-chipkaart, the MOBIB card is not a stored-value card and therefore does not support loading a monetary balance. For all journeys, a pre-purchased ticket, specific to the trip, must be loaded onto the card.\n\nThe card can be held a few centimeters away from the reader and uses the Calypso standard, similar to the French Navigo card. With an NFC-enabled smartphone and the MOBIB app, users can check the card's contents. This can also be done via the info button on validation devices, at ticket machines, or at service counters.\n\n References \n\nCategory:Public transport in Belgium\nCategory:Fare collection systems\nCategory:Contactless smart cards", "revision_time": "2024-09-22T23:02:52Z", "last_edit_time": "2024-09-22", "word_count": 241, "external_links": ["https://newmobility.news/2024/07/24/digital-boarding-at-de-lijn-now-possible/", "https://www.delijn.be/en/content/vervoerbewijzen/mobib/", "https://help.delijn.be/hc/en-us/articles/360039675351-Can-I-use-my-MOBIB-card-with-different-transport-operators", "https://datanews.knack.be/nieuws/innovatie/mobiliteit/de-lijn-introduceert-digitaal-opstappen-voor-abonnementhouders-in-app/", "https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/travel-info/prepare-for-your-journey/mobib-card/get-a-mobib-card", "https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/support/faq/faq-tickets-and-railcards/faq-mobib", "https://mobib.be/en.html"], "internal_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/contactless_smart_card", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/integrated_ticketing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_transport", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIVB", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMBS", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Lijn", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEC_(transport)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/near-field_communication", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_7816", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle-sharing_system", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villo!", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carsharing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambio_CarSharing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OV-chipkaart", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stored-value_card", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calypso_(electronic_ticketing_system)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigo_card", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Public_transport_in_Belgium", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fare_collection_systems", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Contactless_smart_cards"], "external_links_per_word": 0.029045643153526972, "internal_links_per_word": 0.08713692946058091}
