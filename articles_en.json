        "content": "Joseph Aaron Clevenger (; born April 22, 1980) is an American educator who has served as the superintendent of Bonsall Unified School District since July 1, 2021. Prior to his tenure as superintendent, he served as the Principal of Rancho Buena Vista High School from 2019 to 2021.\n\n Early Life and Education \nClevenger was born on April 22, 1980, in Provo, Utah, the son of a molecular biologist and a high school physics teacher. He grew up in Seattle, Washington, before moving to Vista, California, where he attended Rancho Buena Vista High School. After graduating, Clevenger served as a full-time missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, where he became fluent in Spanish.\n\nClevenger attended California State University San Marcos, where he earned a bachelor's degree in liberal arts in 2004. He attended Pepperdine University from 2008 to 2010, receiving a  master's degree in education.\n\n Career \nClevenger began his career in Riverside County, working as a teacher and administrator for Santa Rosa Academy and Elsinore Unified School District before transferring south to San Diego County, where he served as the principal of Normal L. Sullivan Middle School in 2015. As principal of Sullivan Middle School, he was responsible for increasing access to STEM programs on campus and academic outreach support for low-income students, especially indigenous students from the Pala Indian Reservation. After the Lilac fire of 2017 devastated much of Bonsall and the neighboring community, Clevenger was instrumental in leading the cleanup and response that followed, both in the community and at the school, and was recognized by local leaders and afflicted families for his disaster relief efforts.\n\nIn 2019, Clevenger was hired as the principal of Rancho Buena Vista High School, where he had graduated as a student some 20 years beforehand. He was critical in leading the school's response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, and often shared his experience in forums for public educators about his student-focused approach to getting back to the \"new normal.\"\n\nIn June 2021, it was announced that Clevenger would return to Bonsall, this time to serve as superintendent. His work as superintendent has included traffic upgrades for schools, speaking at statewide events about his experiences succeeding during the pandemic, and lobbying for the construction of new schools in the district, including a new campus for Bonsall High School and a new elementary school in northern Bonsall. In March 2023, the California Department of Education recognized 59 schools across the entire state of more than 10,000 schools for the Purple Star award, given for a school's excellence in serving the children of military families and veterans. All five of the schools in Bonsall Unified School District were recipients, an unprecedented occasion that prompted an award ceremony at Bonsall West Elementary School featuring Lieutenant General George W. Smith Jr., Commanding General I Marine Expeditionary Force, and a number of prominent military and community leaders.\n\nIn 2023, Clevenger debuted the Bonsall Forward Initiative, a scholarship fund aimed at addressing the disparity in female and underrepresented populations in STEM academics in careers by better funding classrooms and by awarding scholarship money to students as early as 6th grade.\n\nPersonal life\nJoseph Clevenger has lived in Southern California for over 30 years. He currently lives in Temecula, California, with his wife Kim and their 8 children. He is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Clevenger enjoys surfing, gardening, and traveling with his family.\n\nClevenger currently serves as President of the Rotary Club of Bonsall.\nSee also\n Bonsall Unified School District\n Lilac Fire\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:1980 births\nCategory:21st-century American educators\nCategory:Schoolteachers from California\nCategory:California State University, San Marcos alumni\nCategory:Pepperdine University alumni",

        "content": "The graduated majority judgment (GMJ), sometimes called the usual judgment or continuous-time Bucklin voting, is a single-winner electoral system first suggested as an improvement on majority judgment by Jameson Quinn, and later independently by the French social scientist Adrien Fabre in 2019. It is a highest median voting method, a system of cardinal voting in which the winner is decided by the median rating rather than the mean.\n\n Highest medians \n\nThe elector rates each candidate on a common scale, such as:\nAwfulBadTolerableNeutralAcceptableGoodExcellentCandidate AXCandidate BXCandidate CXCandidate DX\nWhen counting the votes, we calculate the share of each grade for each of the votes cast. This is the candidate's \"merit profile\":\nCandidateAwfulBadTolerableNeutralAcceptableGoodExcellentA2%15%21%20%9%18%15%B2%17%19%13%13%12%24%C1%9%10%15%15%25%25%\nFor each candidate, we determine the median or majority grade as the grade where a majority of voters would oppose giving the candidate a higher grade, but a majority would also oppose giving a lower grade. This rule means that the absolute majority of the electors judge that a candidates merits at least its median grade, while half the electors judge that he deserves at most its median grade.\n\nIf only one candidate has the highest median grade, they are elected (as in all highest median voting rules). Otherwise, the election uses a tie-breaking procedure.\n\n Tie-breaking \nGraduated majority judgment uses a simple line-drawing method to break ties. This rule is easier to explain than others such as majority judgment, and also guarantees continuity.\n\nGraphically, we can represent this by drawing a plot showing the share of voters who assign an approval less than the given score, then draw lines connecting the points on this graph. The place where this plot intersects 50% is each candidate's score.\n\n Example \nConsider the same election as before, but relabeling the grades as numbers.\n0123156A2%15%21%20%9%18%15%Running total2%17%39%58%68%85%100%B2%17%19%13%13%12%24%Running total2%19%38%51%64%76%100%C1%9%10%15%15%25%25%Running total1%10%20%35%50%75%100%\nthumb|371x371px|A plot showing how the overall score of a candidate can be calculated using graduated majority judgment.\nCandidates A and B both receive a median grade between 2 or 3 (i.e. their median falls between 2 and 3), so we must invoke the tiebreaking procedure. When we do, we find that the median grades for candidates A, B, and C are 3.4, 3.1, and 2.0 respectively. Thus, Candidate A is declared the winner. \n\n Race analogy \nThe tiebreaking rule can be explained using an analogy where every candidate is in a race. Each candidate takes 1 minute to run from one grade to the next, and they run at a constant speed when moving from one grade to the next. The winner is the first candidate to cross the finish line at 50% of the vote.\n\n Mathematical description \nSay the median grade of a candidate  is  (when there is a tie, we define the median as the average of neighboring grades). Let  (the share of proponents) refer to the share of electors giving  a score strictly better than . For example, all the electors who rated a candidate as receiving , while his or her median grade is \"Fair\".\n\n The share of opponents of , called , refers to the share of electors giving  a appreciation strictly inferior to its median grade . For example, all the electors who rated a candidate as \"Bad\", \"Inadequate\" or \"Passable\", while his or her median grade is \"Fair\".\n\nThen the complete score for GMJ can be described with the following formula:\n\n Additional tie-breaking \nIn the unusual situation where the tie-breaking formula above does not determine a single winner (if several candidates have exactly the same score), ties can be broken by binning together the 3 grades closest to the median. In the example above, we would combine all \"Good,\" \"Fair,\" and \"Passable\" grades into a new \"Passable to Good\" grade, then apply the same tie-breaking formula as before. This process can be repeated multiple times (binning more and more grades) until a winner is found. If no winner is found, this implies two candidates have received exactly the same number of votes in every grade, an extremely unlikely situation.\n\n Properties and advantages \n\n Advantages and disadvantages common to highest-median rules \n\nAs an electoral system, the graduated majority judgment shares most of its advantages with other highest-median voting rules such as majority judgment, including its resistance to tactical voting, but also shares most of its disadvantages (for example, it fails the participation criterion, and can fail the majority criterion arbitrarily badly).\n\n Specific advantages of graduated majority judgment \nThe tie-breaking formula of the graduated majority judgment presents specific advantages over the other highest-median voting rules.\n\n Continuity \nThe function defined by the graduated majority judgment tie-breaking formula is a continuous function (as well as being almost-everywhere differentiable), whereas the functions of majority judgment and typical judgment are discontinuous. In other words, a small change in the number of votes for each candidate is unlikely to change the winner of the election, because small changes in vote shares result in only small changes in the overall rating.\n\nThis property makes the graduated majority judgment a more robust voting method in the face of accusations of fraud or demands of a recount of all votes. As small differences of votes are less likely to change the outcome of the election, candidates are less likely to contest results.\n\n Rare ties \nThe additional tiebreaking procedures of graduated majority judgment mean that tied elections become extremely unlikely (far less likely than systems such as plurality). Whereas plurality votes, ranked voting, and approval voting can result in ties when working with small elections, the only way for two candidates to tie with usual judgment is to have all candidates receive exactly the same number of votes in every grade category, implying the chances of an undetermined election fall exponentially with the number of grades.\n\n See also \n\n Majority judgment\n\n Highest median voting rules\n Range voting\n\n References ",

        "content": "Novi Ligure railway station (Italian: stazione di Novi Ligure) is a railway station located in the centre of the town of Novi Ligure in the province of Alessandria, in the region of Piedmont in Italy. The station was opened in 1850 as part of the Turin–Genoa railway . In 1858, the line between Novi Ligure and Tortona was opened.  The train services are operated by Trenitalia.\n\nThree tracks are used for passenger services, and there is also a freight yard with several spurs. The station has one side platform, adjacent to the station building, and one island platform connected by a pedestrian underpass. Both platforms are low level. There a passenger drop-off area, taxi stand and local bus stops in front of the station building, which contains a ticket office, a waiting room, a bar and toilets.\n\nAll four Novi Ligure local bus routes start and end at the railway station.https://novionline.ilpiccolo.net/2023/07/19/novi-bus-company-vara-le-nuove-linee-trasporto-urbano/ \n\nHistory\nA 22-km section of the Turin–Genoa railway between Alessandria and Novi Ligure was opened on 1 January 1850; on 10 February 1852 this line was extended to Arquata Scrivia to the east.. On 25 January 1858 the connection between Tortona and Novi Ligure was opened. This connection formed, from 1867, a part of the new Milan–Genoa railway. On 1 October 1916, however, a new line between Arquata Scrivia and Tortona was built, making the Milan–Genoa trains bypass Novi Ligure from then on.\n\n Train services \nThe station is served by Trenitalia trains between Torino Porta Nuova and  Genova Piazza Principe, typically once per hour in each direction.http://www.viaggiatreno.it/infomobilita/index.jsp\n\nUntil 2017, there were also passenger services on the Tortona-Novi Ligure line, but they have been suspended during the construction of the Tortona–Genoa high-speed railway https://www.lastampa.it/alessandria/2017/08/30/news/dal-4-settembre-la-linea-fs-novi-tortona-chiusa-gli-orari-dei-bus-sostitutivi-per-proseguire-e-tornare-da-milano-1.34443815/\n\nSee also\n\n History of rail transport in Italy\n List of railway stations in Piedmont\n Rail transport in Italy\n Railway stations in Italy\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:Railway stations in Piedmont\nCategory:Railway stations in Italy opened in 1850",

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storms_(Fleetwood_Mac_song)",
        "content": "\"Storms\" is a song by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released in 1979. Composed and sung by vocalist Stevie Nicks, it was one of her five songs that appeared on the Tusk album. The song was also included on the US 2002 and UK 2009 editions of The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac as the final track on disc one. An alternate mix with more stripped back production was included on the 2015 deluxe edition of Tusk. Nicks said that the song was about her affair with bandmate Mick Fleetwood, which she believed contributed to the dissolution of his marriage with Jenny Boyd.\n\nBackground\n\"Storms\" was the first song that Nicks presented for the Tusk album. In its demo form, the song only consisted of vocals and a rough piano part played by Nicks. Carol Anne Harris recalled that his former boyfriend, Lindsey Buckingham, was critical of \"Storms\" when Nicks played her demo to the band, which led to a screaming match between Nicks and Buckingham. Producer Ken Caillat described the demo as \"a somewhat depressing song with only a few chords\". However, when the band revisited \"Storms\" in autumn 1978, both Caillat and engineer Hernán Rojas were surprised at Buckingham's willingness to dedicate his efforts toward the song. Buckingham later expressed his approval of \"Storms\" in 2015, calling it \"a very strong song in terms of its form\".\n\nThe band worked on \"Storms\" the day after a recording session for \"That's All For Everyone\", a Buckingham composition. While the band was tracking \"That's All For Everyone\", Nicks grew bored and eventually insisted during a dinner that the band record \"Storms\" the following day, which they agreed to. Rojas remembered that Nicks felt excessively criticized by the band when she asked to record one of her own songs. \"It wasn't that Stevie's songs weren't good, just that they presented more of a challenge, not only to arrange the song structure, but also to give it a brighter mood.\"\n\nFor the initial tracking of \"Storms\", Buckingham strummed an acoustic guitar over a click track, although he later replaced that part with a fingerpicked nylon-string guitar and two arpeggiated electric guitars: one recorded clean another distorted. Christine McVie played a Hammond B-3 organ through a rotating Leslie speaker and also overdubbed a Fender Rhodes electric piano to supplement Buckingham's guitars and John McVie's acoustic bass guitar. Fleetwood originally played a reverbed snare drum and shaker on the downbeats, although this was replaced with a tambourine and a muted floor tom. The producers also applied equalization to transform the click track into a kick drum.\n\nCritical reception\nPaste ranked the song number nine its list of the 30 greatest Fleetwood Mac songs, writing that \"there’s something particularly waxing and enchanting about \"Storms,\" especially as the band’s gorgeous, melodic and dreamy backing instrumentation bubbles behind her [Nicks's] confident and worn-in vocals.\" Rolling Stone labeled \"Storms\" as a \"lovely ballad\", but said that \"the production goes too far, and the track quivers with an eerie electronic vibrato\"..\n\nPersonnel\nStevie Nicks – lead vocals\nLindsey Buckingham – guitars, backing vocals\nChristine McVie – keyboards, backing vocals\nJohn McVie – bass guitar\nMick Fleetwood – tambourine, floor tom\n\n References \n\nCategory:Fleetwood Mac songs\nCategory:1979 songs\nCategory:Songs written by Lindsey Buckingham\nCategory:Song recordings produced by Ken Caillat\nCategory:Song recordings produced by Richard Dashut",

Reverse: A lyre surrounded by \"Year two to the freedom of Israel\".\nBar Kokhba Revolt coinage were coins issued by the Judaean rebel state, headed by Simon Bar Kokhba, during the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire of 132–135 CE.\n\nDuring the Revolt, large quantities of coins were issued in silver and copper with rebellious inscriptions, all being overstruck over foreign (mostly Roman) coins, when a file was used to remove the designs of the original coins, such as the portrait of the Roman Emperor. The undercoin can clearly be seen on some of the silver coins because they were not filed down so as not to lose the value of the silver. On the bronze coins it is very difficult to see the underlying coin because they were filed down before they were over-struck. In rare instances, the coin cracked when it was overstruck.Handbook of Biblical Numismatics pg 19\n\nThe name \"Shim'on\" (likely referring to the leader of the Revolt, Shim'on (Simon) Bar Koseba) appears on all of the coins of the Bar Kochba Revolt except for a few types issued at the beginning of the Revolt with the name \"Eleazar the Priest (Cohen),\". The overstruck silver shekel/tetradrachms (see illustration) are among the most religiously significant coins issued by the ancient Jews, because the Holy of Holies of the Jerusalem Temple is shown, with the Ark of the Covenant. The word  \"Jerusalem\" was inscribed around the representation of the Temple. Beginning in the second year of issue and continuing into the final year, a star appeared above the Temple on many coins, probably in reference to Bar Kochba's nickname \"Son of the Star\". Agricultural symbols connected with the Jewish harvest festival of Sukkot, such as lulav and etrog, appear on the reverse of some of the smaller bronze coins, surrounded by a Hebrew inscription: 'Year One of the Redemption of Israel', 'Year Two of the Freedom of Israel',  or 'For the Freedom of Jerusalem'.\n\nIn May 2020, a coin embossed with grapes and 'Year Two of the Freedom of Israel' was found in the William Davidson Archaeological Park next to the Western Wall in Jerusalem. This was only the fourth coin from this period to be found in the area, and the only Bar Kochba coin to have Jerusalem's name on it.\n\nAlternative attributions\nThe first group of these coins reviewed by numismatists were 10 silver pieces and one bronze piece found in the mid-nineteenth century.History of Jewish coinage, and of money in the Old and New Testament, Frederic William Madden, Pegasus Pub. Co., 1967, Introduction, \"Madden's chapter IX, \"Money Struck during the Second Revolt of the Jews,\" lists only those coins of \"Simon Bar Cochab\" which were overstruck on coins of the Roman emperors from Vespasian onwards, and which could not therefore fit in any way into Madden's scheme of the \"Simon\" or \"Eleazar\" coins allegedly of the First Revolt. He notes, of course, that some of the coins of Bar Cochab \"appear to have been struck from the same stamp as those of Simon son of Gioras.\" His attribution of these coins to Bar Kochba follows that of Levy. The original group attributed to Bar Kochba numbered 10 silver pieces and one bronze piece in Madden's book of 1864; in 1881 they had grown to 43, including the tetradrachm with the star.\" By 1881 the number of coins had grown to 43, and many more have been found since.Historia Judaica 11.1, April 1949 These coins were first attributed to Bar Kokhba by Moritz Abraham Levy in 1862 and Frederic Madden in 1864.\n\nSince the mid-nineteenth century, a number of scholars have provided alternative attributions for the coins. Claude Reignier Conder, writing in 1909, suggested that the coins were forgeries of the coins of Simon Thassi.The City of Jerusalem By Colonel C. R. Conder (1909), \"Stating that \"the forgery of Jewish coins is still common in Palestine\", Conder wrote that \"the theory according to which [Bar Kochba] struck coins in Jerusalem demands notice, in connection with the history of the city, but it appears to be one of those learned fallacies which are very long in dying\"\" Wolf Wirgin, writing in 1959, suggested that the coins were instead minted by King Herod AgrippaThe History of Coins and Symbols in Ancient Israel, by Wolf Wirgin and Siegfried Mandel, 1959 Alice Muehsam, writing in 1966, suggested that those coins with dates such as \"Year 1\" were actually First Jewish Revolt coinage.Alice Muehsam, Coin and temple: a study of the architectural representation on ancient Jewish coins, 1966\n\n Outside Judaea \nAs of 2023, twenty four coins of the Bar Kokhba revolt were found outside Judaea, in various locations in the UK, Austria, Hungary, Romania and Croatia. The majority of coins were found around Roman military sites in the provinces of Britannia, Pannonia, Dacia and Dalmatia, including several legionary and auxiliary camps, though not always in a strictly military context.Eshel, H., Zissu, B., & Barkay, G. (2009). Sixteen Bar Kokhba Coins from Roman Sites in Europe. Israel Numismatic Journal, 17, 91-97.Grull, T. (2023), Bar Kokhba Coins from Roman Sites in Europe: A Reappraisal.Cesarik, N., Filipčić, D., Kramberger, V. (2018). \"Bar Kokhba’s bronze coin from Kolovare Beach in Zadar\". Journal of the Archaeological Museum in Zadar, Vol. 32. No. 32. In 2010, Eshel, Zissu, and Barkay proposed tying these coins to Roman soldiers stationed in those camps who were active in quelling the Bar Kokhba revolt and took those coins with them as souvenirs or commemorative relics. In a 2023 article, Brull proposed that some of the coins may have been brought to the Europe by Jewish captives or immigrants who arrived in those areas the revolt.\n\nSee also\n\nHistorical currencies in Judaea\nMa'ah, Aramaic for gerah, ancient Hebrew unit of weight and currency\nPrutah\nShekel, ancient Near Eastern unit of weight and coin\nZuz, ancient Jewish name for certain silver coinage\nJudaean and Judaea-related coinage\nYehud coinage\nHasmonean coinage\nHerodian coinage\nProcuratorial coinage of Roman Judaea\nFirst Jewish Revolt coinage\nJudaea Capta coinage\n List of historical currencies\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mildenberg, L.

Klesmit was nominated for USA Today Network Player of the Year as a junior after leading the Fox Valley Association conference in points per game (25.5) and assists (4.8). During his senior season, he helped lead the Rockets to a 23–2 record and reached the sectional final. He led the team scoring 25.5 points per game and 7.8 rebounds per game his senior season. Klesmit was named to the Wisconsin All-State teams following his sophomore, junior and senior seasons.\n\nCollege career\nWofford\nAfter not being highly recruited and mostly receiving Division II offers, Klesmit did receive a few Division I offers from UW–Green Bay, UW–Milwaukee, North Dakota and  Wofford.\n\nFreshman season\nKlesmit appeared in 19 games with two starts as a true freshman. He was named to the SoCon All–Freshman Team (media) after averaging 8.2 points and 2.7 rebounds in 22.7 minutes per game. Max scored a season high 15 points in a loss to Chattanooga on February 10, 2021.\n\nSophomore season\nKlesmit started in all 31 games during his sophomore season. He was named to the third team SoCon All–Conference after averaging 14.9 points, 2.8 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 1.6 steals in 31.8 minutes per game. Max scored a season high 27 points twice in a loss at South Carolina on February 23, 2021, and a victory against The Citadel on January 19, 2022. Following the season, Klesmit entered the NCAA transfer portal.\n\nWisconsin\n\nJunior season\nAfter announcing he was entering the transfer portal, Klesmit posted that his top 4 teams were Vanderbilt, Clemson, South Carolina and Colorado State. Despite not being in Klesmit's top 4, the Badgers were able to reengage the in-state product, and in the end, the hometown team won out. Klesmit was able to fill a role after Wisconsin lost guards Brad Davison (graduated) and Johnny Davis was drafted in the first round of the 2022 NBA draft. Klesmit was inserted into the starting lineup for day 1. During a game against Penn State, Klesmit took an inadvertent elbow to his face from Kanya Clary causing Max to get 16 stitches in his lip and cheek. He would be forced to miss the next two games. Klesmit finished the season as the Badgers fifth leading scorer with 8.4 points per game and scored a season high of 19 points twice against Michigan and Purdue in back to back games.\n\nSenior season\nKlesmit is known as the Badgers defensive leader. He is usually tasked with guarding opposing teams top scorers. During parts of his second season with the Badgers, Max has been the go to player when the Badgers need to score.

        "content": "Helen Naomi Heron-Maxwell (25 Jun 1913 - 1983) was a British woman parachutist and glider in the 1930s. She was the first woman glider pilot in the United Kingdom to achieve the Silver-C badge. She promoted gliding and helped to establish gliding clubs. She was a ferry pilot for the Air Transport Auxiliary in the Second World War.\n\nEarly life\n\nHelen Naomi Heron-Maxwell, known as Naomi, was born on 25 June 1913 in Folkestone. She was the daughter of a baronet, Sir Ivor Heron-Maxwell, eighth Baronet, and Lady Heron-Maxwell. She was the second child and second daughter of four children; her younger brother Patrick was the ninth baronet. Her father died in 1928 when Naomi was a teenager. The family had been wealthy, but were less so after his death, and Naomi got a job as a secretary. She \"could not cook, nor sew, and she refused to be presented at court\".\n\nFlying\n\nIn 1934, aged 20, Heron-Maxwell took flying lessons on a Gipsy Moth at Abridge Flying Club, Essex.\n\nAlan Cobham's Flying Circus\n\nHeron-Maxwell joined Alan Cobham's Flying Circus in 1935 as a parachutist. She had met a parachutist, John Tranum, during her flying lessons. \"Sir Alan had heard her on the radio and saw mileage in having a woman parachutist to pull in the crowds. Naomi was equally aware of her marketing potential\". Her mother \"played an April Fools' trick on her, faking a letter from Cobham to say that he \"will no longer be requiring your services owing to what he has read in the papers\"\". Despite this, Heron-Maxwell met Pauline Gower to discuss signing up with Cobham, and got some useful information about terms from Gower.\n\nHer colleagues in the Circus included another woman aviator, Joan Meakin, who was a friend of hers. Heron-Maxwell's reasons for taking the job are variously given as to do \"for fun and the thrill of doing something dangerous\", to show that the parachute is safe and \"no one should hesitate to use it if the emergency arises\", and to earn money. The press called Heron-Maxwell \"the only professional lady parachutist\", \"Britain's only lady parachutist\", \"the girl with the steadiest nerve in Britain\". She lent her name to advertisements for Ovaltine.\n\nHeron-Maxwell made around a hundred parachute jumps. Her colleague Ivor Price was killed in May 1935, when they were jumping from the same aircraft and his parachute did not open. Following this, Heron-Maxwell also had a near-accident following a change of equipment; she had previously used the Russell \"Lobe\" parachute. \"On her first free fall with the new equipment, she succeeded in missing the rip-cord handle, and her very low opening was not appreciated by the management. The crowd had kittens all over the place\". Another colleage, Frederick Marsland, was killed, and Heron-Maxwell's then boyfriend asked her not to perform again. He died in a car crash not long afterwards, and she made no further jumps.\n\nGliding\n\nHeron-Maxwell learnt to glide first in 1936 at Greisheim in Germany, then with Fred Slingsby in a Falcon III, and then in a Buzzard glider at Darmstadt. She was the first British woman to achieve the Silver-C badge. Her final qualification for the certicate came during a flight in which she was lost in cloud for three hours: \"It was great fun outside the cloud, but inside the cloud it was not at all pleasant to be hurled up and down in a thunderstorm without being able to see anything\".\n\nHeron-Maxwell translated Wolf Hirth's Die Hohe Schule des Segelfluges from German as The Art of Soaring Flight, published in 1939.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, she worked as a gliding instructor at clubs including Cambridge University Gliding Club and Yorkshire Gliding Club. She helped to establish Oxford University Gliding Club and gave lectures to promote the foundation of other clubs, such as Bristol Gliding Club. In a lecture at Hull Literary and Philosophical Society, \"With slides, diagrams and film, as well as commentary, lucid and unemotional, she indicated that gliding was a science, based on cool calculation, though always strangely fascinating and, in the ultimate, uncanny\". Heron-Maxwell wrote articles about gliding and gave radio talks. She wrote that \"as [gliding] is one of the few sports where, once the preliminary training is over, men and women compete on a equal basis, neither having an advantage over the other, more and more women are being attracted to it\".\n\nAir Transport Auxiliary\n\nHeron-Maxwell was a ferry pilot in the Air Transport Auxiliary during the Second World War, between 1942 and 1945.\nPersonal life\n\nHeron-Maxwell married Francis Cecil Howard Allen in 1938, but he died the following year. She moved to California, married Howard D Thomas in 1957 and had a child in 1958. She died in 1983.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n Naomi the Aviatrix (2011), publication of Heron-Maxwell's diaries by her son, Nick Thomas\n\nExternal links\n\n Naomi the Aviatrix] (Heron-Maxwell's son's site about her)\n Ladies of Skydiving\n Heron-Maxwell's translation of Soaring\n Helen Naomi Allen at A Fleeting Peace\n\nCategory:1913 births\nCategory:1983 deaths\nCategory:Parachutists\nCategory:English aviators\nCategory:Gliding in England\nCategory:Glider pilots\nCategory:Air Transport Auxiliary pilots\nCategory:British women aviators\nCategory:British flight instructors\nCategory:British skydivers‎\nCategory:British women in World War II",

His daughter Maria was the mother of artist and designer  (1924⁠–⁠1995).Marchegiani.\n\nEducation and career\nthumb|The woods at Villa Cavallini, Lucca, 1914.\nBosso studied at the Istituto di Belle Arti in Vercelli under Andre Bonino and Carlo Costa (1826⁠–⁠1897). At the beginning of his artistic career he dedicated himself to decoration and scenography, carrying out works in palaces, churches and theaters in Italy, France and Switzerland.\n\nIn 1914, at the International Exhibition of Marine and Maritime Hygiene, a world's fair held in Genoa, his large diorama of the Panama Canal received high praise. At this time, he appears to have enjoyed the friendship or patronage of the Piedmontese  family, as suggested by his painting dated 1914 of a lawn chair and parasol nestled in the woods at their villa in Lucca (now Agriturismo Villa Cavallini).\n\nIn 1922, the Esposizione d’Arte Vercellese Moderna held in Vercelli featured a gallery of 47 of his paintings. A label on a painting dated 1924 give Bosso's studio address in Turin as Via Riberi no. 2.\n\nHe had great success with decorative floral still lifes, typically presented in elaborately carved and gilded frames, sometimes circular or oval in shape, and often conceived as paired pendants.\n\nIn museums and collections\nthumb|A Matutino, 1920, Galleria d'arte moderna Ricci Oddi.\nThe Museo del Teatro di Figura in Milan conserves a number of painted stage curtains, backdrops and scenery elements that Bosso designed and created for the city's traditional puppet theaters, beginning in 1900.\n\nHis painting A matutino is in the collection of the Galleria d'arte moderna Ricci Oddi in Piacenza.Arisi, p. 194.Fugazza, p. 27.\n\nHis works are in the collection of the late composer , who was also born in Vercelli  and who wrote of the artist:Known beyond national borders for his skill as a decorator and painter of rich florilegi of Flemish style, Francesco Bosso...gave his best in landscapes, where—more than any other artist from Vercelli—he absorbed influences from beyond the Alps (especially Courbet) and from Antonio Fontanesi.

        "content": "thumb|upright=1.7|Panorama of St. Nicholas Church Square from Ritterstrasse\nThe St. Nicholas Church Square (in German: Nikolaikirchhof) is a square in the city center of Leipzig, Germany. The St. Nicholas Church stands on it. The church and square have particular significance for the Peaceful Revolution of 1989.\nLocation and development \nThe square is bordered in the east by Ritterstrasse and in the west by Nikolaistrasse. That's why only properties on its north and south sides have the address NikolaikirchhofAmtlicher Stadtplan Leipzigs. On the north side is the renovated building of the Alte Nikolaischule (in English: Old school St. Nicholas) with the Museum of Antiquities of Leipzig University, a Richard Wagner museum  considering his childhood and youthHocquél (2023), p. 112 and the Gasthaus Alte Nikolaischule, with outdoor seating in the summer. The second building on the north side is the Predigerhaus (House of the preachers), built in 1886/1887 according to plans by Hugo LichtHocquél (2023), p. 113.\n\nOf the approximately  by  square, around 40% is taken up by the St. Nicholas Church itself. The church stands on the southern half of the square, so that there is only a square on its north side; to the south there is only about the width of the street. Of the commercial buildings adjacent to the south, only one is part of St. Nicholas Church Square. The rest are continuous properties from Grimmaische Strasse.\n\nThe view of the Nikolaikirchhof is limited to the east on Ritterstrasse by the university guest house on the site of the former booksellers' exchange (Buchhändlerbörse) and the Geschwister-Scholl-Haus, and to the west on Nikolaistrasse by Specks Hof and the Motel One.\n History  \nThe history of the square next to the church probably goes back to the church construction that began in the twelfth century. The city charter from 1165/1216 referred to the settlement east of Reichsstrasse (Via Imperii) . With St. Nicholas Church as the center, it formed another settlement focus in early Leipzig, which was a little further to the southeast than the \"Urbs Lipzi\"Hocquél (2023), p. 108. Saint Nicholas was the patron of the merchants who settled here. In terms of the quarterly division of the city area within the city wall, the St. Nicholas quarter (Nikolaiviertel) roughly corresponds to the Grimmaisches QuarterFriedrich Gottlob Leonhardi, Leipzig um 1800, kommentierte und mit einem Register versehene Neuausgabe der Geschichte und Beschreibung der Kreis- und Handelsstadt Leipzig (1799), ed. by Klaus Sohl, Lehmstedt Verlag, Leipzig 2010, ISBN 978-3-942473-03-3, p. 58.\n\nAs far as the St. Nicholas Curch Square is concerned, there is evidence that the school St. Nicholas (Nikolaischule) was built in 1512 after the demolition of a previous houseHorst Riedel: Stadtlexikon Leipzig von A bis Z. PRO LEIPZIG, Leipzig 2005, ISBN 3-936508-03-8, p. 436 (in German). In 1573 a Renaissance fountain was created at the west end of the square, which was replaced by a new fountain in 1657. This is no longer present in pictures from the 19th century.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the north side of the square had been built up with a front of three-story houses for at least 200 years. A residential and commercial building on the western corner was followed by the Nikolaischule, which was only combined with the corner house during the last renovation, which can still be seen in the window structure. Then followed the priest's house, which were replaced by the Predigerhaus.\n\nThe St. Nicholas Church Square acquired particular importance in connection with the events of the Peaceful Revolution of 1989 in Leipzig. In September 1989, the clashes between demonstrators and the state came to a head following the Monday peace prayer in the St. Nicholas Church in the Church Square, as the Monday demonstration was supposed to be nipped in the bud. Most of the arrests took place in the St. Nicholas Church Square until the decisive demonstration took place on 9 October 1989.\n\n Memorial monuments to the Peaceful Revolution  \nIn view of its importance for the peaceful revolution of 1989, several memorial monuments were erected in the St. Nicholas Church Square.\n\nA  tall column was erected on the east side of the square in 1999. It is a replica of the columns within the church and symbolizes how the ideas of departure were carried from the church into the public space. The palm fronds at the top of the column represent the peacefulness of the goals. The column is part of the design with which the Leipzig artist Andreas Stötzner won an international competition to design the square organized by the Leipzig Cultural Foundation Kulturstiftung Leipzig and the city in 1992.Angela Wandelt: Künstlerischer Ideenwettbewerb Nikolaikirchhof, Leipziger Blätter Nr. 22, 1993, p. 50/51 The column was made by the Leipzig sculptor Markus Brille. Two-thirds of the funding comes from donations from citizens, companies and institutions.\n\nThe column includes a memorial plaque embedded in the pavement of the square, also made by Brille, with the inscription “09 OCTOBER 1989” and numerous shoe prints depicting the demonstrationHocquél (2023), p. 111.\n\nA fountain and a light installation followed in 2003 with the support of the Foundation Stiftung Lebendige Stadt. The fountain was designed by the Berlin branch of David Chipperfield Architects. A bowl made of granite from Lausitz with a diameter of  filled to the brim with water symbolizes the political situation in the GDR in 1989, in which “every drop could be the last straw”.\n\nFor the light installation “Public Light” by the artists Tilo Schulz and Kim Worterlkamp, ​​144 lighting elements are embedded in the pavement of the squareHocquél (2023), p. 111, which are switched on randomly in the colors blue, green and magenta within three hours after dark. These points of light represent coming together for a peaceful assembly.\n\n Literature \n \n\n Footnotes \n\n External links \n\n \n\nCategory:Squares in Leipzig\nCategory:Peaceful Revolution",

Construction began in 1880; in 1906 it was inaugurated as the headquarters of the Commercial Association of Rio de Janeiro (Associação Comercial do Rio de Janeiro). In the 1920s, Banco do Brasil acquired the building and converted it into its own headquarters. In 1960, it became the seat of the Central Branch and, later, of the Primeiro de Março Branch.\n\nLaunched on October 12, 1989, CCBB RJ was idealized in 1986 during the presidency of Camilo Calazans de Magalhães at Banco do Brasil. It was the first museum opened in the CCBB network. The renovation project preserved the elegance of the columns, the ornaments and the marble that ascends the stairs from the lobby, and involved work on the dome over the rotunda. Subsequently, other centers inaugurated in the cities of Belo Horizonte (2013), Brasília (2000) and São Paulo (2001).\n\n Features \nInside the building, the CCBB RJ occupies 15,046 square meters out of a total constructed area of 19,243 square meters. The structure includes different spaces such as: rooms for exhibitions on the first and second floors; a 110-seat cinema on the first floor; a 53-seat room for video screenings on the mezzanine; three theaters, one on the first floor with 175 seats, and two more on the second floor, one with 158 seats and the other without fixed seats for alternative shows; a 90-seat auditorium on the fourth floor; and a library on the fifth floor.\n\n Gallery \n\n See also \n\n Banco do Brasil Cultural Center\n Cultural center\n\n References \n\n External links \n\n CCBB Rio de Janeiro's official website (in Portuguese)\n\nCategory:Tourist attractions in Rio de Janeiro (city)\nCategory:Museums in Rio de Janeiro (state)\nCategory:1989 establishments in Brazil\nCategory:Art museums and galleries in Brazil\nCategory:Cultural centers in Brazil\nCategory:Museums established in 1989\nCategory:Arts organisations based in Brazil",

Tapley secured funds from the General Education Board for  a chapel and a science building. The school dedicated three buildings, Bessie Strong Hall,  Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Building, and Tapley Hall, named in Tapley's honor in 1925.

        "content": "Helianthemum almeriense, also known as jarilla, mata turmera or tormera in Spanish, is a very branched woody plant of the Cistaceae family, with showy white flowers, which blooms in winter and spring.\nthumb|Detail of the flower.\nthumb|View of the plant.\n\n Description \nPerennial plant, 8-60 cm high, fruticose, intricately branched; more or less tortuous vine, generally divaricate branches. Stems patent, divaricate, rarely erect-ascending, glabrous to incano-tomentose, reddish-brown. Leaves elliptic to oblong-lanceolate or linear-lanceolate, rarely suborbicular, obtuse, flat or more rarely with somewhat revolute margin, glabrous to sparsely stellate-pubescent on the upper side, and glabrous underside, more rarely stellate-pubescent or tomentose, and with lateral veins generally not very prominent; blade 2-18 by 0.6-4 mm; stipules up to 2-3.5 mm, shorter or longer than petiole, subulate or triangular-subulate, apex often piliferous, glabrous or more or less hairy, green. Inflorescence simple, somewhat lax, 2-10-flowered. \n\nFlower buds ovoid-conical, acute, with distinctly twisted apex. Inner sepals 4-8 mm -from 5-8.5 mm in fruiting-, obliquely ovate-elliptic, subobtuse, membranaceous, glabrous, less frequently stellate-pubescent, generally purplish, with intercostal spaces about 1 mm in maximum width, and prominently ribbed, rarely setose; outer sepals linear-spatulate to elliptic, about 1/3 as long as inner sepals, glabrous or glabrescent, greenish. Petals 6-12 mm, obovate-flabeliform, somewhat wrinkled, sometimes retuse, white, more rarely pinkish, maculate. Fruit in capsule 4.5-7 mm, similar or shorter in length than the calyx, globose or ellipsoidal, densely hairy, polyspermous. Seeds 1.2-1.5 mm, brownish brown or dark reddish brown.\n\n Habitat and distribution \nIn thyme fields and cleared places, in dry, stony, limestone, micaceous, loamy soils or in gypsum wastelands, sometimes also in volcanic soils and even in sandy soils (beaches); from sea level up to 1200 m altitude. Arid southeast of the Iberian Peninsula; it has also been cited from Morocco, where its presence would need to be confirmed.\n\n Ecology \nIts presence is related to that of a mycorrhizal fungus: Terfezia claveryi or turma, which is of the so-called desert truffles (fam. Terfeziaceae), subterranean and edible, of culinary interest and as food for livestock. This characteristic is translated into some of the vernacular names of the species - and others of the genus Helianthemum, such as Mata turmera and Tormera (in Spanish).\n\n Taxonomy \nHelianthemum almeriense was described by Carlos Pau Español and published in Mem. Mus. Ci. Nat. Barcelona, Ser. Bot. i. No. 3, 11 (1925).\n\n Etymology \n\n Helianthemum: generic name derived from the ancient Greek Ἥλιος (Helios), \"the Sun\" and ανθεμοζ, ον (anthemos, on), \"flowered\", since the flowers only open with the heat of the sun (they need a temperature above 20 °C to unfold their petals) and have a certain positive phototropism. Certain vernacular names in Spanish, such as Mirasol, would corroborate this interpretation. Authors argue that its name is due to the resemblance of the yellow flowers with the sun; however many species are white, orange, pink or purple, which does not fit with this interpretation. Others for the affection that the genus would have for sunny places.\n almeriense: geographic epithet that alludes to its location in Almería.\n\n Infraspecific taxa \n\n Helianthemum almeriense var. scopulorum (Rouy) Losa & Rivas Goday\n\n Synonymy \n\n Helianthemum almeriense subsp. scopulorum (Rouy) Rivas Mart. & al.\n Helianthemum almeriense var. almerianum Losa & Rivas Goday\n Helianthemum almeriense var. minutifolium Rigual ex O.Bolòs & Vigo\n\n Helianthemum eulaliae var. foliosum Sennen\n Helianthemum eulaliae Sennen\n Helianthemum leptophyllum f. psilosepalum Willk.\n Helianthemum leptophyllum f. squarrosum Grosser in Engl.\n Helianthemum leptophyllum subsp. almeriense (Pau) Sagredo & Malag. in Malag.\n Helianthemum leptophyllum subsp. scopulorum (Rouy) Sagredo & Malag. in Malag.\n Helianthemum psilosepalum (Willk.)

        "content": "Phyllis Broughton born Phyllis Harriet Wright became Phyllis Harriet Thomson (1862 – 21 July 1926) was a British dancer and actress who was known as Gaiety Girl\n\nLife\nBroughton was born in 90 Hercules Buildings on Hercules Road in Lambeth. Her parents were Emily Charlotte, (born Jecks) and William Wright and she was the first of their four children. Her career was an unusual choice for a girl from a good family. Her father was a clerk to an architect in the 1870s and she was training to dance at the Neville Dramatic School and studying ballet. She adopted the name Phyllis Broughton when she made her debut at the Canterbury Music Hall in London in March 1877.\n\nThe manager of the Gaiety Theatre, John Hollingshead, employed her as part of his company in 1880. The theatre was known for its chorus of girls, daring ad-libs (that avoided censorship) and the costumes that the girls wore. The Gaiety had a quartet of leading actors Nellie Farren, Kate Vaughan, Edward O'Connor Terry, and E. W. Royce. Kate Vaughan made her last appearance at the Gaiety in 1883, before she married, and soon gave up dancing. This allowed Broughton to take over her roles. In 1884 she was promoted from the chorus to play roles in the theatre's adaptions of stories from One Thousand and One Nights. She gathered her own following, and her own skirts, for her version of the skirt-dance as she appeared in Whittington and His Cat, Aladdin, Little Robin Hood, Blue Beard (1883), and Camaralzaman in 1884. She became a \"Gaiety Girl\" who made a fortune from her success. Her name was associated with that term after she played Lady Virginia in A Gaiety Girl in 1893.  \n\nHer father died in 1883 and her mother gave birth to another child name Haidee. Her mother would later marry Haidee's father in 1888 and General Coote Synge-Hutchinson became her step father. He brought the police to her aid when she began to receive threats amongst her fan mail. \n\nIn 1888 she sued Viscount Dangan for breach of promise. He had asked her to marry him and then he changed his mind. His lawyers agreed damages of £2,500 and they made assurances that the break up was not a reflection on her character. Viscount Dargan went on to marry another in 1889.\n\nBroughon herself broke off her own engagement in 1889 to John Hedley who had prepared a home, Long for her to live. It was said that he employed over a dozen gardners to keep that house in good order. Hedley sent gifts every week to Broughton until she died and even after that he was devoted to her.\n\nShe married in 1917 to a doctor from Margate and she did not appear again on stage. She had been living in Margate for twenty years after she bought \"the best house in Margate\", India House. The house had been bought by her step father on her behalf and he owned it for just a month.\n\nDeath and legacy\nBroughton died in Marylebone following an operation in 1926. She left £230,000 in her will and her jewellery was auctioned in the following year and it sold for £36,000. India House was owned by a firm of solicitors in 2017. John Hedley continued as her admirer until he died in 1936 near Lake Windermere. He left £655,129 and Broughton was to receive any unallocated monies. The house that Hedley had prepared for them became a home for elderly actors.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1862 births\nCategory:1926 deaths\nCategory:People from Lambeth\nCategory:Dancers",

        "content": "The Yazīd inscription is an early Christian Paleo-Arabic inscription from the region of as-Samrūnīyyāt, 12 km southeast of Qasr Burqu' in the northeastern Jordan. \n\nIt was discovered during in the first season of the El-Khḍerī archaeological and epigraphic survey project and published in 2017. It consists of only four words and a Christian cross. Notably, it mentions a certain figure known as \"Yazīd the king\" (yzydw ʾl-mlk), who is most likely the the Umayyad ruler Yazid I.\n\n Text \nThe following transliteration and translation comes from the 2017 edition of the Yazid inscription.Transliteration\n1. † dkr ʾl-ʾlh\n2. yzydw ʾl-mlk\nTranslation\n\n1. †May God be mindful of\n\n2. Yazīd-w the king\n\n Identity of Yazid \nThe identity of the figure named Yazīd in the inscription is open to interpretation, especially in light of the undated nature of the inscription. First, the term mlk (malik) in inscriptions from this period does not necessarily denote a king who ruled over a specified territory. For example, the Jebel Usays inscription applies the title to al-Harith ibn Jabalah, ruler of the Ghassanids, possibly in reference to the title he had been given of phylarch by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I. If the figure mentioned in the inscription corresponds to one from known sources, it may refer to Yazīd son of al-ʾAswad (the only figure from classical Arabic sources by the name of Yazīd associated with the Ghassanids), Yazīd son of Qays the Ḥujrid (mentioned by Photios I of Constantinople mentioned in his Bibliotheca), or Yazīd son of Kabaśat (mentioned in the the late Sabaic inscription CIH 541 as a figure appointed by the South Arabian ruler Abraha). From the Islamic period, it may refer to the Umayyad ruler Yazid I, a view that is increasingly held.\n\n Interpretation \nThe formula which appears in the inscription, dkr ʾl-ʾlh (\"May God be mindful of\" or \"May God remember\"), is also found in the Zabad inscription and DaJ144PAr.\n\nThe Yazid inscription shares a few linguistic peculiarities with the Abd Shams inscription.\n\nThe Yazid inscription is one of the two Islamic-era inscriptions that retain the practice of wawation, once widespread in pre-Islamic Arabic, alongside PERF 558 (22 AH / 643 CE).\n\n See also \n\n Namara inscription\n Yazid I\n\n References \n\nCategory:Arabic inscriptions\nCategory:History of the Arabic language\nCategory:Jordan",

His father was Lawrence (I), the first member of the family, himself a son of Andrew Kaplon. His mother was an unidentified daughter of a certain magister Kakas.Engel: Genealógia (Genus Kaplon 7., Nagymihály branch) George had three brothers: Peter, Ladislaus \"the Devil\" and Nicholas. The latter two were ancestors of the Ördög (also Vajnatinai, later Tibai) and Lucskai families, respectively.Engel: Genealógia (Genus Kaplon 8., Tibai branch)Engel: Genealógia (Genus Kaplon 9., Lucskai branch)\n\nThe name of George first appears in contemporary records in 1335. In that year, he contested the land division between various members of the Nagymihály branch. Thereafter, his second cousins agreed to a new division among the branch's landholdings in 1336. The agreement was legally confirmed by Palatine William Drugeth in 1337. Thereafter, Lawrence and his sons mainly resided in Tiba in Ung County (present-day Tibava, Slovakia), adopting their family name after the settlement. Despite the land division, relationship remained tense between members of the branch. In 1343, George and his brothers, Ladislaus and Nicholas protested against that their cousins, John II and Ernye (sons of Jakó IV) refused to hand over the estate Gelénes in Szatmár County to them, despite the 1336 agreement. George lost a lawsuit for the estate Reviscse (today Blatné Revištia, Slovakia) in 1344. In the same year, there were also disputes regarding the borders of Tiba, Reviscse, Simonháza, Zalacska (today Zalužice, Slovakia) and Jeszenő (today Jasenov, Slovakia) between the families of the Nagymihály branch. Judge royal Paul Nagymartoni ruled against George, Nicholas and Ladislaus in this litigation too.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n \n \n \n\nCategory:1370 deaths\nCategory:14th-century Hungarian people\nCategory:Kaplon (genus)",

However, some regions have their own native species of flowering cherry trees, a notable variety of which is Prunus cerasoides.\n\n Australia \n\nthumb|Panoramic view from the Symbolic Mountain at the Cowra Japanese Garden and Cultural Centre\n\nDuring World War II, a prisoner of war (POW) camp near the town of Cowra in New South Wales, Australia, was the site of one of the largest prison escapes of the war, on 5 August 1944. During the Cowra breakout and the subsequent rounding up of POWs, four Australian soldiers and 231 Japanese soldiers died and 108 prisoners were wounded. The Japanese War Cemetery holding the dead from the breakout was tended after the war by members of the Cowra RSL and ceded to Japan in 1963. In 1971 the Cowra Tourism Development decided to celebrate this link to Japan and proposed a Japanese garden for the town. The Japanese government agreed to support this development as a sign of thanks for the respectful treatment of their war dead; the development also received funding from the Australian government and private entities.Tam, Tracy, \"Australian town commemorates 1944 POW camp breakout\", The Japan Times, (Kyodo News), 19 August 2014\n\nThe garden was designed by Ken Nakajima (1914–2000), a world-renowned designer of Japanese gardens at the time. The first stage was opened in 1979, and the second stage in 1986. The gardens were designed in the style of the Edo period and are a kaiyū-shiki or strolling garden. They are designed to show all of the landscape types of Japan. At five hectares (12 acres), the Cowra Japanese Garden is the largest Japanese garden in the Southern Hemisphere. An annual cherry blossom festival during September is now a major event in Cowra's tourism calendar.\n\n Brazil \n\nthumb|Cherry blossom in Praça do Japão (Japan Square), Curitiba, Brazil\n\nWith the Japanese diaspora to Brazil, many immigrants brought seedlings of cherry trees. In São Paulo State, home to the largest Japanese community outside Japan, it is common to find them in Japan-related facilities and in home gardens, usually the cultivars Prunus serrulata 'Yukiwari' and Prunus serrulata var. lannesiana 'Himalaya'. Some cities, such as Garça and Campos do Jordão, have annual festivals to celebrate the blooming of the trees and Japanese culture. In Parana State (in southern Brazil), cities also received many of these immigrants, who planted trees in Apucarana, Maringá, and Cascavel, and especially in the capital city of Curitiba.\n\nIn the Curitiba, the first seedlings were brought by Japanese immigrants in the first half of the 20th century, and large numbers were planted in the 1990s with the opening of the Botanical Garden of Curitiba. Nowadays, seedlings are produced locally and used in afforestation of streets and squares. In Praça do Japão (Japan Square) there are more than 30 cherry trees that were sent by the Japanese Empire to Curitiba.\n\n Canada \n\nthumb|Cherry blossoms in Canada, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario\n\nVancouver, British Columbia, is famous for its thousands of cherry trees (estimated 50,000) lining many streets and in many parks, including Queen Elizabeth Park and Stanley Park. Vancouver holds the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival every year. With multiple varieties and a temperate climate, they begin to bloom in February yearly and peak in April. In 2022, this outdoor festival of arts and culture from many communities ran from April 1 to 23.\n\nHigh Park in Toronto, Ontario, features many Somei-Yoshino cherry trees that were given to Toronto by Japan in 1959. Through the Sakura Project, the Japanese Consulate donated a further 34 cherry trees to High Park in 2001, plus cherry trees to various other locations like Exhibition Place, McMaster University, York University (near Calumet College and on Ottawa Road near McLaughlin College) and the University of Toronto's main campus (next to Robarts Library) and Scarborough campus. Niagara Falls has many trees near the falls themselves. Royal Botanical Gardens in Burlington and Hamilton was also the recipient of several Somei-Yoshino cherry trees donated as part of the Sakura Project. The trees are located in the Arboretum and the Rock Garden and were planted to celebrate the continual strengthening of friendship between Japan and Canada. Peak bloom time at the Royal Botanical Gardens is normally around the last week of April or the first week of May.\n\n China \n\nthumb|Longwangtang Cherry Blossom Park in Liaoning, China\n\nCherry trees grow naturally in the middle northern and southern parts of China, where they are known as yinghua () in Chinese. During the Tang Dynasty, Japan diplomatic groups brought the cherry blossom back to Japan from China, coinciding with the shift away from ume blossom viewing in the Japanese Heian period. The identity of the original cultivators of the cherry blossom around this time has been the subject of debate.\n\nHowever, some of the most famous cherry blossom parks in China reflect Japan's brief occupation of parts of China during the first half of the 20th century or donations from Japan.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, twenty-eight cherry blossom trees were planted at Wuhan University by Japanese troops. After the war it was decided that the trees would be preserved despite their historical implications. In 1972, as China-Japan relations normalized, about 800 trees were donated to Wuhan University. Other donations added to their numbers in the following years. Currently, Wuhan University has about one thousand cherry blossom trees of different kinds. 80% of these cherry trees are direct descendants of trees planted by the Japanese. In 2020, when cherry blossom viewing became impossible due to the spread of COVID-19, updates on the flowering of cherry trees at Wuhan University were posted on the Web and viewed a total of 750 million times.Nobuhiko Tanaka (2021) Why do Chinese people come to view cherry blossoms?

In 1973, the year following the Japan–China Joint Communiqué, Japan sent cherry trees to China as a symbol of friendship, and they were planted in Yuyuantan Park in Beijing. After that, further trees were propagated and planted, and the park became famous for cherry blossoms.Wuhan City delegation to learns about cherry blossom management in Hirosaki Park.

In 2016 Wuhan City and Hirosaki City signed a friendship agreement. East Lake Cherry Blossom Park opened in 2001, and 2.5 million people came to see the blossoms in 2018.

Cherry blossoms promote friendship between China and Japan. Agence France-Presse. March 27, 2019\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the popularity of cherry blossoms in China rapidly increased due to an increase in the number of visitors to Japan and the spread of SNS, and many cherry blossom parks have opened throughout China. According to statistics from 2019, the number of cherry blossom-related tourists reached 340 million and the amount spent exceeded 60 billion yuan.\n\nSome notable cherry blossom sites in China include:\n\n Longwangtang Cherry Blossom Park in Lushun, Dalian, Liaoning\n East Lake Cherry Blossom Park near Wuhan University, in Donghu District, Wuhan, Hubei\n Wuhan University, in Donghu District, Wuhan, Hubei\n Nanshan Botanical Garden in Nan'an District, Chongqing\n Pingba Cherry Blossom Park in Guizhou\n Yuantouzhu in Wuxi\n\n France \n\nthumb|Blooming cherry blossom trees in Parc de Sceaux, France\n\nParc de Sceaux, located in a suburb of Paris, has two orchards of cherry trees, one for white cherry blossoms (Prunus avium) and one for pink cherry blossoms (Prunus serrulata). Orchard detail on interactive map The orchards combined make up 264 trees, which attract many visitors when they bloom in early April. Additional plantings are present in the capital along the Seine River, near Notre-Dame de Paris, and in the Bastille area.\n\n Germany \n\nCherry blossoms are a major tourist attraction in Germany's Altes Land orchard region. The largest Hanami in Germany, organized by the German-Japanese society, with Japanese-style fireworks, draws tens of thousands of spectators to Hamburg every spring.\n\nIn 1990, Japan donated cherry blossoms to be planted along prior sections of the Berlin Wall, to express appreciation for the German reunification. The gift was supported by donations from the Japanese people allowing over 9,000 trees to be planted. The first trees were planted in November of that year near the Glienicke Bridge.\n\nThe Cherry Blossom festival in the Bonn Altstadt () is also very famous.\n\nStarting in 2015, Hamburg was allowed to bestow the title of \"Cherry Blossom Queen\" by the Japan Cherry Blossom Association, one of only three cities worldwide to receive this privilege. The first Cherry Blossom Queen of Hamburg was crowned by the Cherry Blossom Queen of Japan on 23 May 2015.\n\n India \n\nthumb| Prunus cerasoides is a species of wild Himalayan cherry tree, common in India.\n\nIn India, cherry blossoms are a notable attraction in Himalayan states like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Sikkim and northern districts of West Bengal, namely Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling, as well as Nagaland, Manipur and the tropical highlands of Garo Hills and Khasi Hills in Meghalaya, where Prunus cerasoides is native. These states are notable for Prunus cerasoides trees, called wild cherry blossom trees, which cover the Himalayan foothills and bloom twice a year during the spring and autumn months. They can also be seen in various British-era botanical gardens, especially in the Nilgiri Hills in the Western Ghats in southern India.Prunus cerasoides by Divya Chandran, 2019 https://thepapyrus.in/index.php/sakura-magic-in-the-nilgiris-wild-cherry-blossom-pollachi-papyrus/ The flowers bloom every six months, between January and late March, and between late September and November.\n\nPrunus cerasoides, called wild Himalayan cherry, Indian wild cherry, and sour cherry, is known in Hindi as padam, pajja, or padmakashtha. Among Hindus in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, it is considered sacred and associated with Vishnu and Shiva.Trees In Indian Art Mythology And Folklore, Bansi Lal Malla (2000), p.56 During Maha Shivaratri, the leaves are used to make a wreath with wild citrus fruits, which is hung at the prayer altar. The leaves are also used as incense.\n\nSome cherry blossom festivals are held in India during October–November, when Prunus cerasoides blooms. Shillong is notable for its cherry blossom festival during the autumn.\n\n Indonesia \n\nIn Indonesia, cherry blossoms can be found in the Cibodas Botanical Garden in West Java. These trees are of the Prunus cerasoides species. Cibodas Botanical Garden belongs to the tropical rain forest climate, and the trees begin to flower in January, followed by full flowering in February, and the flowers start to fall in March. The second flowering period begins in June and peaks in August, and the flowers fall in October.\n\n Korea \n\nthumb|Cherry blossoms at POSTECH in South Korea\n\nCherry trees have been used in Korea in making bows and woodblocks (Palman Daejanggyeong). According to tradition, monks used wood from silver magnolias, white birches, and cherry trees from the Southern coast of the peninsula for these purposes. The Japanese planted Yoshino cherry trees at Seoul's Changgyeonggung Palace during Japanese rule. Cherry blossom viewing festivals continued in Korea even after the Japanese surrendered at the end of WWII, but they have been controversial, and many cherry trees were cut down to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Japanese surrender, as they were seen as symbols of the occupation.Ohnuki-Tierney, Emiko. Kamikaze, Cherry Blossoms, and Nationalisms. 2002, page 122-3. Even still, Koreans continue to plant cherry trees and festivals attract a wide range of tourists, and cherry blossoms in Korea are associated with purity and beauty.\n\nFrom the start of the 21st century, there have been disputes related to assertations that the Yoshino cherry is the same species as a Korean indigenous, endangered species called the King cherry, whose mass cultivation was being studied at the time. In 2007, a genetic analysis comparing King cherry and Yoshino cherry trees concluded that the trees are distinct species, and in 2016, another DNA study suggested independent origins of the King cherry and Yoshino cherry. Later that year, the new scientific name Cerasus × nudiflora was given to the King cherry to distinguish it from the Yoshino cherry (Prunus × yedoensis).\n\nIn Korea, most of the sites for cherry blossom festivals, including Yeouido and Jinhae, are still planted with Yoshino cherry trees. According to the results of a survey published in 2022, most of the cherry trees planted in the National Assembly area and Yeouido, two of the capital's most famous cherry blossom viewing spots, were Japanese Yoshino cherry trees, including 90.4% of the cherry trees in the National Assembly area and 96.4% in Yeouido, and none were Korean King cherry trees. Based on the results of this survey, King Cherry Project 2050, an incorporated association, plans to gradually replace Yoshino cherry trees with King cherry by around 2050. In addition, more than 90% of the cherry trees in Jinhae, famous for its cherry blossom festival, are Yoshino cherry trees, imported from Japan in the 1960s, and many others have been found to be Japanese weeping cherry trees. It has been suggested that these also be replaced with the King cherry.\n\n Myanmar \n\nCherry blossoms are found in the temperate regions of Myanmar. The town Pyin Oo Lwin, known as \"The Land of Cherries\", is famous for its cherry blossoms during the spring. Some cherry trees, genetically modified to be able to survive in the tropical climate, were also planted in Yangon, the commercial capital, as part of a friendship program with Japan.\n\n Netherlands \n\nthumb|Cherry blossoms in the Amsterdamse Bos\n\nIn the year 2000, the Japan Women's Club (JWC) donated 400 cherry blossom trees to the city of Amstelveen. The trees have been planted in the cherry blossom park in the Amsterdamse Bos. Every tree has a name — 200 trees have female Japanese names, and 200 trees have female Dutch names. At the annual April event, JWC members wear kimono and celebrate the cherry blossoms in the park.\n\n New Zealand \n\nthumb|Cherry blossoms and water wheel in Hagley Park\n\nHagley Park is the largest urban open space in Christchurch, New Zealand and has many cherry blossom trees of several varieties.\nAston Norwood Gardens, north of Wellington, has the largest number of Prunus × yedoensis cherry blossom trees in New Zealand.\n\n Spain \n\n is a cherry blossom festival that takes place annually in Valle del Jerte, in the province of Cáceres, Extremadura. More than 1500 cherry fruit trees bloom in the valley between approximately March 15 and April 10, starting with trees lower down in the valley. The flowers last about 10 days. During the week when the flowers are in bloom, the eleven villages in the valley celebrate their historical and current culture, gastronomy, and architecture. Traditional homes, forges, and wine cellars open their doors to the public. It has been designated a Fiesta of National Tourist Interest.\n\nThe village of Alfarnate in Andalusia (near Málaga) is known for its cherry orchards, and holds a cherry festival (Festival de la Cereza) each year in June. The village noticed that people from the Japanese community in Spain were visiting in April to view the cherry blossoms, and in 2022 they decided to hold their first cherry blossom festival. The Sakura Alfernate festival was expanded in 2023, with the backing of the Japanese embassy, to include lectures on sakura and Japanese culture, and workshops and demonstrations of Japanese art, music, and martial arts. The 2023 festival was held on April 15 and 16. Along with its 4000 cherry fruit trees, the village has a garden of 47 cherry blossom trees.\n\n Taiwan \n\nTypically found in mountainous areas, cherry blossoms are a popular attraction in Taiwan, with numerous specially tailored viewing tours. Among the most easily accessible and thus most popular locations for viewing them are Yangmingshan, in Taipei, and Wuling Farm, in Taichung.\n\n Thailand \n\nNative wild cherry blossoms of the species Prunus cerasoides are found in Northern Thailand, in addition to growing throughout the Himalayas. Over 100,000 trees of this species were planted in 2010 in Phu Hin Rong Kla National Park, at the mountainous region of Phu Lom Lo, a grassland previously used for farming cabbages.\n\n Turkey \n\nthumb|Cherry blossoms in Ankara, Turkey\n\nIn 2005, Japanese cherry trees were presented by Japan to the Nezahat Gökyiğit Botanical Garden in Istanbul, Turkey. Each tree represents one sailor of the frigate Ertugrul, a famous frigate of the Ottoman Turkish navy which sank on the way back from a goodwill visit to Japan in 1890 due to a typhoon. 587 Ottoman Turkish sailors were lost, but the Japanese Coast Guard saved 67 sailors, and their return to Turkey formed the foundation for the relationship between the two countries. The Japanese cherry trees represent the memory of those who died and provide annual remembrance.\n\n United Kingdom \n\nFrom the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Collingwood Ingram collected and studied Japanese cherry blossoms and created various cultivars such as Okame and Kursar. Ingram's work allowed , a cultivar that had disappeared in Japan in the early 20th century, to return to Japan.Toshio Katsuki. (2018) Sakura no Kagaku (Science of Cherry Blossoms). pp.166–169 SB Creative. Toshio Katsuki. (2015) Sakura. pp.119–123 Iwanami Shoten. \n\nCherry trees are widely cultivated in public and private gardens throughout the UK, where the climate is well suited to them. Batsford Arboretum in Gloucestershire, England holds the national collection of Japanese village cherries in the Sato-zakura Group. Keele University in Staffordshire, England has one of the UK's largest collections of flowering cherries, with more than 150 varieties. The Royal Horticultural Society has given its prestigious Award of Garden Merit to many flowering cherry species and cultivars.\n\nIn March 2020, in the first national lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the National Trust initiated the #BlossomWatch campaign, inspired by cherry blossom festivals in Japan. The campaign encouraged people to share images of the first signs of Spring, in particular blossoms, on lockdown walks. The campaign was repeated in 2021 and 2022.\n\n United States \n\nthumb|upright|Cherry blossoms in Washington, D.C.\n\nEliza Ruhamah Scidmore introduced the idea of planting Japanese cherry trees in Washington, D.C., a vision that became a reality in 1912. Japan gave 3,020 flowering cherry trees as a gift to the United States in 1912 to celebrate the growing friendship between the two countries, replacing an earlier gift of 2,000 trees that had to be destroyed due to disease in 1910. These trees were planted in Sakura Park in New York, and lined the shore of the Tidal Basin and the roadway in East Potomac Park in Washington, D.C. The first two original trees were planted by the first lady Helen Taft and Viscountess Chinda on the bank of the Tidal Basin. The gift was renewed with another 3,800 trees in 1965.Jefferson, Roland M. and Alan F. Fusonie. (1977). \"The Japanese Flowering Cherry Trees of Washington, D.C.: A Living Symbol of Friendship. National Arboretum Contribution No. 4.\" Washington: USDA, Agricultural Research Service. In Washington, D.C. the cherry blossom trees continue to be a popular tourist attraction (and the subject of the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival) when they reach full bloom in early spring. Just outside of Washington, the suburb of Kenwood in Bethesda, Maryland, has roughly 1,200 trees, which are popular with locals and tourists.\n\nNew Jersey's Branch Brook Park, which is maintained by Essex County, is the oldest county park in the United States and is home to the largest collection of cherry blossom trees in one US location, with about 5,000.\n\nBalboa Park in San Diego has 1,000 cherry blossom trees that blossom in mid- to late March. In Los Angeles, over 2,000 trees are located at Lake Balboa in Van Nuys. These trees were donated by a Japanese benefactor, and were planted in 1992; however, the trees in this area have been dying off due to drought conditions.\n\nPhiladelphia is home to over 2,000 flowering Japanese cherry trees, half of which were a gift from the Japanese government in 1926 in honor of the 150th anniversary of American independence, with the other half planted by the Japan America Society of Greater Philadelphia between 1998 and 2007. Philadelphia's cherry blossoms are located within Fairmount Park, and the annual Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival of Greater Philadelphia celebrates the blooming trees. The University of Washington in Seattle also has cherry blossoms in its quadrangle.\n\nThe Japanese American Historical Plaza located in Tom McCall Waterfront Park in Portland, Oregon has one hundred cherry blossoms in the park, which were planted during the construction of the park in 1990.\n\nOther US cities have an annual cherry blossom festival (or sakura matsuri), including the International Cherry Blossom Festival in Macon, Georgia, which features over 300,000 cherry trees. The Brooklyn Botanic Garden in New York City also has a large, well-attended festival. Portsmouth, New Hampshire is the site of the peace conference that produced the Treaty of Portsmouth, for which the original Washington, D.C. cherry trees were given in thanks. Several cherry trees planted on the bank of the tidal pond next to Portsmouth City Hall were the gift of Portsmouth's Japanese sister city of Nichinan—the hometown of Marquis Komura Jutarō, Japan's representative at the conference. Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, has 200 somei yoshino trees, a gift from its sister institution, Japan's Chubu University.\n\n Vietnam \n\nIn Vietnam, cherry blossoms are scarce, concentrated mainly in the northern mountainous provinces and the Central Highlands. These trees are mainly of the kanhizakura variety. In Da Lat, there is a type of cherry blossom belonging to the kanhizakura x okamezakura variety, scientifically named prunus cerasoides, commonly known as mai anh dao, wild mai, or cherry blossom. In 2013, the Japanese government gifted Vietnam a number of cherry blossom trees to commemorate the cooperative relationship between the two countries. These cherry trees from Japan were planted at the Japanese Embassy on Lieu Giai Street, Hanoi, and in Sapa. In 2019, some cherry trees gifted by Japan bloomed in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n References \n\nCategory:Cherry blossom",

        "content": "In August 1896, Chattanooga Times publisher Adolph Ochs acquired The New-York Times, implementing significant alterations to the newspaper's structure. Ochs established the Times as a merchant's newspaper and removed the hyphen from the newspaper's name. In 1905, The New York Times opened Times Tower, marking expansion. The Times experienced a political realignment in the 1910s amid several disagreements within the Republican Party. The New York Times reported on the sinking of the Titanic as other newspapers were cautious about bulletins from the Associated Press. Through managing editor Carr Van Anda, the Times focused on scientific advancements, reporting on Albert Einstein's then-unknown theory of general relativity and becoming involved in the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. In April 1935, Ochs died, leaving his son-in-law Arthur Hays Sulzberger as publisher. The Great Depression forced Sulzberger to reduce The New York Timess operations, and developments in the New York newspaper landscape resulted in the formation of larger newspapers, such as the New York Herald Tribune and the New York World-Telegram. In contrast to Ochs, Sulzberger encouraged wirephotography.\n\nThe New York Times extensively covered World War II through large headlines, reporting on exclusive stories such as the Yugoslav coup d'état. Amid the war, Sulzberger began expanding the Timess operations further, acquiring WQXR-FM in 1944—the first non-Times investment since the Jones era—and established a fashion show in Times Hall. Despite reductions as a result of conscription, The New York Times retained the largest journalism staff of any newspaper. The Timess print edition became available internationally during the war through the Army & Air Force Exchange Service; The New York Times Overseas Weekly later became available in Japan through The Asahi Shimbun and in Germany through the Frankfurter Zeitung. The international edition would develop into a separate newspaper. Journalist William L. Laurence publicized the atomic bomb race between the United States and Germany, resulting in the Federal Bureau of Investigation seizing copies of the Times. The United States government recruited Laurence to document the Manhattan Project in April 1945. Laurence became the only witness of the Manhattan Project, a detail realized by employees of The New York Times following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.\n\n1896–1900: Ochs's purchase and revitalization\nthumb|upright|right|In 1896, Chattanooga Times publisher Adolph Ochs purchased The New-York Times.\nIn May 1895, Chattanooga Times publisher Adolph Ochs considered purchasing the New York Mercury, a dying Democratic publication that supported the free silver movement, at the behest of his acquaintance Leopold Wallach. Ochs was still recovering from the panic of 1893 and did not want to build up another newspaper business in the South; a deal for the Nashville American fell through. Wallach was a noted opponent of free silver but befriended some of the \"silver senators\" who built the Mercury into a Democratic organ. Likewise, Ochs supported the gold standard, as did the Chattanooga Times. By the fall of 1875, Ochs was actively interested in purchasing the New York Mercury but stipulated that he must have control over its editorial content. He thoroughly examined the paper's plant and financials. The deal fell through in March 1896 after the Mercurys owners included a clause allowing them to vacate the plant and after Ochs discovered that the United Press was unwilling to transfer publishers.\n\nOn March 12, 1896—his 38th birthday—Ochs received a telegram from Harry Alloway, a member of The New-York Timess Wall Street staff. Alloway, who had previously met him at a trip to Tennessee in 1890, informed Ochs of the Timess situation and proposed that he should purchase the paper. Chicago Times-Herald publisher H. H. Kohlsaat convinced him that he would have the caliber to run The New-York Times, and, after talking with stockholder Sam Thomas and Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company founder Charles Ranlett Flint, Alloway gave Ochs the opportunity to purchase the Times if he ran it for at least a year without incurring debt. After hearing that Alloway persuaded Thomas and Flint, Wallach became as eager as Ochs was. Ochs began meeting with other figures, including Charles Ransom Miller, Flint, and Spencer Trask. Flint and Trask developed a plan to reorganize the company, but it required more money than Ochs could provide. A portion of stockholders believed that The New-York Times should consolidate with The New York Recorder to form the Times-Recorder Company. Efforts to consolidate the two companies fell through after Miller and Edward Cary put the Times into the receivership of Alfred Ely, who doubted Ochs's ability to stave off Hearst, Pulitzer, and James Gordon Bennett Jr., but had a change of heart upon meeting with him.\n\nRumors in Printing House Square began circulating, with the most prominent stating that Wall Street would control The New-York Times with Ochs at the helm. The rumor cited J. P. Morgan and August Belmont's ownership of  () in debenture. In mid-June 1896, stockholders accepted Ochs's plan to form a new company with a capital of 10,000 shares worth  (). As a persuasive, Ochs offered fifteen shares for  () bond. He purchased 1,125 shares of stock through bonds worth a total of  () and placed the remaining stock, 3,876 shares, in escrow, giving him 5,001 shares of the 10,000 shares. The plan was declared operative on July 2. Court proceedings dragged throughout the summer; Ochs accused Elys of intentionally delaying the court procedure and told his wife, Effie, \"He will certainly not be on my board of directors. He has cooked his goose with me. He has given me entirely too much anxiety to enlist my future friendship.\"\n\nOn August 13, 1896, Ochs officially purchased The New-York Times, and he was formally installed at 3:30 p.m. on August 18, the same day he moved into his office at 71 Park Row. The following day, the Times carried his declaration of principle, drafted with Effie. In the following months, he would come to know his staff. He displayed a particular admiration for Henry Loewenthal, a business-minded editor who eventually became managing editor until 1904. With Loewenthal, Ochs introduced a section entitled, \"Arrival of Buyers\" on September 20, 1896, that solidified The New-York Times as a merchant's newspaper. Loewenthal himself received a Monday financial review on November 8, 1897, eventually becoming a separate Times publication titled The Annalist. Ochs's focus on business news was met with ridicule from general news reporters, but ultimately brought new readers and advertising. In comparison to other publishers, he expanded the letter to the editor section and allowed critics of the Times to write to editors. Ochs respected Frederick Craig Mortimer, a columnist, and allowed him to start a section titled \"Topics of The Times\". Mortimer retired in 1926 and was replaced by Simeon Strunsky.\n\nBy 1869, readers sought to buy newspapers that were exclusively newspapers. Charles Anderson Dana's The Sun favored features over full coverage of the news. Newspapers that billed themselves as exclusively news—the New York Mercury, The New York Recorder, and the New-York Commercial Advertiser—were dying. The New York Tribune purchased the Recorder that year and inherited the paper's use of lithographs. In one Sunday issue, the Tribune gave away a lithograph of a basket of strawberries and a bottle of champagne. The move was so controversial that the Tribune ended the lithographs. Pulitzer's New York World berated the Times for \"[losing]  []\". Ochs continued to run the Times as usual as Dana mounted attacks against the paper and yellow journalism. He implemented a series of trivial changes, including removing Miller's fiction, altering the kerning and thinning the columns, bought better newsprint and ink, removed advertisements that generated the paper no revenue, and implemented datelines. He purchased nascent automatic space-equalizers to speed up production. The Sunday supplement, first issued on September 6, 1898, focused on current events, in comparison to the reused material other newspapers used at the time. In December, The New-York Times became The New York Times.\n\nIn October, the staff of The New-York Times tentatively chose the slogan, \"All the News That's Fit to Print\",  but created a contest to decide a better name, judged by The Century Magazine editor Richard Watson Gilder. Entries were limited: the motto or phrase could not exceed more than ten words—a clause many contestants ignored—and the Times ignored entries from women. The author of the winning submission would receive  (). A variety of slogans were entered in thousands of postcards, including rhymes—\"We use all news fit to peruse\"—and at least one acrostic—\"The Information Mankind Earnestly Seeks\"—with many containing a \"pure\" or \"clean\" undertone. The winner was D.M. Redfield of New Haven, Connecticut, who penned, \"All The World's News, but Not a School for Scandal\". Although Ochs enjoyed the slogan, he ultimately stuck with his original slogan, first printed on October 25, 1896. It became a part of the front page on February 10, 1897. The contest earned the paper further recognition nationally; the slogan has since become a leitmotif of American journalism. The slogan was also materialized in electric lights on the north side of the Cumberland Hotel on 22nd Street and was chanted by a group of Times staff marching in the Sound Money Parade.\n\nThe Spanish–American War in 1898 brought about a new set of challenges for Ochs. Hearst and Pulitzer were able to send dispatch boats and correspondents at a rate met only by Bennett. The New York Times prominently displayed the Associated Press's coverage to compensate and entered into a combination with the New York Evening Mail and the Commercial Advertiser; neither effort succeeded. In a final move, he lowered the price back to one cent () in October. The announcement was met by condemnation. The Journalist argued that readers would pay for any price and that the Times would not attract new readers. The Buffalo Express invoked Raymond and Jones's legacy in their critique. Yellow publications spread the rumor that The New York Times was being financed by Tammany Hall leader Richard Croker and that lowering the price would benefit the Democratic Party. Firmly, Ochs pushed forward. Within a month, production increased from five to eight times more in some districts. Within a year, circulation went from 25,726 to 76,220.\n\n1900–1908: Ochs era, international recognition, and Times Tower\nthumb|upright|Times Tower, the headquarters of The New York Times until 1913.\nIn January 1900, Adolph Ochs sent for his brother and Chattanooga Times general manager, George, to print a special edition of The New York Times at that year's Paris Exposition. At a cost of  (), George established six Linotype machines, an octuple Goss press, and a stereotyping plant. The plant was ready by March; it was visited by Leopold II of Belgium, who personally shook hands with Ochs. The special edition ran from June to October of that year. In Inter Ocean Publishing Co. v. Associated Press (1900), the Supreme Court of Illinois ruled that the Associated Press was a public utility, allowing The New York Times to receive full membership from its Class B status. In addition, Ochs became a chartered member and served on its board for twenty years. The reorganization committee was dissolved on July 1. In October, an alliance with The Times of London was discussed. Charles Frederic Moberly Bell, manager of The Times of London, proposed lending stories to the Times for a minimum of  () and forming the International Times. The resulting paper could have had an impact on Bennett's Paris Herald, but plans failed to materialize. At least one factor was that Ochs may have been labelled an Anglophile. The New York Times later purchased exclusive rights to The Times of Londons coverage and shared expenses during special events, such as the Russo-Japanese War.\n\nBy 1901, The New York Times was an independent Democratic newspaper, though it supported Republican William McKinley in the 1900 presidential election for his support of sound money, which Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan did not affirm. The Times continued to expand into the 20th century, particularly after the death of Queen Victoria and McKinley's assassination. Ochs planned a new building at 233 Broadway—the site of the present day Woolworth Building—in fall 1900 that would \"wake up the natives\". On July 1, 1902, the paper closed a deal to construct a new building at 42nd Street as the 233 Broadway plan fell through, much to Ochs's benefit; the construction of the first line of the New York City Subway contributed to northward growth, while Park Row was stagnant. The site at 42nd Street was a triangular plot between Broadway and Seventh Avenue, where the Pabst Hotel stood. In a front-page article, The New York Times claimed that the new building's proximity to a New York City Subway station would expand the paper's circulation. Architect Cyrus L. W. Eidlitz was hired to draft up plans for the building and site clearing began in December. Ochs's daughter, Iphigene Bertha Ochs, laid the cornerstone on January 18, 1904, murmuring, \"I declare this stone to be laid plumb, level and square.\" The building—still under construction—was used to announce that Theodore Roosevelt won the 1904 presidential election by searchlight; the Times supported Democrat Alton B. Parker that year.\n\nFollowing multiple delays and pluvial weather, the Times Tower opened on New Year's Eve to fireworks at a cost of  (). The following morning, men from the Mergenthaler Linotype Company and R. Hoe & Company brought the machinery from 41 Park Row to the Times Tower by horseback. New Hoe presses and Linotype machines were purchased. Much of the building was paid for with sums from The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, owned by James Hazen Hyde. Despite being financially invested by Equitable Life, The New York Times routinely covered the Armstrong Investigation, a New York State Legislature investigation into various life insurance companies initiated by alleged corporate malfeasance when Hyde hosted a Versailles-themed costume ball and was accused of spending  () through the company. Worried that Hearst may discover he was an Equitable debtor, Ochs told Marcellus Hartley Dodge Sr.—the grandson of arms dealer Marcellus Hartley who knew Ochs, that he wanted to take up the loan from Equitable and an additional  (), offering his majority share in the Times as collateral. Dodge secretly put the stock certificates in a safety deposit box until 1916, when The New York Times paid the loan.\n\nIn February 1904, Ochs hired Carr Van Anda, a reporter for The Sun, as managing editor. Van Anda extensively covered the Russo-Japanese War through The Times of London. The war dispatch detailing the Battle of Port Arthur for The New York Times was the first wireless report of a naval engagement. The telegraph was conducted by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co, who would continue to work with The New York Times thereafter, including transmitting the first account of an ocean disaster when the crew of the SS Cymric saved several dozen men aboard the St. Cuthbert, a freighter set ablaze in 1908 off Cape Sable Island. Under Van Anda, the Times entered an agreement to syndicate stories with the Chicago Tribune, including the account of the St. Cuthbert explosion. The New York Times was the first publication to report on explorer Robert Peary's expedition to the North Pole. Peary first contacted the New York Herald and requested two men who had gone over to the Times. The Heralds editor expressed little interest in covering Peary's expedition; the Times, by contrast, paid Peary  () for exclusive rights to his story. A year later, surgeon Frederick Cook claimed to have reached the North Pole before Peary and sold his story to the New York Herald. English journalist Philip Gibbs publicly downplayed Cook's claims in an interview with him in which Cook admitted that the only people who witnessed his feat were Eskimos. Several days later, Peary telegraphed that he had made it to the North Pole.\n\n1908–1918: Political realignment, the Titanic, and World War I\nthumb|left|upright|229 West 43rd Street, the headquarters of The New York Times until 2007.\nIn June 1908, Van Anda recruited Oscar King Davis to obtain William Howard Taft's platform amid breaks in the Republican Party's policy. Through senator William Borah, Davis obtained the platform and published it, much to the chagrin of the White House. The New York Times continued to oppose William Jennings Bryan's candidacy, supporting Taft in the 1908 presidential election. In the 1912 election, the Times supported Woodrow Wilson in an editorial. Wilson attributed his victory to the editorial; at the time, his gubernatorial record was marked by radicalism, much of which was subsided. The New York Times affirmed its support for Wilson amid fears that moderate factions of the Democratic Party would not support him. The Times did not entirely support Wilson's policies but disavowed the conservatism of Champ Clark. The paper continued to support Wilson through his presidency, including the passage of the Underwood-Simmons tariff. That year, Ochs began the tradition of lowering a lit ball on New Year's Day from the Times Tower. The Times Square Ball is dropped every year.\n\nthumb|upright|The New York Times on April 16, 1912, covering the sinking of the Titanic.\n\nIn the following years, The New York Times actively attempted to get exclusive coverage. In May 1910, Glenn Curtiss attempted to claim the  () prize set by the New York World by flying from Albany to New York City in a single day. Van Anda had boarded a New York Central Railroad train to follow his plane with Curtiss's wife, Lena, a maneuver deemed \"too dangerous\" for a lagged World reporter. In the early morning hours of April 15, 1912, the Associated Press released a bulletin stating that the RMS Titanic had reportedly signaled that it had hit an iceberg to a Marconi station. Thirty minutes later, the Titanic flashed an SOS signal and sunk. White Star Line executives reassured journalists that the Titanic was unsinkable. Against editors in New York and London, Van Anda sent his secretary and head of the archival library Tommy Bracken to unearth as much as possible about the Titanic. The issue of The New York Times that morning included a four-line header. The issue also included a two-column advertisement for a Titanic voyage later that week. By April 19, the Times had estimated 1,595 had died, though a Senate inquiry determined that 1,517 had died. The edition of The New York Times that day became a collector's item, and has been regarded as a great disaster report amid caution from other newspapers.\n\nBy 1911, The New York Times required more physical space; its staffing had increased and the growth of the metropolitan area necessitated more mechanical equipment, particularly for The Sunday Times. The mechanical basement was excavated a further , though the Times continued to face pressures to circulate more copies. In March 1911, the paper purchased the fee simple from 221 to 229 West 43rd Street, from theatre owner Lee Shubert. Connected to the Times Tower through pneumatic tubes, the buildings would serve as an annex for the mechanical and editorial departments. Mortimer J. Fox was contracted to erect a building at 229 West 43rd Street. Work began in March 1912 and completed in August 1913; during construction, the Times printed issues from the building. By the time of its completion, six hundred employees occupied 229 West 43rd Street, making The New York Times one of the largest employers in the area. The Times made the building its headquarters on February 2, 1913, but continued to use the Times Tower for publication and subscription offices until 1961. In April 1913, The New York Times added an eighth column.\n\nWorld War I presented journalistic difficulties that had not been experienced in The New York Timess coverage of the American Civil War. Adolph Ochs worked out a news exchange with The London Chronicle to enhance the Timess coverage of the war. Several correspondents were present in the German Empire as Times reporters; Frederic W. Wile was the first until his arrest, followed by Cyril Brown until the United States entered the war. Garet Garrett arrived in Berlin in 1915. The New York Times published the so-called British White Paper, hundreds of correspondence letters between the Foreign Office and the Central Powers leading up to the United Kingdom's declaration of war against Germany. A day later, the Times provided Kaiser Wilhelm II's perspective through Wile. The New York Timess two-sided approach continued into its coverage of the war itself, including the occupation of Lille, the Battle of Liège, and the siege of Namur. The Sunday issue contained war photographs in the rotogravure section with exceeding quality.\n\nAlthough The New York Times editorially believed that Austria and Germany were at fault for the war, the paper published documents from the war in full, without commentary. Supporters of German accused Ochs of giving in to The Times of London owner Lord Northcliffe's bias, while readers who sided with the Allies were not pleased with German arguments being presented alongside Allied arguments. Accusations that the Times gives in to British interests reoccurred in a Senatorial Committee in 1915; Montana senator Thomas J. Walsh insinuated editor-in-chief Charles Ransom Miller and Van Anda acted on behalf of the British in opposing Wilson's ship-purchase bill, questing deletions from a London dispatch stating that British steamship lines were outrageously charging American refugees that were not present in the New York World or the New York Tribune. In particular, Walsh stated that he \"was informed\" through a letter he received claiming from a member of the gentlemen's club the Junior Constitutional Club that a \"well-known Englishman\" was supporting Ochs with money to gain control of the paper. The letter appeared to be signed by an Arthur M. Abbey; the writer was never identified and never came forward.\n\nThe United States's entrance into World War I affected the paper's operations. Logistically, the war increased cable costs from  () to  (). War fever spread through The New York Times and several employees served in the war. Julius Ochs Adler, Ochs's nephew, went to serve overseas in the 77th Infantry Division. Five employees died, including Joyce Kilmer of the Sunday department, who became a sergeant in the 69th Infantry Regiment. Invigorated by a peace bid by Austria, Miller—whose previous work earned him much praise, wrote a controversial editorial advocating for Austria's position. The Times was accused of \"running up the white flag\" as scorn and denounicatory letters rolled in upon the paper. The Union League Club, composed of the most influential men in New York, scheduled a meeting to consider publicly denouncing The New York Times. Much to Ochs's surprise, several members refused to attend the meeting. New York Central Railroad president Chauncey Depew defended the paper in a letter to club secretary Henry C. Quimby, as did jurist Elihu Root and entrepreneur Frank Woolworth.\n\n1918–1928: Continued scientific coverage\nthumb|left|upright|Carr Van Anda promoted scientific coverage in The New York Times.\nIn the days following the end of World War I, The New York Times continued its coverage of the war. Van Anda sent correspondent Edwin Leland James to the Rhine and Walter Duranty to occupied Germany. James, Duranty, Charles H. Grasty, Charles Selden, and Ernst Marshall worked under Richard V. Oulahan on covering peace negotiations. James offered to provide the Times with a preliminary copy of the Treaty of Versailles, but the paper had already obtained the treaty through a Chicago Tribune reporter who gave the treaty to Borah. Van Anda opened a total of twenty-four telephone lines. The June 10, 1918 issue of The New York Times carried the treaty in full. The Times was able to obtain and publish several exclusive stories during the Paris Peace Conference despite the disapproval of some readers. Editorially, the Times supported the League of Nations wholeheartedly even as the United States refused to join. As the conference continued to play out, The New York Times returned to its coverage of technological advancements, such as the first transatlantic flight completed by a Curtiss NC-4. From 1896 to 1921, daily circulation increased from 9,000 to 323,000 and annual advertising lineage from 2,227,000 to 23,447,000 lines.\n\nThe New York Times focused on scientific news more than any other paper, an importance shared by E. W. Scripps of Scripps-Howard. Much of the Timess scientific coverage was done by John Swinton, an editorial writer. In 1860, Swinton wrote three and a half columns regarding the reprint of On the Origin of Species (1859) by Charles Darwin. An academic who studied astronomy and physics at Ohio University, Van Anda was eager to report on Albert Einstein in 1919. Einstein, a relatively unknown European theoretical physicist, formulated the equivalence principle and used the principle to test the gravitational pull of the Sun as an object passed close to its photosphere. The solar eclipse of May 29, 1919 provided the Royal Astronomical Society with a tangiable way to test Einstein's theory, attracting the attention of Van Anda. The Einstein contention of general relativity juxtaposed the Newtonian theory of gravitation and the Timess coverage of the findings of the eclipse provided Americans with an introduction to Einstein, though other newspapers remained uneasy of his theories.\n\nThe Times was involved in the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun through Van Anda's knowledge of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Van Anda sent Russell Owen to Princeton University for a photograph of a stele and discovered that eventual pharaoh Horemheb had attempted to erase Tutankhamun's signature in place of his own. The Horemheb forgery was a theory proposed by French Egyptologist Le Grain but never developed. Egyptologist Philip K. Hitti called the discovery a \"most remarkable example of scholarly intuition and acumen\". Several weeks later, Alva Johnston was sent to cover the American Association for the Advancement of Science's support of evolution, much to the ire of William Jennings Bryan, John Roach Straton, and other fundamentalists. The next day, the Times carried the first newspaper story about isotopes and alpha particles. Johnston's coverage earned him a Pulitzer Prize in 1922. The New York Times also carried crime stories, including extensive coverage of the shooting of architect Stanford White in 1906. Broad coverage occurred when the paper felt that injustice had occurred, such as the lynching of Leo Frank.\n\nOn July 18, 1922, Charles Miller died. His obituary covered the following day's editorial page, and Ochs, the Times editorial board, and Miller's associates followed his body to the Woodland Cemetery. Miller left his holdings in The New York Times to his two children; he was replaced by Rollo Ogden, a former New York Evening Post journalist. The Times experienced another loss with Van Anda's retirement in 1925. Prior to retiring, Van Anda had two major stories. In late July 1923, president Warren G. Harding fell ill. Van Anda sent Jim Hagerty to the president. Hagerty was staying at the Okema in Ludlow when he received news that Harding had died. By luck, Edward Klauber called the Okema attempting to reach Hagery but had reached a line in Rutland with Calvin Coolidge's stenographer, Edwin Geisser. Geisser gave Klauber as much detail as he requested, and the Times had exceptional coverage of Coolidge's inauguration. The day Van Anda retired, The New York Times had thorough coverage of the solar eclipse of January 24, 1925. Frederick T. Birchall was appointed managing editor in 1925, bringing a bout of liberalism with sports bylines.\n\nThroughout 1924, The New York Times continued to experience much of the success that it had earlier in the century. The paper's gross income exceeded  () that year while its Wide World photo service had one hundred employees by 1925. The Timess global coverage was supported by a superheterodyne receiver on top of 229 West 43rd Street to receive dispatches from the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, Italy, and Switzerland later expanding to Japan, China, and the Dutch West Indies. William Beebe gave readers stories from the tropical sea while Auguste Piccard reported from the stratosphere. By the end of the year, circulation was up to 351,000 and advertising lineage increased to 26,000,000. Despite Van Anda's departure, the Times continued to support scientific discoveries. In 1927, Ochs hired Waldemar Kaempffert, a science writer whom journalist Meyer Berger considered to be the first member of an editorial board exclusively devoted to science. Ochs would hire William L. Laurence three years later. Laurence and Kaempffery were frequently the first to report on new developments in science, such as sulfa drugs, penicillin, adrenocorticotropic hormones, and cortisone.\n\n1928–1939: Ochs's death, first Sulzberger era, and interwar period\n\nBy 1928, The New York Times had a gross income of  (). In August 1930, Herbert Pulitzer, grandson of Joseph Pulitzer, met with Ochs at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel to discuss selling the New York World, much to Ochs's surprise. Pulitzer suggested disposing of the Morning World and the Sunday issue to focus on the Evening World. Discussing the proposition with Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Julius Ochs Adler, Ochs returned to the Ritz-Carlton. He contended that Pulitzer should instead put out a newspaper similar to the Daily Mail—a \"condensed but not sensational\" newspaper—and did not believe it was appropriate for the \"ultraconservative\" Times to acquire the paper, believing William Randolph Hearst's New York American to be a more suitable consolidator. General manager Florence D. White stated that if Ochs rejected the offer, the paper would be sold to Ogden Mills Reid's nascent New York Herald Tribune, formed in 1924 by the merger of the New York Herald and Tribune, which would present Ochs with a serious threat. In February 1931, the Morning World and the Sunday World ceased to exist and the Evening World was consolidated into the Scripps-Howard Telegram, becoming the New York World-Telegram. In April 1932, James became managing editor when Birchall went to Berlin. His final stories covered his experience in the Soviet Union and Joseph Stalin's totalitarian and autocratic rule.\n\nOchs's authority decreased into the 1920s as his health began to deteriorate. On April 8, 1935, at approximately 1:45 p.m., Ochs suffered a cerebral hemorrhage following a long illness. An ambulance took him to Newell Sanitarium. Surrounded by his brother, his sister and her husband, his nephew, and his granddaughter, Ochs died at 3:55 p.m. As his body was laid to rest at the Temple Israel Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York City's flags were half-staffed. On May 7, the board elected Sulzberger as president and director. Adler became general manager. The following day, the Times editorial page carried Sulzberger's creed to continue Ochs's work. Under his will, Ochs's heirs inherited the Chattanooga Times. Sulzberger urged picture editor Charles M. Graves to hold off on any radical changes to the paper's layout for at least a year and attempted to reduce operating costs, including considering selling The Annalist, Current History, and Mid-Week Pictorial. Drawing contrast with his predecessor, Sulzberger supported wirephoto—a technology disdained by Ochs in the last years of his life after it was discovered the Associated Press did not consult him on using it. Sulzberger's interest in wirephotography gave rise to an increase in photography in the Times in general; the Times was able to wire a photograph of the wreckage of the USS Macon (ZRS-5) from San Francisco, startling users of the Associated Press's wirephoto service.\n\nSulzberger inherited a Times still reeling from the Great Depression; circulation numbers in 1935 were two-thirds of what they were in 1929. Over the next several years, he would cull many of the paper's publications, including Current History and Mid-Week Pictorial in 1936, though both publications faced an impending demise; the Sunday Times depreciated much of the value of Current History under Lester Markel, while Mid-Week Pictorial subdued as a result of the transition to wirephoto. The rotogravure section in the Sunday issue was also incorporated into The New York Times Magazine in 1942, an idea conceived by Markel decades prior but prevented by a newsprint shortage and Ochs's illness. The Annalist was sold to McGraw-Hill Publishing in October 1940 and World Wide Photos was sold to the Associated Press in 1941. Continuing to adhere to Ochsian principle, The News of the Week in Review was started in the Sunday issue. The weekly review was another Markel idea, but it faced opposition from Ochs, who assumed that readers read every issue for that week in full. The Review debuted on January 27, 1935, when Ochs's illness affected his ability to read every issue, bringing about substantial circulation.\n\nIn February 1937, The New York Times started a column titled, \"In Europe\"—later \"Affairs in Europe\" and eventually \"Abroad\"—written by correspondent Anne O'Hare McCormick. McCormick was previously noted for reporting on fascism in Europe, warning of Benito Mussolini's rise in 1921. As Sulzberger took the reins from Ochs, fascism continued to grip Europe; Mussolini prepared to go to war with Ethiopia, Adolf Hitler founded the Wehrmacht to fulfill the goal of retaking Nazi Germany's lost territory and to annex new territories. Domestically, the New Deal faced opposition while the Great Depression continued. The Spanish coup of July 1936 precipitated the Spanish Civil War. While in Seville, Frank Kluckhohn was the first to report on thirty-two German and Italian planes supporting the Nationalist faction. Germany and Italy did not want their intervention in the war to be publicized and the revelation nearly cost Kluckhohn his life, forcing him to flee Spain. By 1938, a tense air surrounded much of the world as the Anschluss and the occupation of Czechoslovakia solidified the beginning of a global war. During this time, The New York Times faced its own issues. On February 22, 1937, editorial head Rollo Ogden died. Sulzberger appointed John H. Finley to Ogden's post in April, though Finley would retire in November 1938 but retained his role in the Times as editor emeritus; Charles Merz became the head of the editorial page. Finley suffered a coronary embolism in his sleep in March 1940. On the morning of May 6, 1937, Ochs's widow, Effie Wise, died. Sulzberger continued to feign neutrality until June 1938.\n\nThe paper experienced an editorial shift as a byproduct of Charles Merz's shared ideology with Sulzberger. While the Times shifted its spacing to cover more of the war, the paper's editorials had a strong crusading spirit; though this belief was in opposition to what Ochs had established, Sulzberger and Merz felt as though the paper was firmly established as a newspaper for news and could properly split its editorials from its news. The New York Times was compelled to establish that the United States had an international role to play and that it needed to defend itself, government structure, and civil liberties to uphold democracy. The Times urged the United States to impose sanctions, as Europe had, on Italy following the country's war in Ethiopia. Through dwindling hope for the League of Nations in other newspapers, The New York Times wrote that the United States must shoulder its responsibilities \"as a world power\". The most extensive of these editorials came in February 1937, when the Times vehemently opposed Roosevelt's efforts to expand the Supreme Court. Fifty editorials were written before Roosevelt ultimately ended his plan six months later. Gay Talese described The New York Times of the 1930s as a Roman Catholic paper.\n\n1939–1945: World War II, the Manhattan Project, and international edition\nthumb|The New York Times newsroom, pictured in 1942.\nOn September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland. At the Reichstag building, Hitler gave a speech accusing Poland of attacking Germany heard by The New York Timess radio room. The Sunday issue of the Times on September 3 carried a seldom-used top line reading, \"Chamberlain Announces Britain Is At War With Germany\". The issue carried Neville Chamberlain's full shortwave address to the United Kingdom. As World War II continued, the Times used largescale headlines to update readers on the development of the war, including the occupation of Denmark, the invasion of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium. As Ochs had focused on delivering the news over advertisements during World War I, Sulzberger made room for developments in World War II. The Times reported on several exclusive stories, including the Yugoslav coup d'état. The war also resulted in several casualties. Byron Darnton, a war correspondent covering the Pacific War, was killed by an American B-25 Mitchell bomber in New Guinea; his work was valued by Douglas MacArthur. Other casualties include London correspondent Bob Post who died during the bombing of Wilhemshaven in February 1943.\n\nThe New York Times experimented with several ideas and forged its own political structure. The Times rejected the \"Independent Democrat\" label during the Ochs era and supported Republican Wendell Willkie in 1940, believing that an unprecedented third term for any president would not be beneficial for the country, though forwent the third term principle to support Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944 under the presumption that he would win the war over a nascent candidate. As The New York Times Magazine flourished and the Times grew to the largest staff in the world, Sulzberger ran a women's column, \"News of Food\", that received criticism. Sulzberger established the \"Fashion of The Times\"—a fashion show held in the Times Hall—amid hesitation from editorial staff; Ochs had run fashion contests as far back as 1913. The fashion show was much the work of Virginia Pope, a fashion editor who ran several smaller fashion shows in women's clubs but desired a larger audience. The Fashion of the Times earned the paper substantial gains. In 1944, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the Timess acquisition of WQXR-FM, marking the first non-Times investment since the Jones era.\n\nAmid World War II, Sulzberger and his assistant, James Reston, traveled from Habbaniyah, Iraq to Tehran to meet Donald H. Connolly at the Persian Gulf Service Command Headquarters. Connolly's men supplied Allied troops; while beneficial, they felt that their work was disconnected from combat, monotonous, and tedious in extreme hot temperatures. Sulzberger proposed keeping the troops informed to improve their morale. The Times would provide the armed forces with an eight-page paper subtitled Overseas Weekly, a smaller version of The News of the Week in Review. Army Special Services was initially eager to work with The New York Times but backed out upon realizing that other newspapers would be infuriated if they discovered that the Times was the sole provider of news to the troops. An aide to Connolly suggested that the Times could be sold as a commodity through the Army & Air Force Exchange Service. The New York Times cast matrices in plastic and flew them to Iran. Bookkeepers could not accept free commodities, so the issues were sold at  (). The Overseas Weekly issue was a success and would later be available in Japan through The Asahi Shimbun and in Germany through the Frankfurter Zeitung.\n\nBy the end of World War II in 1945, over nine hundred employees of the Times had left to serve in the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. Delegates at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in April 1945 were surprised to have received a four-page copy of The New York Times dated at 2 a.m. The special edition facsimile was the first of its kind; it was set in type in New York and sent to an Associated Press receiver at the San Francisco Chronicle Building at 901 Mission Street. The paper negatives were processed at the Richmond Independent processing plant. Through the conference, the Times provided the United Nations delegates with this service for free. The New York Times would attempt facsimile in February 1948 to fourteen department stores in New York and the Columbia University School of Journalism. For Roosevelt's death, Sulzberger turned to the blackened borders that were present for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, but limited its scope to the Roosevelt editorial. To triumphantly declare the signage of the German Instrument of Surrender and the end of World War II in Europe, the Times used a rare four-line display foremost proclaiming, \"The war in Europe is ended!\"\n\nThe staff of The New York Times questioned the sudden disappearance of science reporter William L. Laurence in April 1945, though managing editor Edwin Leland James and Sulzberger were vaguely aware of his assignment. Leading up to World War II, Laurence was versed in the activities of the Columbia University Physics Department, including the discovery of Uranium-235. Writing for The Saturday Evening Post in September 1940, Laurence publicized the atomic bomb race between the United States and Germany. Copies of the paper in public libraries were seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and soon thereafter scientists sought to avoid Laurence. He theorized that they were working on an atomic bomb and did not attempt to investigate the matter further. The United States government requested Laurence's services in April 1945 and he was made the historian of the Manhattan Project. Laurence regularly spoke to the project's director, Leslie Groves, and provided eyewitness accounts of the tests, including Trinity. Believing the tests to be major stories themselves, Laurence wrote a confidential letter to Sulzberger. The staff of the Times learned through the atomic bombing of Hiroshima that Laurence was the sole witness of the Manhattan Project.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nCitations\n\nWorks cited\nThe New York Times\n\nBooks\n\n \n\nReports\n\nArticles\n\nCategory:The New York Times",

While living in Turin in 1908, he attended the classical high school Massimo d'Azeglio, where he was a student of Umberto Cosmo, and obtained his high school diploma. At the University he graduated first in literature and then, in 1931, thinking of pursuing a diplomatic career, also in law. During his studies he met many exponents of the Turin intellectuals of the time, such as Augusto Monti, Lalla Romano, Leone Ginzburg, Cesare Pavese, Norberto Bobbio, Massimo Mila and Ludovico Geymonat.\n\nOn 31 May 1929 he was arrested for having signed, with other Turin intellectuals, a letter of solidarity with Benedetto Croce. After a month in prison, he was sentenced to three years of confinement but the sentence was commuted to a warning. He then worked as a substitute teacher in the Liceo d'Azeglio and was also Gianni Agnelli's private tutor. From 1932 he was director of the Biblioteca Europea dei libri series of the Frassinelli publisher. By his choice, works by Herman Melville and Franz Kafka, Eugene Gladstone O'Neill and James Joyce, as well as Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, entered Italy for the first time.\n\nHis  association the Turin group of Justice and Freedom gathered in the editorial staff of the magazine Cultura published by Einaudi and which included, among others, Carlo Levi and Cesare Pavese, caused his arrest in May 1935 which occurred following the denunciation by the writer Pitigrilli. On 15 July Antonicelli was sentenced to three years of confinement to be served in Agropoli. During his confinement he married Renata Germano, daughter of the notary Annibale, in whose villa in Sordevolo he often stayed and met his friends. He was freed in March 1936.\n\nIn 1942 he founded the Francesco De Silva publishing house and committed himself, urged by Croce, to the reorganization of the Liberal Party. Immediately after 8 September he moved to Rome where on 6 November he was arrested by the Germans and imprisoned in Regina Coeli. In February 1944 he was transferred to the Castelfranco Emilia prison and was released on 18 April. Returning to Turin, he joined, as a representative of the Liberal Party, the National Liberation Committee of Piedmont, of which he assumed the presidency in 1945 , he directed the edition of the clandestine Risorgimento Liberale - which took the name of the Liberation Opinion - and collaborated on the Risorgimento and Il Patriota newspapers, a publication of the liberal partisan groups operating in Piedmont.\n\nAfter the fall of fascism, in June 1945, he participated in the foundation of the \"Cultural Union\" of Turin, which after his death was named after him. His political idea, in favor of maintaining an agreement with all the anti-fascist forces in the spirit of the CLN, and his republican choice came into conflict with the line of the party,  which supported the monarchy and determined to break the anti-fascist unity. Thus, in April 1946, he left the Liberal Party for the Democratic-Republican Concentration of Ugo La Malfa and Ferruccio Parri, which merged after the referendum of 2 June 1946 into the Republican Party, of which he became one of the leaders at the Naples congress of 1948. The party's choice to ally with the Christian Democrats in the elections of 18 April convinced him to abandon the party.\n\nHe was a founder of the Historical Institute of the Resistance in Piedmont on 25 April 1947 and became its first president. In that year he published If This is a Man, Primo Levi's masterpiece which had been rejected by other publishers, including Einaudi. It was one of the last publications of the Da Silva publishing house, which Antonicelli closed in 1949.\n\nIn this period he collaborated with RAI with the cultural radio program Terza pagina, and with the Turin newspaper La Stampa, with articles on French literature and Italian decadentism.\n\nIn 1953 he joined the National Democratic Alliance, a grouping of liberals and republicans opposed to the political alliance with the Christian Democrats, which fought against the so-called \"scam law\", the electoral law which provided a prize to the list that obtained the majority absolute in the elections, and which was repealed following the defeat of the centrist parties in favor of the law in the June 7 elections. He took a stand against the political and trade union discrimination carried out by Vittorio Valletta's FIAT against communist workers or members of the FIOM and in 1960 he argued that the Tambroni government , elected with the votes of the DC and the MSI , represented a danger for Italian democracy, so more after the demonstrations in multiple cities in which there were also deaths among the demonstrators. Having denounced these facts in a speech in Bologna , Antonicelli was tried for condoning a crime. He was sentenced in the first instance with probation, he was acquitted on appeal.\n\nIn 1968 he was elected to the Senate as an independent on the PCI - PSIUP list for the Alessandria-Tortona constituency. On that occasion, the group of left-wing independents was formed for the first time in Parliament and Antonicelli was a member of the Defense, Public Education and Supervision commissions for radio and television broadcasts. He was re-elected in the 1972 political elections, and took part in the Defense and Radio and Television Supervision commissions.",

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Geese_Descending_on_the_Sandbank",
        "content": "Wild geese descending on the sandbank is an ancient Chinese Guqin melody, one of the most notable Guqin pieces together with \"Guangling San\", \"Yangguan San Die\", \"Meihua San Nong\", and others.\n\nIts notation first appeared in a Ming dynasty tablature Ancient Tones Authenticated (古音正宗）compiled by Zhu Changfang. The tranquil and serene piece depicts the scene of wild geese flying and alighting by the water. The Qing dynasty Guqin Notation of Heavenly Sound Pavilion had an introduction: \"Set against the clear autumn sky, the air is crisp and fresh, while the breeze remains calm, as does the sandbank by the water. Amidst clouds stretching for miles, wild geese fly and chant, embodying lofty aspirations akin to those of hermits.\"\n\nThe musical composition commences with a soothing rhythm and delicate harmonics, illustrating the serene expanse of twilight on the autumn river. Subsequently, the melody undergoes a transition into a lively and agile tune, adorned with patterns reminiscent of geese calls, conveying vitality and jubilance. Eventually, it reverts to a harmonious and tranquil melody. The ambiance evokes serenity and ethereality, while simultaneously retaining lively intrigue. The distinctive techniques employed in Guqin performance, including harmonics and glissando, enhance the musical piece, endowing it with a profound artistic allure.\n\n Versions \nThe earliest surviving notation was first printed in the late Ming dynasty tablature Ancient Tones Authenticated by Zhu Changfang. Zhang Dai's Dream Memories of Tao'an stated that Yin Zhixian, the author of \"Huí Yán Mìzhǐ,\" learned this piece from Wang Benwu in Shaoxing towards the end of the Wanli era. Subsequently, around fifty Guqin notation collections included different schools and versions of the piece. The authorship of these pieces also varied among collections, including poet Chen Zi'ang from the Tang dynasty, Mao Zhongmin and Tian Zhiweng from the Song dynasty, and Zhu Quan from the Ming dynasty.\n\n Modern adaptions and recordings \n \"Jiao'an Guqin score\" version, consisting of seven sections, represents the Guangling school, with recordings by Liu Shaochun, Zhang Ziqian, and others。\n \"Qinxue Series\" version, also with seven sections, commonly known as \"North Sandbank,\" represented by Guan Pinghu's recordings.\n The Pei Jieqing transmitted score, also known as \"Chuan School Sandbank\" or \"South Sandbank,\" can be found in the \"Yinyinshi Qin Score\" written by Hong Kong qin player Cai Deyun. \n \"Mei'an Guqin Score\" version, representing the Meian school, adds a section describing the calls of geese and the circling of the flock, vividly and distinctly, under the composition of Wang Yanqing.\n The Wu Jixi transmitted score, representing the Min school, is the version played by Chen Changlin.\n Versions by Wu Lansun and Wu Zhaoji, included in the \"Wu School Qin Score.\" \n\n Reference \n\n External Links \n\n ，《蕉庵琴譜》本，劉少椿演奏\n ，《蕉庵琴譜》本，林友仁演奏\n ，《梅庵琴譜》本，楊秋悅演奏\n ，裴介卿傳譜本，沈草農演奏\n ，《琴學叢書》本，孫貴生演奏\n ，《指法匯參確解》，林晨演奏\n ，《琴學叢書》本，楊葆元演奏\nCategory:Songs about birds",

It was based on the Australian verse drama The Fire on the Snow by Douglas Stewart about the Terra Nova Expedition to Antarctica by Robert Falcon Scott. The prouction was the first time an Australian radio drama had received such a prestigious production at the BBC. It was directed by Tyrone Guthrie and featured two movie stars, John Mills and Peter Finch. \n\nStewart's play originally aired in Australia in 1941. Peter Finch was meant to appear in the original production but enlisted in the army. The play was much acclaimed in Australia and was performed several times.\n\nTyrone Guthrie rarely produced for the BBC but was an admirer of the play and agreed to direct it. Guthrie said:\nIn my opinion this is one of the few important works of art which radio has so far produced. It is the  more thrilling that it has come from Australia, a continent which has not —as yet— made very many or very  notable contributions to the art and literature bf the human race. As yet, Australia is only beginning  to grope towards a distinctively Australian way of seeing and hearing and then expressing things...Australia is just beginning to realise that dependence upon the culture of other communities is not healthy or satisfying.\n\nReception\nThe Observer called the play \"exceedingly interesting.\" The Guardian called it \"a moving and dramatic composition\".\n\nThe play received some criticism in Britain because of its historical depiction of Scott.\n\nCast\nJohn Mills as Captain Robert Falcon Scott, C.V.O., R.N.\nPeter Finch as Edward Adrian Wilson, B.A., M.B.\nPeter Coke as Captain Lawrence E.G.

        "content": " The Capture of La Mámora was a successful Spanish raid, commanded by Admiral Luis Fajardo y Chacón, on the town of La Mamora, south of El Araich in August 1614 as part of a campaign against privateering at the Moroccan coast. The fortress remained part of the Spanish Kingdom until 1681 when Muley Ismail Ibn Sharif, the Sultan of Morocco took the city from the Spaniards.\n Background \nBy the year 1604, after the first Anglo-Spanish War, pirates had established a pirate haven at La Mamora, it became the main retreat of Atlantic pirates under the command of Henry Mainwaring.  Philip III of Spain had started a campaign against privateering that led to the Cession of Larache in 1610.\n\nBy the summer of 1614, both the Dutch and the Spanish, had ambitions to seize the town. The Dutch Admiral, Jan Evertsen had arrived in Morocco in June 1614 with a fleet of Dutch warships with the brief of entering La Mamora, defeating the pirates and building a fort which would be a Dutch stronghold. While negotiations were taking place between the Dutch and Muley Zaydan, the Spaniards raided the town in August, taking it with hardly any conflict.\n\n Operation \nIn August 1614, an expeditionary force  of 20 warships was sent across the Straits under the command of Luis Fajardo. With most of the corsairs absent, few men remained to defend the city, they sank two ships at the mouth of the harbor to prevent the Spanish invaders from swooping in. Once Spanish guns decimated the spars and yards that blocked the entrance, the corsairs realized the hopelessness of their situation and torched their ships before fleeing. Once they were gone, Spain seized control of the pirate haven.Vallar, Cindy. \"Sir Henry Mainwaring, Pirate, Pirate Hunter, and Royalist.\" Pirates and Privateers: the History of Maritime Piracy. 2009.\n\nRenamed San Miguel de Ultramar , it would remain under Spanish rule for 67 years, until 1681, when the Alawite Sultan Ismaíl of Morocco recaptures it.\n\n References \n\n Literature \n Fernández Duro, Cesáreo (1895).

        "title": "Theodosius Nagashima",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_Nagashima",
        "content": "Metropolitan Theodosius (, ; secular name Basil Nagashima Shinji, ; April 3, 1935 – May 7, 1999) was primate of the Japanese Orthodox Church, the Autonomous Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, with the title: Archbishop of Tokyo, Metropolitan of All Japan.\n\n Biography \nHe was born on April 3, 1935 in the Ōmiya (now in the city of Saitama), Saitama Prefecture, Japan, in a Buddhist family.\n\nWhile studying in elementary school, he attended the Holy Resurrection Cathedral (nikorai-dō) in Tokyo to listen to Eastern Orthodox hymns. Nagashima Shinji began to attend an educational missionary circle, and in 1952 he was baptized with the name Basil. Nagashima's father and two brothers also converted to Orthodoxy.\n\nAfter completing his secondary education, he was preparing to enter university, but conversion to Orthodoxy changed his views, and in 1954 he entered the newly revived Tokyo Theological Seminary. On February 5, 1958, together with other seminarians, he founded the religious magazine \"The Way\" (\"michi\"). Although the magazine ceased publication after four issues, it served as the beginning of Nagashima's writing and publishing works.\n\nAfter graduating from the seminary in 1958, Basil Nagashima was sent as a catechist to the church in the name of the Great Martyr Demetrius of Thessalonica in the city of Yamato. At the same time, he assumed the duties of editor of the official Japanese church newspaper Orthodox Bulletin (seikyō jihō). After that, he served as a catechist in the Kanda district church (Tokyo) for two years, and in July 1962 he was transferred to the Apostle James Church in Kagoshima City. Here he continued his catechetical ministry, often visiting the remote borders of Kyushu Island with missionary visits.\n\nIn 1964 Bishop Vladimir (Nagosky) ordained catechist Basil a deacon and soon a presbyter. While in Kyushu, Fr. Basil began to express a desire to become a monk, and in July 1965 Bishop Vladimir sent him to the United States for obedience to St. Tikhon's Monastery in South Canaan, Pennsylvania, where Saint Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary also located. From America, the priest Basil wrote to Bishop Vladimir that he had strengthened his desire to become a monk; nevertheless, in July 1967, he was recalled to Japan and returned to serve at the church in Kagoshima City.\n\nBy 1969, when the Orthodox Church in Japan was on the verge of gaining autonomy, it became necessary to elect bishops from the Japanese. On October 19, at an extraordinary meeting on this issue, two candidates were elected – Hierodeacon Seraphim (Sigrist) and priest Basil Nagashima, who, obeying the will of the Church, took vows with the name Theodosius in honor of St. Theodosius of Chernigov. On November 2, 1969, in accordance with the decision of the Bishops' Council of the Northern American Metropolis, Archimandrite Theodosius was consecrated Bishop of Kyoto. The consecration was performed by Archbishop John (Shakhovskoy) of San Francisco and Bishop Vladimir (Nagossky) of Tokyo.\n\nThe structure and administrative institutions of the autonomous Church were determined at two Councils in 1970 – the annual July Council and the Extraordinary Council on November 15–16. In accordance with the Patriarchal Tomos, three dioceses were established in the Japanese Church:  Archdiocese of Tokyo, headed by the primate; the Diocese of Western Japan centered in Kyoto, headed by Bishop Theodosius, and the Diocese of Eastern Japan centered in Sendai\n\nOn February 10, 1972, Metropolitan Vladimir (Nagosky) sent a notice to the Japanese clergy about his resignation from the post of primate of the Japanese Orthodox Church, at the same time sending a petition for admission to the number of bishops of the Orthodox Church of America. He appointed Bishop Theodosius (Nagashima) of Kyoto as the locum tenens of the Church. The issue of electing a new primate turned out to be difficult: the most relevant candidate, Bishop Theodosius, has not yet gained proper authority among the clergy and believers, and therefore the Japanese leadership of the Church, headed by Fr. Basil Takeoka began to openly speak out against the election of a new primate, offering to grant all powers to the Metropolitan Council..\n\nThe issue of replacing the see of Tokyo was resolved at an extraordinary Council on March 19, 1972. In addition to the three bishops of the Japanese Church, Archbishop Juvenal (Poyarkov), Deputy Chairman of the DECR, attended it, whose main task was to convince the Japanese clergy that the existence of the Church without a ruling bishop did not comply with canonical rules and, therefore, would not be approved by the Moscow Patriarchate. Metropolitan Vladimir also stressed the need to elect a successor, expressing the opinion that for the further development of the Church, turning it into a \"truly Japanese\" one, it is necessary to have a Japanese primate, he recommended Bishop Theodosius to the Council. Archbishop Juvenal, for his part, also assured the participants that the Moscow had no objections to a Japanese occupying the metropolitan see, although, of course, if they wished to receive an bishop from the Russian Orthodox Church, the Patriarch would not ignore this request either. Convinced that the nomination of a new primate was an urgent need, the delegates of the Council chose the Japanese: the decision in favor of Bishop Theodosius (Nagashima) of Kyoto and Western Japan was made unanimously. On March 21, 1972, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church granted Metropolitan Vladimir's request for resignation and approved the candidacy of a new primate. On March 27, 1972, Archbishop Juvenal and a delegation of the autonomous Church headed by Bishop Theodosius flew to the USSR. On March 28 of the same year, Patriarch Pimen of Moscow headed the enthronement of the new primate.\n\nAt first,Metropolitan Theodosius had to make considerable efforts to overcome the skeptical attitude of part of the Orthodox flock towards him and the inertia of the elders of the diocesan administration; at the same time, three months later, Nikorai-dō parishioners noted that the new bishop \"in relation to believers ... holds himself much higher and more unapproachable compared to Metropolitan Vladimir\". Metropolitan Theodosius was supported mainly by people of his generation, graduates of St. Vladimir's Seminary: he promoted 39-year-old priest Sabbas Onami, who served in Yamate Parish and served as metropolitan translator and secretary, to the position of head of the Tokyo Consistory; In the Diocese of Kyoto, an important role was played by 41-year—old Archpriest Cyril Arihara, rector of the Osaka Church, and the rector of the Kobe parish, 36-year-old priest Proclus Ushimaru, a classmate of Metropolitan Theodosius at the Tokyo Seminary, a church historian and the only employee of the Department of External Relations of the Japanese Orthodox Church. In Sendai, the burden of diocesan affairs rested on 39-year-old priest Justin Yamaguchi. Already at the Council in July 1972, a number of relocations were made in the Church on the initiative of the new primate: according to the servants of the Patriarchal Compound in Tokyo, \"all those who were in good relations with the former Metropolitan Vladimir turned out to be far on the periphery\".\n\nUnder Metropolitan Theodosius, the problem of the development of monastic life remained unresolved: apart from the St. Sophia Monastery in Chiba, which was a private initiative of Bishop Nicholas (Sayama), not a single monastery was founded in Japan. The absence of the institution of monasticism, in turn, made it difficult for the succession of episcopal authority in the three departments of the autonomous Church.\n\nHe died on May 7, 1999. On May 13 of the same year, at 13:00, his funeral service was held at the Holy Resurrection Cathedral in Tokyo, which was performed by: Archbishop Clement (Kapalin) of Kaluga and Borovsk, Archbishop Herman (Swaiko) of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania (Orthodox Church in America), rector of St. Sophia Monastery in Chiba Archbishop Nicholas (Sayama) of Ramenskoye, Bishop Sotirios (Trambas) of Seoul and Korea (Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople), Archpriest John Udics (Orthodox Church in America), Archpriest Nikolai Katsyuban and twenty-four priests of the Japanese Orthodox Church. The funeral service was performed according to the priestly rite in the Church Slavonic and Classical Japanese languages. Under the funeral bells and the singing of the Irmos of the Great Canon \"Helper and Patron\", the coffin with the body of the deceased archpastor was surrounded by the clergy around the cathedral. The archpastors and priests performed the last requiem mass in front of the cathedral. Metropolitan Theodosius was buried at the Yanaka Cemetery, where the tomb of Equal-to-the-Apostles Nicholas of Japan is located, and where Metropolitan Sergius (Tikhomirov) and Bishop Nicholas (Ono) was also buried.\n\n Reflist \n\n Literature \n \n \n \n\nCategory:1935 births\nCategory:1999 deaths\nCategory:Orthodox Church in Japan\nCategory:Eastern Orthodox Christians from Japan\nCategory:Eastern Orthodox primates\nCategory:People from Saitama Prefecture",

        "content": " \nOur Saviour Lutheran Church in Baltimore, Maryland, is affiliated with the Southeastern District of the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod. The building is noted as one of the first in America to combine the architecture of the Early English and Norman periods (X 76) and is prominently located at 3301 The Alameda.\nHistory\nThe congregation of Our Saviour Lutheran Church purchased its present site at 33rd Street and The Alameda from the Frank Novak Realty Company in 1919, and in 1920 constructed a wood frame chapel that seated 200. On August 8, 1921, a fire burned the rear half of the chapel, destroying the pipe organ that the congregation had brought with them from their former home on E. Fairmount Avenue in Baltimore. (LAND 7,9)\nPlans to have  architect J.A. Dempwork design a church were abandoned with the arrival of Pastor Rev. Adolph John  Stiemke in 1924: he guided the congregation toward building a stone church, and hired the architecture firm of Frohman, Robb, and Little—the same firm that designed Washington National Cathedral.  Initial sketches and preliminary plans were provided in June 1927, and Edward A. Wehr of Pittsburgh was chosen as the general contractor.  Stiemke would remain as pastor until 1961.  (LAND 11,12,14)\nGround was broken on November 25, 1928, and the cornerstone for the present building was laid on August 4, 1929. Dedicated on September 7, 1930, Our Saviour Lutheran Church is still known as one of “the finest small churches in America.” (X 15,18) \nTwo decades after opening its new church, the congregation had grown in number and expanded its activities. It had a robust Sunday School, and in 1951 the church opened the first Sunday School class for children and young adults with intellectual disabilities. This growth required the addition of a Parish Activities Building, to contain classrooms and meeting spaces, which was designed by architect Howard G. Hall of Baltimore. The contractor was J.H. Williams, and the building cost $178,360.28. It was dedicated in June 1958. (Land 27 )\nProperty\nThe church is located at the northeast corner of 33rd Street and The Alameda in the Ednor Gardens-Lakeside neighborhood, about 4 miles NNW from the center of Baltimore. It stands diagonally across 33rd Street from Baltimore City College, which is of similar style and stone color. \n\nArchitectural features\nOur Saviour Lutheran Church combines the architecture of the Early English and the Norman periods. It was built with the thought of permanency, and incorporated a true devotional atmosphere.\nThe interior includes a chancel 20' wide by 33' 7\" deep, a nave 22' wide by 80' long, and side aisles 11' in width. It seats 210 in the nave proper, the side aisles seat 136 more, and there are 36 main-floor sittings on the first level of the tower. There is no west gallery. Each bay is 14' on centers and each arch is 22' 6\" high to its peak. The columns are 14' high and 24\" thick, with good capitals and bases.  (WEBB-a)\nThe wrought iron hardware, made by Philadelphia craftsman Samuel Yellin, is of special interest because of its excellent conformity with the architectural motif. (X 76)\n\nStained glass\nthumb\nIn the years between 1949 and 1962, members of the congregation commissioned 32 stained glass windows from the Willet Stained Glass Company of Philadelphia. \nThe first three windows to be installed were those above the altar: they depict the article of faith, that both the Old and New Testaments reveal Jesus Christ as the  Saviour. In 1949 they were dedicated as a memorial to four members of the congregation who died in World War II: the windows were donated by the parents of the veterans and other members of the congregation (X 82).   All of the windows were designed by Marguerite Gaudin (an internationally famous stained-glass designer at  Willet  Studios).  Among Gaudin’s other notable design achievements were windows for the National Presbyterian Church and Chapel in Washington, D.C., the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, and Grace Episcopal Cathedral in San Francisco.\nMost of the church’s windows depict two or three related scenes from the Old or New Testaments; others contain illustrations of the various Creeds of the Church or its hymns, e.g., \"Te Deum.\" (YOUTUBE 1)\n\nChancel\nthumb\nThe furnishings in the chancel are particularly harmonious, because the pipe organ, altar, pulpit, communion rail, hymn boards, and lectern were all designed and built by M.P. Moller Organ Company of Hagerstown, MD. (M1930)\nThe altar features a wooden carved reredos, which includes images of the four evangelists (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). The reredos also holds a cross and candlesticks. \n\nTower\nTypical of Norman towers,  the tower at Our Saviour is substantial (WIKI 1): it is about 72’ high  and 25’ square, with one large, unvaulted arch on the west face. The tower has a short ground stage, a long second stage, a short stage at the ringer's room, and a longer belfry stage.  (WEBB-b).  The stone walls are 3' 6\" thick at the lower stage, 4' 9\" thick where tower and nave join, and drop back to 2' 4\" at the belfry stage. (WEBB-c)\nThe inside of the tower is open from the floor to the ringing chamber (a distance of 40'), and an arch close to 30' high opens out of the tower into the nave. There is no western gallery.  (WEBB-d)\nOne authority has said that “this is but one of perhaps a scant two dozen churches in the United States where the tower happens to be of dignified mass.” (WEBB-c)     \nThe tower doorway is done in a style that is transitional from Norman to Early English (WEBB-e).  \n\nBells\nFile:18_Bells_at_Our_Saviour.png\n\nThe 18 bells in the tower were a gift from two members of the congregation, John and Alma Wever, in 1934. (x 77) They were cast by the McShane Bell Foundry Company of Baltimore. At that time, they were the largest set of carillon bells in Maryland and the largest set cast in an American foundry. (X 78) They  each weigh between 500 and 3,000 pounds, and each has a lengthy inscription consisting of Bible verses and dedications. (LAND 81)\nNow playable from the organ console, the range and equal temperament of the bells are such that all melodies can be played or transposed to come within the compass of the chime.\nIn earlier days, the bells were frequently used to greet marchers as they paraded westbound along 33rd Street toward Memorial Stadium for various sporting events.\n\nMoeller Pipe Organ\nthumb\nIn 1930 the church contracted with M.P. Moeller Organ Company of Hagerstown, MD, to build a two-manual pipe organ of 13 ranks (825 pipes), using pitman chests.  Their Opus 5779 was delivered later that year, at a cost of $5,000. (M1930)\nMoeller rebuilt the organ in 1987, adding 5 ranks (317 pipes) and updating the wiring and voicing of the instrument. (M1987).  Viscount Organs replaced the original console in 2023, and added 13 new computer-generated voices. The new console features 99 levels of memory, and interfaces with all 18 ranks of pipes, the 18 tower bells, and a bell toller. (V1 )\n\nHistory of the Congregation\nThe rich history of Our Saviour Lutheran Church’s congregation dates back to March 7, 1892, when 12 active members of the then-German Immanuel Lutheran Church were granted a peaceful release to become the nucleus of a new English- speaking congregation that became known as the Jackson Square Lutheran Church. (LAND 1)  When the congregation moved to its current site on The Alameda, it changed its name to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Our Saviour. (LAND 7)\nIn 1973, this congregation merged with another historic Lutheran congregation: St. Matthew Lutheran Church, which was located at 1901 Druid Hill Ave. St. Matthew’s had been founded in 1929 by a group of African American Lutherans who moved from rural Meherrin, Virginia, to Baltimore in the first wave of the Great Migration. (LAND 55) The new combined congregation—composed of a predominately Black parish of 110 communicants and a predominantly White parish of 325 communicants—was renamed “Lutheran Church of Our Saviour.” Mergers between predominantly white and a predominantly African American congregations were highly uncommon, and this melding set a precedent in both Baltimore and the Lutheran Church’s Missouri Synod. (LAND 56)\nThe congregation has a long history of being active in its community: in addition to starting the city's first Sunday School for children and young adults with disabilities in 1951, it helped develop a community health facility and child care center. (Land 40)\nToday, the congregation is still thriving and serving its community at large.\nCivil Rights Activism of the Congregationn\n\nOur Saviour Lutheran Church was one of eight in its neighborhood and the adjoining neighborhood of Coldsteam-Homestead- Montebello that banded together to fight “blockbusting” in their communities in the 1960s and 1970s—that is, when agents were “buying properties from white people for cheap due to fears of an influx of African-Americans, and then selling to African-Americans for significantly higher prices and often with financially-predatory lending terms.” (Land 41).  The eight churches formed Homestead-Montebello Churches, Inc., which worked with community partners and was “resolute in their determination to expose instances of unlawful real property schemes, and to assist those residents so victimized by seeking redress of their losses to the fullest extent of all available remedies at law.” (LAND 31)\n\nThis group of churches pooled their resources to hire Vincent Quayle, then a Jesuit seminarian, to investigate the predatory real estate practices in the area. (LAND 32) Quayle later went on to found and become the long-running Executive Director of St. Ambrose Housing Aid Center. Thanks to the efforts of fair-housing advocates, Homestead-Montebello Churches Inc., and others, the U.S. Department of Justice initiated an investigation into the blockbusting practices in Baltimore. They were made illegal under the 1968 Civil Rights Act. \n\nIn October 1972, the congregation hosted a meeting for city housing officials (including Housing Commissioner Robert Embry, Jr.) and neighborhood groups on the topic of racial “steering” practices.

He was known for his corruption and tight grip on Malian security during his tenure, and was ousted by Moussa Traoré in 1978.\n\n Biography \nDoukara was born to a Soninke family in 1934 in the village of Wolocoro, near Mourdiah, French Sudan. Doukara participated in the 1968 Malian coup d'état against Modibo Keïta, and was a founding member of the Military Committee for National Liberation. In 1970, he became Mali's Minister of Defense and Internal Security. Doukara helped arrest dissidents to the Military Committee, such as arresting Yoro Diakité and Malik Diallo in 1970.\n\nDoukara was put in charge of alleviating a famine caused by a drought in 1974. Like many other Malian officials, he embezzled huge sums of money from foreign aid funds. Around this same time, a border dispute with Upper Volta led to the strengthening of the Malian army and Doukara's political position. Doukara and Tiécoro Bagayoko were the most influential members of the Military Committee, and notorious for their abuses. Both Doukara and Bagayoko opposed Traore's plan for civilian rule, which included the establishment of the Democratic Union of the Malian People in 1976. Traore attempted to oust Doukara, citing corruption, in 1978. Other corrupt members of the committee opposed Traore, and Doukara and Bagayoko were instead charged with planning a coup and assassination of Traore.\n\nDoukara, Bagayoko, and Public Works Minister Karim Dembele were arrested by Traore in February 1978. Foreign Minister Charles Samba Sissoko, who had been Doukara and allies' pick for Traore's replacement, was arrested in March. Doukara was sentenced to death for political crimes, including embezzling nine million dollars in funds, but this was commuted to a life sentence by the Supreme Court in 1979. \n\nDoukara and Bagayoko were sentenced to the salt mines in Taoudenni, and were tortured to death in 1983. On August 19, 1983, Doukara was personally isolated into a room, where Malian soldiers took turns beating him.

        "content": " Colored Symmetry is a book by A.V. Shubnikov and N.V. Belov and published by Pergamon Press in 1964. The book contains translations of materials originally written in Russian and published between 1951 and 1958. The book was notable because it gave English-language speakers access to new work in the fields of  dichromatic and polychromatic symmetry.\n\nStructure and topics\nThe book is divided into two parts. The first part is a translation into English of A.V. Shubnikov's book Symmetry and antisymmetry of finite figures (Russian: Симметрия и антисимметрия конечных фигур) originally published in 1951. As the editor says in his preface, this book rekindled interest in the field of antisymmetry after a break of 20 years.  The book defines symmetry elements, operations and groups; it then introduces the concept of antisymmetry, and derives the full set of dichromatic three-dimensional point groups. A paper entitled Antisymmetry of textures is appended to part 1; it analyzes the antisymmetry of groups containing infinity-fold axes.\n\nThe second part, entitled Infinite groups of colored symmetry, consists of translations of six papers by N.V. Belov and his co-workers in the new field of polychromatic symmetry. These papers cover the derivation of the 42 magnetic Bravais lattices and the 1651 magnetic space groups, the 46 dichromatic plane groups, mosaics for the 46 dichromatic plane groups, one-dimensional infinite crystallographic groups, polychromatic plane groups, and three-dimensional mosaics with colored symmetry.\n\nAudience\n\nThe book is written for crystallographers, mathematicians and physics researchers who are interested in the application of color symmetry to crystal structure analysis and physics experiments involving magnetic or ferroelectric materials.\n\nReception\nThe book had a mixed reception from reviewers. Allen Nussbaum in American Scientist praised the editor for constructing a consistent story from the original works, but criticised the papers in part two for being difficult to read. G.S. Pawley in a review for Science Progress gave credit to the editor for adding the international notation next to the authors' \"retrograde personal notation\". However, he criticised claims that the book is a \"valuable reference book\" as being \"optimistic\". Martin Buerger in an extensive review for Science also offered both praise and criticism. He stated that previous work in the field by William Barlow and H.J. Woods is not given sufficient credit by the authors and is largely missing from the, otherwise full, bibliography.  He praised Shubnikov's book (part 1) as being \"very clearly written, well illustrated, and easy to understand\", but criticised Belov's papers in part 2 because they \"lack a central unifying theme.\" R.J. Davis in a brief review in Mineralogical Magazine said \"this book is therefore unique in English and forms an essential introduction to modern developments in symmetry theory.\" \nInfluence\n\nIn later reviews of the literature by R.L.E. Schwarzenberger and by Branko Grünbaum and G.C. Shephard in their book Tilings and patterns the work of the Russian color symmetry school led by A.V. Shubnikov and N.V. Belov was put into its proper historical context. Schwarzenberger, and Grünbaum and Shephard, give credit to Shubnikov and Belov for relaunching the field of color symmetry after the work of Heinrich Heesch and H.J. Woods in the 1930s was largely ignored. However, they criticise Shubnikov and Belov for taking a crystallographic rather than a group-theoretic approach, and for using their own confusing notation rather than adopting the international standard Hermann–Mauguin notation for crystallographic symmetry elements.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n '' at the Internet Archive\n\nCategory:Mathematics books\nCategory:1964 non-fiction books\nCategory:Symmetry",

        "content": "Stepan Demyanovich Kovnir (1695—1786) was a Ukrainian architect of the 18th century, a master of Ukrainian Baroque. A subject of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, he was the author of many buildings of its architectural complex.\n\n Biography \nHe was born in 1695 in the village of Hvozdiv in the Kyiv region, which belonged to the {{ill|Kyiv Pustinno-Mykyl monastery|uk|Київському Пустинно-Микільському монастирю}} from the 16th century. He worked as a stonemason from a young age.\n\nHe was a subject of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra (although exempted from all monastic duties). Around 1720 , he moved to Kyiv. The monastery suffered a great fire in 1718. Therefore, major reconstruction works were started here, in which Kovnir participated. At first, he worked under the guidance of Gottfried Johann Schädel, Vasily Neyolov, and other professional architects, and over time he himself received the qualification of \"stone construction master\".\n\nIt is believed that the first works of Kovnir were buildings of economic purpose - warehouses, storerooms, a locksmith's shop, a binding shop, a printing house. With the participation of Kovnir, the bell towers at the Near and {{ill|Far Caves|uk|Дальні печери}}, the temple in , the Klov Palace, and other outstanding monuments of the Ukrainian Baroque were built . A striking masterpiece is the Kovniriv building on the territory of the Upper Lavra, a former service monastery building.\n\nThe builder gave almost 40 years of his work to the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra.\n\n Research of life and creativity \nResearch into the life and creative heritage of the master began only in the 20th century . The honor of clarifying many biographical data about Stepan Kovnir belongs to Boris Krytskyi , who in the 1950s and 60s , in particular, found out the year of his birth.\n\nKovnir's creations were admired by Professor Yuri Aseev , who wrote:\n\n Creative heritage \n\n Kyiv:\n Kyiv Pecherska Lavra :\n Kovnir building (1721—73) ;\n bell towers in the Near (1759—62) and Far (1754—61) caves;\n Klov Palace (1754—61, together with Vasyl Neyolov) ;\n the iconostasis of the Church of the Saviour at Berestove ( 1760 , not preserved);\n binding shop (building #13) (1757—70);\n pediments of the Dormition Cathedral (1767-69, together with Y.

He was a general in the Royal Italian Army, and served as the governor of Italian Somaliland from 1 July 1931 to 6 March 1935.\n\nBiography\nRava's political career began in 1919, when he was co-founder of the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento (predecessor of the National Fascist Party) in Rome.Mia Fuller. Moderns Abroad: Architecture, Cities and Italian Imperialism p. 43 () Previously he was a lieutenant during World War I (where he was wounded in combat), and received three decorations for military valor (one silver and two bronze). After 1920 he began a military career in the fascist militias.\n\nIn the Italian colonies he became secretary general of the governor's office of Italian Tripolitania with Emilio De Bono in March 1927. He then assumed the governorship of Italian Somaliland from 1931 to 1935.Salad Mohammed Ali. Huddur & the history of Southern Somalia p. 89 In those years he gave dynamic impetus to agriculture, roads and railways with emphasis on all types of construction in Somalia. In 1933 he promoted the urban remodeling of Mogadishu, which since then began to be called \"the white pearl of the Indian Ocean\" and became populated with a large minority (40% of the total inhabitants) of Italian settlers.\n\nHe was appointed as Senator of the Kingdom upon his return to Italy in 1936.\n\nHe fell into political disgrace in 1938 for being Jewish, due to Fascist Italy's alliance with Nazi Germany and Hitler. But Mussolini always protected him and never revoked his positions within the National Fascist Party.\n\nHe was also a brigadier general (of the Blackshirts) of the Royal Italian ArmyTreccani: M. Rava and died in Rome on 22 January 1941 as a result of wounds received in the Battle of Bardia (in Italian Libya), during the British offensive called \"Operation Compass\".\n\nPublications\nMaurizio Rava wrote several books. The most famous are:\n\n Al lago Tsana (il mar profondo d'Etiopia) (published in 1913). \n\n l'Eritrea; la nostra colonia primogenita (published in 1923). \n\n Somalia; Parole ai Coloniali (published in 1935).\n\n Other minor works are: \"Ingiustizia delle sanzioni: l’Italia stato aggredito\", Rome 1936; \"Il problema della mano d’opera in Somalia\", Rome 1937; \"Ovest etiopico: nei paesi del platino e dell’oro\", Rome 1938; \"Politica sociale verso gli indigeni e modi di collaborazione con essi\", Rome 1938; \"Diario di un secondo viaggio nell’ovest etiopico\", Rome 1939.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1878 births\nCategory:1941 deaths\nCategory:People from Milan\nCategory:Jewish fascists\nCategory:Italian military personnel of World War I\nCategory:Italian military personnel of World War II\nCategory:Governors of Italian Somaliland\nCategory:People of former Italian colonies",

        "content": "The Hermitage of Barranco (), formerly known as the Templo de la Santísima Cruz and later as Santísima Cruz de Barranco, is a Catholic church building in Barranco District, Lima, Peru. It is located in the district's historic centre and once served as the district's capital and cathedral, next to the Bridge of Sighs, and has been closed since 1974 due to the damages caused by that year's earthquake.\n\nThe Plazuela Chabuca Granda, named after the Peruvian singer who dedicated a song to the bridge, serves as the main public area outside the church and features two statues by sculptor Fausto Jaulis dedicated to Granda and José Antonio de Lavalle y García, the subject of another song of hers.\n\nHistory\nThe location of the church is traditionally considered the origin of the district, with an 18th-century legend claiming that two indian fishermen who had become lost at sea managed to find their way to the shore through a light cast by a cross located there.\n\nThe church was built in the mid-18th century as a small chapel where humble fishermen and travelers attended mass, financed by a Mr. Caicedo, a baker and devout Catholic. Caicedo died at the end of the century, leaving the project incomplete, which was finished with the name of Templo de la Santísima Cruz in honour of the fishermen's miracle.\n\nIn 1874, it was chosen as the centre and capital of the town of San José de Surco, created by Manuel Pardo y Lavalle on October 26, with the neighbourhoods of Talana, Condesa, Ollería, Tejada, Larrión and Pacayar under its jurisdiction, bordered to the north by the Quebrada honda de Armendáriz and the chacra del Cuadrado to the south.\n\nOn January 14, 1881, the unfinished church was looted and destroyed by a fire, both perpetrated by the Chilean Army, during the War of the Pacific, it was rebuilt in 1882 through funds acquired by Chaplain Manuel de la Fuente Chávez from local donations and some funds from Patricio Lynch.\n\nOn December 12, 1903, the archbishop of Lima accepted the district's 1900 request that the church be elevated to a parish, independent from Surco and Chorrillos, with the temple now known as the Santísima Cruz de Barranco and under the direction of de la Fuente (1903–1913, died in office). After de la Fuente's death, he was succeeded by the Spaniard Santiago Roca (1914–1937).\n\nThe church was damaged during the 1940 Lima earthquake, leading to a request being made to the archbishop, requesting his authorisation to build a new church, which was granted in 1942 and consecrated by Juan Landázuri Ricketts in 1963. The original church was declared a historic monument subject to the care of the National Conservation Council, and renovated in 1960 by th pro-restoration committee established by architect Alberto Aranzaens in 1957. In was subsequently declared part of the cultural heritage of Peru in 1972, through Supreme Resolution 2972-ED.\n\nIt was again damaged during the 1974 Lima earthquake and has since been closed to the public.\n\nSee also\nBridge of Sighs (Lima)\n1974 Lima earthquake\nChabuca Granda\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Roman Catholic churches in Lima\nCategory:Barranco District",

        "content": "The Batrachospermum (Roth) is a genus of red algae from the family Batrachospermaceae. Due to its complex biological life cycle, descriptions of the taxon typically focus on gametophytes, while sporophytes, i.e., carposporophytes, are filamentous structures growing on the gametophyte, on which they depend. Independently living sporophytes have sometimes been described as separate species within the genus Chantransia. Additionally, differences may occur in the descriptions of the genus due to variations in taxonomic approaches, as new taxonomic techniques, as with other algae, result in changes in the assignment of individual species to the genus Batrachospermum. The genus is cosmopolitan, and its representatives are found in freshwater environments, mainly rivers, and less frequently in standing waters. These plants have thalli in the form of gelatinous-coated filaments.\n\ncopy of infobox\n\n Name \nThe etymology of the scientific name ( – frog,  – seed) refers to its gelatinous appearance resembling frog spawn. The Polish name, żabirośl (frogseed) also allude to this appearance.\n\n Systematics and variability \nThe genus Batrachospermum was established by Albrecht Wilhelm Roth at the end of the 18th century, described in his work Bemerkungen über das Studium der cryptogamischen Wassergewächse (Remarks on the study of cryptogamic aquatic plants). Previously, botanists described these algae as species belonging to the genera Conferva (now not recognized, with its representatives mainly classified under the genus Cladophora) – Conferva gelatinosa or Conferva nodosa (Carl Linnaeus), or Charales – Chara batrachosperma (Friedrich Wilhelm Weiss). Initially, Roth used the name Chara gelatinosa. The binomial nomenclature were first used in 1801 by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, who distinguished three species: B. gelatinosum, B. simplex, and B. nigricans. Thus, B. gelatinosum became the type species (holotype) of its genus, with the basionym being Conferva gelatinosa (L. 1753: 1166).\n\nIn older systems (e.g., Engler system), the genera Batrachospermum and Chantransia were classified under the family Helminthocladiaceae in the order Nemalionales. Currently, the family Batrachospermaceae and the order Batrachospermales are recognized. According to some systematic proposals, this order is monotypic, and families distinguished within it, such as Lemaneaceae, should be synonymized with Batrachospermaceae.\n\nDepending on the systematic approach, there are from several dozen to several hundred species within the genus. The development of molecular phylogenetics has challenged the traditional morphology and anatomy-based taxonomy. According to these studies, the genus Batrachospermum is paraphyletic – nested within its clade are genera such as Lemanea, Nothocladus, Paralemanea, Petrohua, Psilosiphon, Sirodotia, and Tuomeya. In order to maintain the genus as a monophyletic taxon in a broad sense, all the above-mentioned genera are included in Batrachospermum, or in a narrow sense, only the type species, B. gelatinosum, is included, with its recognized form (sometimes elevated to the species rank) B. gelatinosum f. spermatoinvolucrum (M.L.Vis & R.G.Sheath). In the narrow sense, the previously distinguished sections are elevated to the rank of genera, for example, the Hybrida section (previously distinguished as the Contorta section) is raised to the genus Kumanoa. According to one proposal, the paraphyletic genus Batrachospermum can be divided into the following sections:\n\n Acarposporophytum (Batrachospermum brasiliense)\n Aristata (Batrachospermum cayennense)\n Batrachospermum (Batrachospermum gelatinosum)\n Gonimopropagulum (Batrachospermum breutelli)\n Helminthoidea (Batrachospermum arcuatum, Batrachospermum boryanum, Batrachospermum confusum, Batrachospermum heterocorticum, Batrachospermum involutum)\n Macrospora (Batrachospermum macrosporum)\n Setacea (Batrachospermum atrum, Batrachospermum puiggarianum)\n Turfosa (Batrachospermum turfosum)\n Virescentia (Batrachospermum elegans, Batrachospermum helminthosum)\n\nAdditionally, there is a provisionally designated Australasian group, which is paraphyletic and from which the genera Nothocladus and Petrohua, as well as the Setacea section (Batrachospermum antipodites, Batrachospermum campyloclonum, Batrachospermum discors, Batrachospermum kraftii, Batrachospermum pseudogelatinosum, Batrachospermum theaquum, Batrachospermum wattsii), originate.\n\nAfter the separation of the genus Kumanoa, the following species formerly classified under Batrachospermum are transferred to this genus: B. australicum (Kumanoa australica), B. breviarticulatum (Kumanoa breviarticulata), B. cipoense (Kumanoa cipoensis), B. deminutum (Kumanoa deminuta), B. equisetoideum (Kumanoa equisetoidea), B. globosporum (Kumanoa globospora), B. gracillimum (Kumanoa gracillima), B. intortum (Kumanoa intorta), B. louisianae (Kumanoa louisianae), B. nodiflorum (Kumanoa nodiflora), B. procarpum (Kumanoa procarpa), B. spermatiophorum (Kumanoa spermatiophora), B. virgatodecaisneanum (Kumanoa virgatodecaisneana), B. vittatum (Kumanoa vittata).\n\nAfter considering almost all of these changes, in the AlgaeBase system, in addition to those mentioned above, the following species were verified as of autumn 2011 (others appearing in publications are either considered synonyms of others or not yet verified):\n Batrachospermum androinvolucrum\n Batrachospermum antiquum\n Batrachospermum azeredoi\n Batrachospermum bakarense\n Batrachospermum beraense\n Batrachospermum carpocontortum\n Batrachospermum carpoinvolucrum\n Batrachospermum crispatum\n Batrachospermum curvatum\n Batrachospermum cylindrocellulare\n Batrachospermum dasyphyllum\n Batrachospermum debile\n Batrachospermum deminutum\n Batrachospermum desikacharyi\n Batrachospermum diatyches\n Batrachospermum equisetifolium\n Batrachospermum ferreri\n Batrachospermum fluitans\n Batrachospermum gombakense\n Batrachospermum guianense\n Batrachospermum gulbenkianum\n Batrachospermum henriquesianum\n Batrachospermum heteromorphum\n Batrachospermum hirosei\n Batrachospermum hondongense\n Batrachospermum hypogynum\n Batrachospermum iriomotense\n Batrachospermum iyengarii\n Batrachospermum keratophytum (according to some molecular studies, despite minor morphological distinctiveness, it should be included in the species B. turfosum)\n Batrachospermum kushiroense\n Batrachospermum kylinii\n Batrachospermum latericium\n Batrachospermum lochmodes Batrachospermum longiarticulatum\n Batrachospermum longipedicellatum\n Batrachospermum luisitanicum\n Batrachospermum mahabaleshwarense\n Batrachospermum mahlacense\n Batrachospermum microspermum\n Batrachospermum nechochoense\n Batrachospermum nonocense\n Batrachospermum nova-guineense\n Batrachospermum orthostichum\n Batrachospermum periplocum\n Batrachospermum prominens\n Batrachospermum pseudocarpum\n Batrachospermum pulchrum\n Batrachospermum ranuliferum\n Batrachospermum sinensis\n Batrachospermum skujae\n Batrachospermum tabagatenense\n Batrachospermum tapirense\n Batrachospermum terawhiticum\n Batrachospermum tiomanense\n Batrachospermum torridum\n Batrachospermum torsivum\n Batrachospermum tortuosum\n Batrachospermum transtaganum\n Batrachospermum trichocontortum\n Batrachospermum trichofurcatum\n Batrachospermum triste\n Batrachospermum turgidum\n Batrachospermum vagum var. undulato-pedicellatum (while the proper species B. vagum was considered a synonym of B. turfosum)\n Batrachospermum vogesiacum\n Batrachospermum woitapense\n Batrachospermum zeylanicum\n Batrachospermum zostericola\nOne of the more commonly reported species in publications, B. moniliforme, is considered a synonym of B. gelatinosum in this system.\n\n Morphology \n\n Habit \nThe thallus is filamentous, covered with a slippery, gelatinous sheath, with mucilage primarily composed of oligosaccharides. The degree of gelatinosity of the thallus varies between species. Species occurring in swifter currents typically have a more compact form, while those in slower currents have a looser form.\n\nThe gametophyte thallus is filamentous, up to 40 cm long (usually shorter in many species), typically branching monopodially to dichotomy. Downward-growing filaments form the covering cortex around the central filament, sometimes resembling rhizoids in the lower part. Nodes occur between the cells of the main filament, from which lateral filaments grow radially. From the cortex filaments situated on the internodes, intercortical filaments also arise. Lateral cortical filaments are more branched and longer than intercortical ones. Younger thalli usually form broader branches (up to 350 μm wide) than older ones (100–200 μm).\n\nThe color varies, ranging from brownish, olive, purple, gray to bluish-green.\n\nThe sporophyte stage is crustose, consisting of large basal cells from which poorly branched filaments grow upwards.\n\n Anatomy \nThe cells of the main filament are elongated (150–200 μm) in shape of a cylinder. The cells of the cortical filaments are lens-shaped, ellipsoidal, up to 30 μm in length. Each cell contains several ribbon-shaped chloroplasts without pyrenoids. The chloroplasts contain a single fragmented thylakoid. Among the metabolites, in addition to substances typical for all red algae (such as red algal starch), trehalose is present. The number of chromosomes (n) varies, depending on the species, ranging from 2 to 22.\n\n Structures for propagation \nSeveral species produce monospores, but usually carpospores are formed. Spermatangia (male gametangia) are spherical (4–8 µm in diameter) and colorless, usually clustered at the end of filaments, sometimes also on branches carrying carpogonia. Male gametes are non-motile gametangia. Female gametes – carpogonia – are essentially equivalent to oogonia. The hair of the carpogonium is club-shaped. Carposporophytes are roughly spherical, formed by gonimoblasts, with carposporangia at the tips (lacking cystocarp). In Batrachospermum breutelli, the carposporophyte produces multicellular diaspores that detach. Spores do not have any endosporic features.\n\n Ecology \nIn defining environmental requirements, taxonomic controversies pose a certain difficulty. It happens that a particular species is considered by ecologists as an indicator of a certain environmental condition, while another species is considered an indicator of a different condition. However, both of these species may turn out to be synonymous to each other as a result of molecular studies.\n\n Geographical distribution \nThe genus is freshwater and cosmopolitan. Since red algae are mostly found in saltwater environments, in some regions, representatives of Batrachospermum are the most common riverine red algae. This is the case with Batrachospermum gelatinosum, which was found in 13% of samples collected from North American streams. In the streams of the upper São Francisco basin in Brazil, various species of Batrachospermum, especially in the thallus stage, are one of the most common taxonomic groups of macroalgae. In Poland, occurrences are scattered throughout the country, with more frequent sightings in the Pomerania region and in the Silesian-Lesser Poland Uplands.\n\nSome species, such as B. gelatinosum, are found on all continents (except Antarctica), while others are endemic (e.g., Batrachospermum spermatiophorum known only from one stream on Maui Island), although according to some proposals, it may be transferred to the genus Kumanoa.\n\n Habitat \nSpecies of Batrachospermum inhabit the benthos of moderately to swiftly flowing waters (average flow velocity – 19 cm/s) with a substrate of gravelly or stony bottoms, and even in springs. They are rarely found in standing waters. The substrate to which they are attached can vary from stones to macrophytes, especially among different species. Representatives are often rheophiles or rheobionts and live in waters with a wide range of current velocities, but with averages exceeding 40 cm/s (e.g., Batrachospermum boryanum), or even 50 cm/s (B. keratophytum, which also occurs in ponds). Due to the high oxygenation typical of such conditions, they exhibit characteristics of organisms highly tolerant to oxygen, and a decrease in oxygen concentration results in a decrease in respiratory rate. These conditions favor rapid water self-purification, especially from organic pollutants, so these species are recognized as saprobic systems (B. vagum) or saproxenes (B. moniliforme, also known as B. gelatinosum), although the latter species may also indicate γ-mesosaprobic waters. They mainly occur in waters with low mineral content. Unlike most algae, they do not assimilate carbon bound in carbonate ions, so they require dissolved CO2. As a result, despite their ability to occur in waters with different pH levels, they are more common in acidic waters, where such a form of inorganic carbon predominates. Some representatives (B. keratophytum, B. vagum – both species sometimes considered synonyms of B. turfosum) occur in dystrophic waters, with low transparency, but they can also occur in swiftly flowing waters. Even then, however, they are more common in streams with water rich in humic compounds – more acidic and darker than average. Also, representatives of some other species have a wide range of tolerance to sunlight, pH, and other parameters. This applies especially to B. gelatinosum, the only representative of the genus occurring up to the tundra zone, and described under synonymous names (B. delicatulum) also from tropical zones. This species is sometimes described as typical for both eutrophic and oligotrophic waters.\n\nThallus and gametophyte stages can occur in different habitat conditions. It happens that only one of these generations is observed in certain regions.\n\n Interspecies interactions \nThe thalli of Batrachospermum are a food source for aquatic invertebrates, including amphipods, snails, and aquatic insect larvae. In some studies, they have been found in the gut content of almost half of the examined individuals.\n\nThe silk-like secretions that bind the threads of Batrachospermum are used to build shelters by some chironomidic larvae. Shelters made from different species of Batrachospermum have slightly different structures.\n\nThe gelatinous sheath serves as a habitat for periphytic algae, such as Chrysodesmis gloeophila. Some algae, such as the red algae Balbiania and Sirodotia, can also grow directly on the gelatinous thalli of Batrachospermum.\n\n Life cycle \nThe Batrachospermum, like other red algae, undergoes an alternation of generations. The life cycle involves one haploid generation of gametophyte (typically described as the actual individual of Batrachospermum) and two diploid generations of sporophytes – carposporophyte and Chantransia (or pseudochantransia).\n\nThe Chantransia stage is annual. Chantransia can produce monospores or, through meiotic division, produce gametophyte thalli growing on it, without releasing tetraspores. Gametophytes live for a short period – from late autumn to early spring in tropical regions or slightly longer in temperate zones. However, in certain conditions, they can also be perennial. The production of gametophytes may be associated with photoperiodism. Gametophytes produce male gametes – spermatozoids and female gametes – carpogonia (which are essentially identical to oogonia). Some species (e.g., Batrachospermum boryanum) are dioecious, while others are monoicous. In some species (e.g., B. delicatulum, also known as B. gelatinosum), both monoicious and dioecious individuals occur. Both types of gametes are non-motile – spermatozoids are released into the water and carried by its movement, while carpogonia remain on the parent plant, germinating into carposporophytes after fertilization. Carposporophytes, originating from the zygote, are diploids. Due to their inconspicuous appearance and occurrence on gametophytes, they were once considered parasites. However, sometimes they detach from the gametophyte, serving as diaspores. Carposporophytes produce carpospores released into the water, from which the Chantransia stage germinates. An exception is Batrachospermum brasiliense, in which there is no carposporophyte, and the Chantransia stage grows directly from the fertilized carpogonium. Since the gametophyte grows on the Chantransia, the carposporophyte on the gametophyte, and the carpospores can germinate on the parent plant, their common body can be considered a kind of chimera.\n\nFor many years, it was believed that the only diploid stage in the development of Batrachospermum is the zygote, which immediately undergoes meiosis, making the carposporophyte haplont. Such information is still presented in relatively modern studies, despite the fact that since the mid-20th century, it has been discovered that successive species representing this life cycle model (supposedly represented by the genus Nemalion) actually have a model similar to most other red algae (typified by Polysiphonia). Additional misunderstandings arose from the fact that after meiosis in Chantransia (or pseudochantransia), only one cell (meiospore) gives rise to a new individual, while the rest degenerate, which is unusual in algae. Moreover, the meiospore is not released but germinates on the parent plant. It was only in the late 1960s and early 1970s that it was proven that the nuclei of Batrachospermum and Lemanea gametophytes contain half of the DNA of the nuclei of individuals from the supposed genus Pesudochantransia.\n\n Uses \nUnlike some marine red algae, Batrachospermum is not used in cooking. There are few reports of the anti-inflammatory properties of B. atrum used in folk medicine at the foothills of the Himalayas (Arunachal Pradesh).\n\nDue to its environmental requirements, representatives of this genus found in Poland are considered when determining the River Macrophyte Index, with values of W=6 (indicating a preference for mesotrophic waters) and L=2 (indicating an average range of ecological tolerance).\n\n References \n\nCategory:Red algae\nCategory:Algae\nCategory:Red algae genera",

        "content": "May I Kill U? is a 2012 British black comedy film directed by Stuart Urban.  A horror-edged satire of right-wing politics and the idea of broken Britain, the film follows a police constable and rogue vigilante cyclist (played by comedian Kevin Bishop) who gains social media fame serial killing \"scumbags\" and posting the videos on YouTube and Twitter.  The film debuted at the FrightFest film festival in 2012 before receiving a theatrical release in the United Kingdom and a limited theatrical release in the United States in 2014, where it received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics.\n\nReception\nMay I Kill U? received largely scathing reviews from critics, with only a small number of less-negative reviews.  The film holds a 13% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 7 out of 100 score (indicating \"Universal dislike or disgust\") on Metacritic.  \n\nReviews from British critics were overwhelmingly negative.  The Guardian'''s film critic Peter Bradshaw described May I Kill U? as \"one of those British indie films that come nowhere near the standard of the most ordinary telly drama.\"  A separate Guardian review from Philip French was one of the film's only positive reviews, describing the film as \"funny, sharp and ruthless.\"  Empire stated: \"Setting out to be a killer-cop satire for the social media age, the result makes Paul Blart look like Taxi Driver.  Unfollow immediately.\"  Total Film described May I Kill U? as \"a satire so blunt it makes an early - but compelling - case for most misguided film of 2013.\"  The List opined that \"There's little actual humour in May I Kill U?, just a grim view of police-work, deprivation, social media and modern life generally.\"  The Daily Telegraph stated that \"There may well be a worse film released this year than this unwatchable British black comedy, although it sets a terrifyingly low benchmark.\"  The Daily Express described the film as \"a tacky, low-budget film that is as blunt and obvious as the instruments Baz uses on his victims.\"  The Evening Standard stated that \"The joke barely lasts the film’s short running time, but that is mitigated by performances from Bishop, Frances Barber as his slovenly mum and Rosemary Leach as an old lady who beats him at his own game.\"  The Sun described the film as \"a dumb farce which is neither funny or scary.\"  Little White Lies described the film as \"A spoof of right-wing reactionary politics that feels better suited to television than cinema\" and stated: \"At times, it feels like a relative of superlative Belgian serial killer comedy, Man Bites Dog, though a rather toothless distant cousin.  Urban’s film trades in absurdist humour and knowing clichés but never ventures into the darker territory the material is calling out for.  May I Kill U? looks very much like it was made for Channel 4 as post-pub fodder.\"  Metro called the film \"a flat-footed satire of the London riots\".  Contactmusic.com awarded the film 3 stars out of 5, stating: \"A pitch-black sense of humour provides some strong laughs in this satirical British thriller, but the undercooked script never manages to hold onto our interest. Packed with coincidences and contrivances, the story is just too sloppy, even if there's a provocative point worth making in here somewhere.\"  On Kermode and Mayo's Film Review, Mark Kermode called the film \"one of the most ill-judged films of recent memory\".  Starburst gave the film one of its few largely positive reviews, saying \"May I Kill U? is not at all what you might expect it to be.  It’s witty, snappily directed, surprisingly dark and unexpectedly sad at times.  This very English Bad Lieutenant is a Trending Topic U really should keep your eye on.\"\n\nInternational critics were generally no more forgiving.  The Village Voice stated that \"Urban's stab at black-comedy satire is hobbled by the obviousness of his characters.\"  The Los Angeles Times opened its review of the film with \"The only real response to a thuddingly unfunny vigilante satire like 'May I Kill U' is, 'Well, I hope that filmmaker got something out of his system.'\"  A positive review came from Film Threat, which called the film \"a dark commentary on both the social media fed society at large, and a skewed, contemporary take on the superhero origin story\" and stated that \"the film is visually quite creative and fun to watch.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official site\n \n May I Kill U?'' at AllMovie\n \n \n\nCategory:2012 films\nCategory:2012 black comedy films\nCategory:2012 comedy horror films\nCategory:2012 crime thriller films\nCategory:2010s English-language films\nCategory:2010s crime comedy films\nCategory:2010s crime thriller films\nCategory:2010s comedy horror films\nCategory:2010s serial killer films\nCategory:2010s vigilante films\nCategory:2010s British films\nCategory:2010s political satire films\nCategory:British independent films\nCategory:British vigilante films\nCategory:British black comedy films\nCategory:British police films\nCategory:British crime comedy films\nCategory:British comedy horror films\nCategory:British crime thriller films\nCategory:British serial killer films\nCategory:British political satire films\nCategory:Films about snuff films\nCategory:Films about murderers\nCategory:Techno-horror films\nCategory:Techno-thriller films\nCategory:Films about social media\nCategory:Films about police officers\nCategory:Films about police corruption\nCategory:Cycling films",

The Dyngjufjöll is a volcanic mountain range in the northeast of Iceland which belongs to the Askja volcanic system. Sometimes called Dyngjufjöll, it is part of the Vatnajökull National Park. The Askja caldera is also located there.\n\nLocation \nThe huge mountain massif is located in the highlands of Iceland , more precisely in the Ódáðahraun and covers around 600 km². It forms an almost perfect square with a side length of around 24 km.\n\nVatnajökull with its Dyngjujökull glacier tongue is 15 km south of the mountains.\n\nOn the west side, the Dyngjudalur valley cuts into the mountains, so that this is called the Vestari-Dyngjufjöll . These also include the central volcano of the Askja volcanic system.\n\nGeography\nthumb|250px|Öskjuvatn caldera\nMany peaks in Dyngjufjöll reach between 1,300 and 1,500 m and thus rise above the bottom of the Askja Caldera by around 100 - 300 m.\n\nThe highest peak is Þorvaldstindur with a height of 1,510 m. It is named after an Icelandic geologist, Þorvaldur Thoroddsen.Íslandshandbókin. Náttúra, saga og sérkenni 2.bindi. Hg. T. Einarsson, H.

Facetten der Geologie Islands. Reykjavík 2007, S. 198.\n\nThe mountains are mostly made of palagonite . They appear to be the remains of a large Ice Age stratovolcano. But since then the volcano has continued to work steadily, so that thick layers of lava and ash cover the palagonite in most places.\n\nOne of the passes between the peaks, Jónsskarð, is ​​also named after an Icelandic geologist, Jón Þorkelsson, who was the first to describe the Askja volcano. He examined it after the great eruption of 1875. The lowest pass between these mountains, which also form the edge of the Askja caldera, is the Öskjuop.\n\nHere the caldera opens to the east and a hiking trail leads through it to Lake Öskjuvatn.Íslandshandbókin.

Two German researchers, Max Rudloff and Walther von Knebel, who disappeared in the area around this time, probably drowned in this in 1907 . Knebel's fiancée, Ina von Grumbkow, organized an unsuccessful search expedition the next year, in which she also took part.vgl. z. B. http://isafold.de/klassiker/grumbkow/default.htm, abgerufen am 25.

        "content": "Kesteven 75, abbreviated as Kes 75 and also called SNR G029.7-00.3, G29.7-0.3 and 4C -03.70​, is a supernova remnant located in the constellation Aquila.\n\n Morphology \nKesteven 75 is a supernova remnant of composite morphology. In the radio band, it shows a shell or partial shell of about 90 arcseconds in radius, with a central nebula of about 25 × 35 arcseconds. The complete absence of emission in the eastern part indicates a strong density gradient of the interstellar medium where Kesteven 75 expands. The central component has been observed to have a flat radio spectrum with substantial polarization, which is characteristic of a pulsar or plerion wind nebula. The expansion speed of this plerion is approximately 1000 km/s. \n\nX-ray observations with the ASCA and Chandra observatories also show the composite nature of Kesteven 75, its morphology being very similar to that of radio frequencies. The emission from the shell of Kesteven 75 is mainly concentrated in two regions, to the southeast and southwest. Likewise, a \"jet\"-torus structure, common in young plerions, has been identified. According to certain observations of Chandra, the spectra of the shell can be explained by a thermal model of two temperatures, possibly associated on the one hand with the impacted material, and on the other with the ejecta material that has suffered a second impact due to the reverse shock.\n\nThe infrared emission from the shell is spatially correlated with the X-ray emission, suggesting that the dust particles are heated by the collision of gas previously heated by the X-rays. This dust reaches a temperature of 140 K due to upon collision with a hot and relatively dense plasma.​ \n\nKesteven 75 has also been detected in the gamma ray region between 20 and 200 keV with the INTEGRAL space observatory, and between 0.3 and 5 TeV with the H.E.S.S telescope system.\n\n Progenitor \nBased on the high velocity of the ejecta and the low density implied by the initially estimated distance (much greater than currently accepted), it has been suggested that Kesteven 75 comes from a type Ib/c supernova explosion. However, subsequent studies have proposed that Kesteven 75 is probably the result of a more common type IIP supernova, where the plerion expands into an asymmetric nickel bubble. The parent star is thought to have a mass between 8 and 12 solar masses.\n\n Stellar remnant \nKesteven 75 houses the X-ray pulsar PSR J1846−025, discovered in 2000,​ which provides energy to the plerion. It is a highly energetic stellar remnant (E = 8.3 × 1036 erg/s) whose rotation period is 325 ms. In 2006, it was detected that this pulsar was in an \"active\" or \"flaring\" state, which led to changes in its spectrum, as well as in the morphology of the associated plerion; Fourteen years later, activity was detected again in PSR J1846−025. However, the energetic and spectral properties of this pulsar firmly distinguish it from a magnetar. Its inferred magnetic field (Bs = 4.9 × 1013 G) is the largest among this type of objects, and is probably responsible for the activity intervals discovered, suggesting a transition to a magnetar state.\n\n Distance \nAlthough historically estimates of the distance to Kesteven 75 have varied significantly between 5,000 and 21,000 parsecs, recent analyzes based on H I observations place this supernova remnant at 5,800 ± 500 parsecs from Earth. On the other hand, Kesteven 75 is a very young supernova remnant, with an age of less than 840 years. ​The study of the expansion of the plerion over 10 years has allowed us to limit the age of this remnant to 480 ± 50 years . Consequently, Kesteven 75 contains the youngest plerion in our galaxy.\n\n See also \n\n List of supernova remnants\n\n External links \n\n Kesteven 75 at SIMBAD\n\n References \n\nCategory:Former objects\nCategory:Explosions\nCategory:Astronomical events\nCategory:Supernovae\nCategory:Supernova remnants",

        "content": "Y, or y, is the twenty-fifth and penultimate letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. According to some authorities, it is the sixth (or seventh if including W) vowel letter of the English alphabet. Its name in English is wyeAlso spelled wy, plural wyes. (pronounced ), plural wyes.\"Y\", Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition (1989); Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged (1993); \"wy\", op. cit.\n\nIn the English writing system, it mostly represents a vowel and seldom a consonant, and in other orthographies it may represent a vowel or a consonant.\n\nName\nIn Latin, Y was named I graeca (\"Greek I\"), since the classical Greek sound , similar to modern German ü or French u, was not a native sound for Latin speakers, and the letter was initially only used to spell foreign words. This history has led to the standard modern names of the letter in Romance languages – i grego in Galician, i grega in Catalan, i grec in French and Romanian, i greca in Italian – all meaning \"Greek I\". The names igrek in Polish and  in Vietnamese are both phonetic borrowings of the French name. In Dutch, the letter is either only found in loanwords, or is practically equivalent to the digraph IJ. Hence, both Griekse ij and i-grec are used, as well as ypsilon. In Spanish, Y is also called i griega; however, in the twentieth century, the shorter name ye was proposed and was officially recognized as its name in 2010 by the Real Academia Española, although its original name is still accepted.\n\nThe original Greek name υ ψιλόν (upsilon) has also been adapted into several modern languages. For example, it is called Ypsilon in German, ypsilon in Dutch,  i in Icelandic. Both names are used in Italian, ipsilon or i greca; likewise in Portuguese, ípsilon or i grego. In Faroese, the letter is simply called seinna i (\"later i\") because of its later place in the alphabet. France has a commune called Y, pronounced , whose inhabitants goes by the demonym upsilonienne/upsilonien in feminine and masculine form respectively.\n\nHistory\n Proto-Sinaitic Phoenicianwaw Western GreekUpsilon LatinY 40px frameless|40x40px 40px x30px|Latin Y\nThe oldest direct ancestor of the letter Y was the Semitic letter waw (pronounced as ), from which also come F, U, V, and W. See F for details. The Greek and Latin alphabets developed from the Phoenician form of this early alphabet.\n\nThe form of the modern letter Y is derived from the Greek letter upsilon. It dates back to the Latin of the first century BC, when upsilon was introduced a second time, this time with its \"foot\" to distinguish it. It was used to transcribe loanwords from the prestigious Attic dialect of Greek, which had the non-Latin vowel sound  (as found in modern French cru (raw), or German grün (green)) in words that had been pronounced with  in earlier Greek. Because  was not a native sound of Latin, Latin speakers had trouble pronouncing it, and it was usually pronounced . Some Latin words of Italic origin also came to be spelled with 'y': Latin silva ('forest') was commonly spelled sylva, in analogy with the Greek cognate and synonym ὕλη.Oxford English Dictionary Second edition, 1989; online version June 2011, s.v. 'sylva'\n\nEnglish\n\n+Summary of the sources of Modern English \"Y\" Phoenician  Greek  Latin   English (approximate times of changes) Old  Middle  Modern 75px  100px  V → U →  V/U/VV/UU → V/U/W Y →  Y (vowel ) →  Y (vowel ) →  Y (vowels) 75px 100px  C → G → Ᵹ (consonantal ,  or ) → Ȝ (consonantal ,  or ) →G/GHY (consonant)\n\nVowel\nThe letter Y was used to represent the sound  in Old English, so Latin ,  and  were all used to represent distinct vowel sounds. But, by the time of Middle English,  had lost its roundedness and became identical to  ( and ). Therefore, many words that originally had  were spelled with , and vice versa.\n\nIn Modern English,  can represent the same vowel sounds as the letter . The use of  to represent a vowel is more restricted in Modern English than it was in Middle and early Modern English. It occurs mainly in the following three environments: for upsilon in Greek loan-words (system: Greek σύστημα), at the end of a word (rye, city; compare cities, where S is final), and in place of I before the ending -ing (dy-ing, justify-ing).\n\nConsonant\nAs a consonant in English,  normally represents a palatal approximant,  (year, yore). In this usage, the letter Y has replaced the Middle English letter yogh (Ȝȝ), which developed from the letter G, ultimately from Semitic gimel. Yogh could also represent other sounds, such as , which came to be written gh in Middle English.\n\nConfusion in writing with the letter thorn\nWhen printing was introduced to Great Britain, Caxton and other English printers used Y in place of Þ (thorn: Modern English th), which did not exist in continental typefaces. From this convention comes the spelling of the as ye in the mock archaism Ye Olde Shoppe. But, in spite of the spelling, pronunciation was the same as for modern the (stressed , unstressed ). Pronouncing the article ye as yee () is purely a modern spelling pronunciation.\n\nOther languages\nIn some of the Nordic languages,  is used to represent the sound . The distinction between  and  has been lost in Icelandic and Faroese, making the distinction purely orthographic and historical. A similar merger of  into  happened in Greek around the beginning of the 2nd millennium, making the distinction between iota (Ι, ι) and upsilon (Υ, υ) purely a matter of historical spelling there as well. The distinction is retained in Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish.\n\nIn the West Slavic languages,  was adopted as a sign for the close central unrounded vowel ; later,  merged with  in Czech and Slovak, whereas Polish retains it with the pronunciation . Similarly, in Middle Welsh,  came to be used to designate the vowels  and  in a way predictable from the position  of the vowel in the word. Since then,  has merged with  in Southern Welsh dialects, but  is retained.\n\nUse in writing systems\n+Pronunciation summary Languages in italics are not usually written using the Latin alphabetLanguageDialect(s)Pronunciation (IPA)EnvironmentNotesAfrikaansAlbanianAzerbaijaniChamorroMandarin ChineseStandardPinyin romanizationCornishUsuallyBefore multiple consonantsBefore vowelsCzechDanishBefore multiple consonants UsuallyDutchVariant writing of , , In loanwordsEnglish, , , See English orthography, Before Before a vowelFaroeseBefore two consonantsUsuallyFinnish GermanAlemannicStandardIn some wordsBefore two consonantsUsuallyGuaraniIcelandicDifferenciated from  in writing with an acute accent, as Khasi before vowelsLithuanianMalagasy Only used word finallyManxNorwegianUsuallyBefore multiple consonantsPolishSlovakSpanishSwedishBefore multiple consonantsUsually In loanwordsTurkishTurkmenUzbekVietnameseWelshNorthern, , See Welsh orthographySouthern, , ,    \n\nEnglish\nAs :\n at the beginning of a word as in yes\n at the beginning of a syllable before a vowel as in beyond, lawyer, canyon\nAs :\n under stress in an open syllable as in my, type, rye, lying, pyre, tyre, typhoon\n in a stressed open syllable as in hyphen, cycle, cylon\n in a pretonic open syllable as in hypothesis, psychologist\n word-finally after a consonant, as in ally, unify\nAs :\n without stress at the end of multi-syllable word, as in happy, baby, lucky, accuracy\n used as a diphthong in combination with e at the end of some words, as in money, key, valley\nAs non-syllabic :\n in diphthongs at the end of words, as in play, grey, boy\nAs :\n in a closed syllable without stress and with stress as in myth, system, gymnastics\n in a closed syllable under stress as in typical, lyric\n in an open syllable without stress as in physique, oxygen\nOther:\n combining with  as  under stress (like  in bird), as in myrtle, myrrh\n as  (schwa) in words like martyr\n\nIn English morphology, -y is an adjectival suffix.\n\nY is the ninth least frequently used letter in the English language (after P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, and Z), with a frequency of about 2% in words.\n\nOther languages\nthumb|Pronunciation of written  in European languages (Actual pronunciation may vary)\n represents the sounds  or  (sometimes long) in the Scandinavian languages. In Danish and Swedish, its use as a semivowel is limited to loanwords, whereas in Norwegian, it appears as a semivowel in native words such as høyre .\n\nthumb|Dutch sign \"uitrit vrijlaten\", keep exit clear. Y is traditionally used for IJ, because it looks similar in cursive writing. There is no resemblance in pronounciation; Y is used nearly exclusively in foreign words such as yoga or baby and proncounced accordingly. In the alphabet, Y is indeed pronounced like ij/ei (ay), but the proper name of the letter is i-grec.\nIn Dutch and German,  appears only in loanwords and proper names.\n\nIn Dutch, it usually represents . It may sometimes be left out of the Dutch alphabet and replaced with the  digraph. In addition,  and  are occasionally used instead of Dutch  and , albeit very rarely.\n\nIn German orthography, the pronunciation  has taken hold since the 19th century in classical loanwords – for instance in words like typisch  'typical', Hyäne, Hysterie, mysteriös, Syndrom, System, Typ. It is also used for the sound  in loanwords, such as Yacht (variation spelling: Jacht), Yak, Yeti; however, e.g. yo-yo is spelled \"Jo-Jo\" in German, and yoghurt/yogurt/yoghourt \"Jog(h)urt\" [mostly spelled with h]). The letter  is also used in many geographical names, e.g. Bayern Bavaria, Ägypten Egypt, Libyen Libya, Paraguay, Syrien Syria, Uruguay, Zypern Cyprus (but: Jemen Yemen, Jugoslawien Yugoslavia). Especially in German names, the pronunciations  or  occur as well – for instance in the name Meyer, where it serves as a variant of , cf. Meier, another common spelling of the name. In German the y is preserved in the plural form of some loanwords such as Babys babies and Partys parties, celebrations.\n\nA  that derives from the  ligature occurs in the Afrikaans language, a descendant of Dutch, and in Alemannic German names. In Afrikaans, it denotes the diphthong . In Alemannic German names, it denotes long , for instance in Schnyder  or Schwyz  – the cognate non-Alemannic German names Schneider  or Schweiz  have the diphthong  that developed from long .\n\nIn Hungarian orthography, y is only used in the digraphs \"gy,\" \"ly,\" \"ny,\" \"ty,\" in some surnames (e. g. Bátory), and in foreign words.\n\nIn Icelandic writing system, due to the loss of the Old Norse rounding of the vowel , the letters  and  are now pronounced identically to the letters  and , namely as  and   respectively. The difference in spelling is thus purely etymological. In Faroese, too, the contrast has been lost, and  is always pronounced , whereas the accented versions  and  designate the same diphthong  (shortened to  in some environments). In both languages, it can also form part of diphthongs such as  (in both languages), pronounced , and , pronounced  (Faroese only).\n\nIn French orthography,  is pronounced as  when a vowel (as in the words cycle, y) and as  as a consonant (as in yeux, voyez). It alternates orthographically with  in the conjugations of some verbs, indicating a  sound. In most cases when  follows a vowel, it modifies the pronunciation of the vowel:  ,  ,  . The letter  has double function (modifying the vowel as well as being pronounced as  or ) in the words payer, balayer, moyen, essuyer, pays, etc., but in some words it has only a single function:  in bayer, mayonnaise, coyote; modifying the vowel at the end of proper names like Chardonnay and Fourcroy. In French  can have a diaeresis (tréma) as in Moÿ-de-l'Aisne.\nthumb|This church at Nigrán, Spain, is labeled as . It would be  (\"sanctuary church\") in modern orthography.|alt=A niche with a white statue of Saint James. Under it, the top of a gate is visible. On it is engraved \"YGLESIA DE REFVGIO\"\nIn Spanish,  was used as a word-initial form of  that was more visible. (German has used  in a similar way.) Hence,  was a symbol sharing the initials of Isabella I of Castille () and Ferdinand II of Aragon. This spelling was reformed by the Royal Spanish Academy and currently is only found in proper names spelled archaically, such as Ybarra or CYII, the symbol of the . Appearing alone as a word, the letter  is a grammatical conjunction with the meaning \"and\" in Spanish and is pronounced . As a consonant,  represents  in Spanish. The letter is called , literally meaning \"Greek I\", after the Greek letter ypsilon, or .\n\nIn Portuguese,  (called ípsilon in Brazil, and either ípsilon or i grego in Portugal) was, together with  and , recently reintroduced as the 25th letter, and 19th consonant, of the Portuguese alphabet, in consequence of the Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990. It is mostly used in loanwords from English, Japanese and Spanish. Loanwords in general, primarily gallicisms in both varieties, are more common in Brazilian Portuguese than in European Portuguese. It was always common for Brazilians to stylize Tupi-influenced names of their children with the letter (which is present in most Romanizations of Old Tupi) e.g. Guaracy, Jandyra, Mayara – though placenames and loanwords derived from indigenous origins had the letter substituted for  over time e.g. Nictheroy became Niterói.\nUsual pronunciations are , ,  and  (the two latter ones are inexistent in European and Brazilian Portuguese varieties respectively, being both substituted by  in other dialects). The letters  and  are regarded as phonemically not dissimilar, though the first corresponds to a vowel and the latter to a consonant, and both can correspond to a semivowel depending on its place in a word.\n\nItalian, too, has  (ipsilon) in a small number of loanwords. The letter is also common in some surnames native to the German-speaking province of Bolzano, such as Mayer or Mayr.\n\nIn Guaraní, it represents the vowel .\n\nIn Polish, it represents the vowel  (or, according to some descriptions, ), which is clearly different from , e.g. my (we) and mi (me). No native Polish word begins with ; very few foreign words keep  at the beginning, e.g. yeti (pronounced ).\n\nIn Czech and Slovak, the distinction between the vowels expressed by  and , as well as by   and  has been lost (similarly to Icelandic and Faroese), but the consonants d, t, n (also l in Slovak) before orthographic (and historical)  are not palatalized, whereas they are before . Therefore  is called tvrdé y (hard y), while  is měkké i (soft i).  can never begin any word, while  can never begin a native word. \n\nIn Welsh, it is usually pronounced  in non-final syllables and  or  (depending on the accent) in final syllables.\n\nIn the Standard Written Form of the Cornish Language, it represents the  and  of Revived Middle Cornish and the  and  of Revived Late Cornish. It can also represent Tudor and Revived Late Cornish  and  and consequently be replaced in writing with . It is also used in forming a number of diphthongs. As a consonant it represents .\n\nIn Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Karelian and Albanian,  is always pronounced .\n\nIn Estonian,  is used in foreign proper names and is pronounced as in the source language. It is also unofficially used as a substitute for  and is pronounced the same as in Finnish.\n\nIn Lithuanian,  is the 15th letter (following  and preceding  in the alphabet) and is a vowel. It is called the long i and is pronounced , like in English see.\n\nWhen used as a vowel in Vietnamese, the letter  represents the sound ; when it is a monophthong, it is functionally equivalent to the Vietnamese letter . There have been efforts to replace all such uses with  altogether, but they have been largely unsuccessful. As a consonant, it represents the palatal approximant. The capital letter  is also used in Vietnamese as a given name.\n\nIn Aymara, Indonesian/Malaysian, Turkish, Quechua and the romanization of Japanese, ⟨y⟩ is always a palatal consonant, denoting , as in English.\n\nIn Malagasy, the letter  represents the final variation of .\n\nIn Turkmen,  represents .\n\nIn Washo, lower-case  represents a typical wye sound, while upper-case  represents a voiceless wye sound, a bit like the consonant in English hue.\n\nOther systems\nIn the International Phonetic Alphabet,  corresponds to the close front rounded vowel, and the related character  corresponds to the near-close near-front rounded vowel.\n\nOther uses\n\n In mathematics, y is commonly used as the name for a dependent variable. The modern tradition of using x, y and z to represent an unknown (incognita) was introduced by René Descartes in La Géométrie (1637).\n The SI prefix for 1024 is yotta, abbreviated by the letter Y.\n\nRelated characters\nthumb|Cyrillic У, Latin Y and Greek Υ and ϒ in FreeSerif – one of the few typefaces that distinguish between the Latin and the Greek form\nthumb|The Dutch digraph IJ is sometimes written like a Cyrillic У.\n\nDescendants and related characters in the Latin alphabet\nY with diacritics: Ý ý Ỳ ỳ Ŷ ŷ Ÿ ÿ Ỹ ỹ Ẏ ẏ Ỵ ỵ ẙ Ỷ ỷ Ȳ ȳ Ɏ ɏ Ƴ ƴ\n  and  are used in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\n IPA superscript letters: 𐞠 𐞲 𐞡\n 𝼆 : Small letter turned y with belt is an extension to IPA for disordered speech (extIPA)\n  is used in the Teuthonista phonetic transcription system\nʸ is used for phonetic transcription\nỾ ỿ : Y with loop is used by some Welsh medievalists to indicate the schwa sound of \n\nAncestors and siblings in other alphabets\n𐤅: Semitic letter Waw, from which the following symbols originally derive\nΥ υ : Greek letter Upsilon, from which Y derives\n : Coptic letter epsilon/he (not to be confused with the unrelated Greek letter Ε ε called epsilon)\n𐌖 : Old Italic U/V, which is the ancestor of modern Latin V and U\n : Gothic letter /, which is transliterated as w\nУ у : Cyrillic letter U, which derives from Greek upsilon via the digraph omicron-upsilon used to represent the sound /u/\nѴ ѵ : Cyrillic letter izhitsa, which derives from Greek upsilon and represents the sounds /i/ or /v/.

Theoretically there were some 250,000 armed men serving in various armed branches. However, in fact this figure was probably much closer to 170,000, of which 90,000 served in the military and 80,000 in public order formations; detailed figures advanced by historians differ.\n\nIn historiography the prevailing opinion is that more armed servicemen joined the rebels than the loyalists; the ratio advanced differs from 59:41 to 52:48, yet there are also scholars who claim that only the minority joined the insurgency. It is usually accepted that slightly more peninsular troops and slightly more public order men remained loyal rather than rebelled, but that the so-called Army of Africa, which in its entirety joined the coup, tilted the balance in favor of the Nationalists.\n\nNumerical split of manpower between the two warring sides of the Spanish Civil War is by no means indicative as to division of military and combat potential. This is mostly because in the Republican zone the effectives theoretically available were not taken advantage of; many military units were dissolved as potentially rebellious, many officers were detained, many units with few officers and NCOs left turned into loose undisciplined groupings, many rank-and-file servicemen opted for a wait-and-see stance and many later crossed to the Nationalist zone. Also, in early days following the failed coup the military potential of both sides was to a significant extent defined by civilian volunteers.\n\nMilitary\nthumb|left|president Azaña and military commanders, 1934\nThe Spanish military forces were falling into 3 major groups: 1) mainland army, stationed in garrisons in peninsular Spain and on the islands; in numerical terms it was composed mostly of conscripts. Most scholars do not hold these troops in high regard, suggesting poor quality of training, low morale, outdated equipment and officers who often have never seen combat, resembling bureaucrats in uniforms rather than military commanders. These troops were organised into 8 so-called organic divisions, each corresponding to one military region; their theoretical strength is quoted as 110,000-120,000, but in July 1936 there were no more than 70,000 actually in the barracks; 2) army stationed in Africa. It consisted of heterogeneous formations, but mostly of indigenous Moroccan troops and the Foreign Legion, both composed of volunteers. Most of its officers and NCOs saw combat during Rif Wars. African troops were widely considered the best part of the Spanish army; they numbered some 24,500 men in actual service; 3) the navy. In terms of manpower there were some 12,000 people serving in its ranks; the fleet was composed of rather obsolete larger warships and numerous newer destroyers, with some modern cruisers near completion in shipyards. Peninsular and African troops were governed by the Ministry of War; the fleet was governed by the Ministry of Marine. Air force, which technically formed a separate branch, in terms of manpower grouped no more than few thousand men. there were some 250 military pilots in service, Hugh Thomas, Historia de la guerra civil española, Barcelona 1977, ISBN 9788422608745, p. 360; the rest were mechanics, other ground specialists and contracted civilians \n\nPeninsular army\n\nQuesada claims that on paper, there were 120,000 men on the continent and islands in total; Alejandro de Quesada, The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939 (1).

Michael Alpert, The Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939, Cambridge 2013, ISBN 9781107028739, p. 19 How this mass was split between the Republicans and the Nationalists is unclear, e.g. at times totals advanced by various authors do not match their own sub-totals. Quesada claims that on paper there were 120,000 in the peninsular army, but 40,000 enjoyed leave, which leaves 80,000 in the barrackes. However, when doing detailed calculations for warring parties, he arrives at the peninsular total of only 47,000, compare Quesada 2014, p. 9, and Alejandro de Quesada, The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939 (2).

Payne, The Spanish Civil War, Cambridge 2012, ISBN 978052117470177, p. 77 (47,000 Republicans, 38,000 Nationalists?). Some scholars, who accept the figure of 66,000 troops actually in the barracks on the peninsula, settle for general remark that they were “spread roughly equally”.Judith Keene, Fighting for Franco, London 2007, ISBN 9780826425713, p. 27 In structural terms, out of 8 divisional commands 3 were controlled by the Republicans (I: Madrid, III: Valencia, IV: Barcelona) and 5 by the Nationalists (II: Sevilla, V: Zaragoza, VI: Burgos, VII: Valladolid, VIII: La Coruña).\n\nAfrican army\nthumb|left|Regulares during the July Coup\nSome earlier works, e.g. Salas, claimed that the Army of Africa consisted of some 47,000 troops; Molina, Sagarra, González 2021, p. 51 also some recent books advance similar figures, e.g. by Beevor“The nationalists’ greatest military asset was the 40,000 men of the Army of Africa, with its combat experience”, Beevor 2009, p. 126 and Casanova. Julian Casanova, The Spanish Civil War, Cambridge 2009, ISBN 9781350127586, p. 24 However, there was no homogeneous formation known as “Army of Africa” and Spanish Morocco was garrisoned by at least 4 different formations: 1) Foreign Legion, 2) indigenous troops in Spanish service, so-called Regulares, both infantry and cavalry, 3) indigenous troops in service of the sultan and 4) Carabineros, plus 5) minor figures related to navy, air force and policing formations. Already some older studies claimed that there were merely 24.5 thousand troops available to the Nationalists in Morocco, Payne 1970, p. 315 and the figure of 24,741 is advanced also by the recent military analysis. Molina, Sagarra, González 2021, p. 51 The difference, apart from usual issues related to leaves and outdated documentation, is due to some categories, especially troops in sultan’s service, formally not having been under Spanish command and not having been available for shift towards the peninsula. All sources agree, however, that troops brought to Spain from Morocco were the best units in the army, battle-hardened during the Rif Wars, well-equipped and with high combative spirit. Almost all of these 25 thousand men joined the Nationalists, with the exception of some 300 men on leave on the peninsula. Payne 1970, p. 315\n\nNavy\nthumb|Spanish navy crew (1931)\nThough in terms of land forces the potential of Spanish army was rather limited and in numerical terms it was smaller e.g. than the armies of Poland,in 1936 the Polish land forces were 278,851 men, Historia Polski w liczbach, Warszawa 2003, ISBN 8370273149, p. 308 Romaniathroughout most of the interwar period the Romanian army was almost 200,000 men, to grow to almost 300,000 in the very late 1930s, Istoria Militară a Poporului Român, Vol. VI, București 1989, pp. 227-228 and CzechoslovakiaCzechoslovak army was composed of 12 infantry divisions, some 150,000 men in total, its navy still ranked as a powerful force to be reckoned with. In Europe it ranked far behind the British and French fleets, but until the early 1930s it was still comparable to the Soviet navy (Europe), German Reichsmarine/Kriegsmarine and the Italian Regia Marina, outclassed only when the latter three embarked on massive investment program. Salas estimated total naval personnel at 20,000, Ramón Salas, Historia del Ejército Popular, Tomo I, Madrid 1974, pp. 260, 855 yet contemporary military historians reduce this figure to some 12,000 men. Molina, Sagarra, González 2021, p. 51 One source claims that 7,000 joined the rebels (with no info either on total or how many remained loyal),Quesada 2014, p. 34 the information difficult to reconcile with breakup of the vessels. This, however, is of limited importance; what mattered was the split of warships available. In terms of tonnage, the Republican fleet was double the size of the Nationalist one (some 60,000 tons vs. some 30,000 tons), which was mostly thanks to Nationalist control over 1 battleship (16,000 tons). In terms of the number of warships the Republican advantage was massive: they operated 1 battleship, 3 light cruisers, 14 destroyers and 12 submarines, while the Nationalists operated 1 battleship, 1 light cruiser, 1 destroyer and no submarine. The Republicans controlled all ports along the Bay of Biscay and on the Mediterranean (some 80% of all coastline), while the Nationalists controlled ports in Galicia and on the Atlantic coast of Andalusia.compare initial chapers of Michael Alpert, La guerra civil española en el mar, Madrid 1987, ISBN 8432306096\n\nTotal military\n\nAlmost no author provides overall military figures (peninsula + Africa + navy) and in most cases, their suggestions must be ascertained by means of adding sub-totals or applying partial ratio calculations. For Romero Salvado it is 35,000 Republicans vs. 66,000 Nationalists (35:65), Romero Salvado, pp. 55-56 for Beevor it is 57,000 Republicans vs. 100,000 Nationalists (36:64), Beevor 2009, p. 126 for Quesada it is 33,000 Republicans vs. 53,000 Nationalists (38:62), Quesada 2015, p. 11, Quesada, 2014, pp. 9, 15 and for Turnbull it is 33,000 Republicans vs. 48,000 Nationalists (41:59). Turnbull 1995, pp. 5-7 The narrative by Payne implicitly suggests the same ratio, but somewhat higher figures, namely 47,000 Republicans vs. 68,000 Nationalists (41:59). Payne 2012, p. 77 The officer corps got split fairly evenly; recent military estimates suggest that out of 17,000 officers in total (inc. retired etc), 8,000 found themselves in the Republican zone and 9,000 in the Nationalist one (47:53). However, in fact only 4,000 supported the loyalists and 13,000 opted for the rebels. Molina, Sagarra, González 2021, p. 55 Another author claims that out of officers active and in service, 2,000 opted for the Republicans Quesada 2015, p. 11 and more than 4,600 for the Nationalists. Quesada 2014, p. 9 For NCOs the numbers were 7,500 in the Republican zone and 8,000 in the Nationalist one.\n\nPublic order forces\n\nApart from regular military, there were 3 other major uniformed and armed formations. None of them was formatted as combat troops, intended to take part in tactical warfare operations. However, they consisted of disciplined men in structured, barracks-based units, trained to perform policing role and to use firearms. The traditional constabulary, operational mostly in rural areas, was Guardia Civil (some 34,000 men). Another traditional service was Carabineros (formally Instituto de Carabineros), operating mostly along the frontiers to prevent smuggling (sources provide figures ranging from 14,000 to 16,000). Relatively new service was Guardia de Asalto (formally Cuerpo de Seguridad y Asalto), set up by the Republic (some 18,000). The Civiles and the Asaltos were subordinated to the Ministry of Interior; the Carabineros formed part of the Ministry of Finance structures. There was no service named “police”. However, there were some specialized armed services, e.g. traffic rules were enforced by Cuerpo de Vigilantes de Caminos. Jacinto Contreras Vázquez, La agrupación de tráfico de la Guardia Civil, [in:] VIII Congreso virtual sobre Historia de las Vías de Comunicación, s.l. 2020, pp. 75 There were also various armed policing services subordinated to local authorities, be it regional or province-specific. Strength of these other units is highly unclear, though they might have amounted to 14,000. detailed report of Nationalist general staff of 1937 evaluated the balance of forces in July 1936; the table contained a position “Guardia de Asalto y policía armada” (31,200 men). Since Guardia de Asalto numbered 17,600 men, this leaves some 13,600 to all other minor formations, data referred aftyer Payne 1970, p. 315 Total number of servicemen in all security formations was about 80,000.\n\nGuardia Civil\nthumb|left|Civiles in action (1934)\nBy far the largest security formation in Spain was Guardia Civil; in sources its strength is quoted as 32,458, Gerard Blaney Jr, The Civil Guard and the Spanish Second Republic, 1931-1936 [PhD thesis LSE], London 2007, p. 155 32,477, Molina, Sagarra, González 2021, p. 51 32,860, Alpert 2013, p. 19 or 34,320. Payne 1970, p. 315 Its units were scattered evenly across all of the country, though with higher saturation in rural areas and small towns rather than in large urban centres. Its commander, general Sebastián Pozas Perea, was a loyal though not particularly vocal republican. The Civiles had a long-standing reputation of heavy-handed service, and were despised by left-wing supporters as an instrument of reactionary politics. Some sources claim that most of the servicemen joined the rebels; Beevor maintains that merely 40% (which would translate to 13,000-14,000 men) remained loyal. Beevor 2009, p. 126 However, academic scholars tend to disagree; according to Tusell some 51% sided with the government, Javier Tusell, Historia de España el el siglo XX, vol. 2, Madrid 2007, ISBN 9788430606306, p. 300 the popular Osprey series by Quesada suggested rather 53% Quesada 2014 , p. 36 while earlier Osprey work by Turnbull suggested 59%; Turnbull 1995, p. 5 also the Nationalist staff quoted by Payne estimated the ratio of 59% (20,100). Payne 1970, p. 315, Turnbull 1995, p. 5 Depending upon the ratio estimated and overall strength assumed, in absolute terms these percentages would translate to some 16,000-20,000 Civiles in the Republican ranks and 13,000-16,000 in the Nationalist ones. There is abundant evidence of Guardia Civil taking part in combat during the July coup, either on the rebel or on the loyalist side. There seems to be no particular pattern emerging, and even in one area local garrisons might have adopted a different stand, e.g. in the Seville province some rebelled (in Ecija),Francisco Javier Gavira Gil, Verano de 1936. La toma de Marchena, triunfo del golpe de estado y su terrorifíca implantación represora, [in:] Actas de las IX Jornadas sobre Historia de Marchena: Marchena en el siglo XX, Marchena 2005, ISBN 9788493407025, p. 101 some suppressed the rebellion (in Carmona)Antonio Lería, Golpe de estado y guerra civil en Carmona, [in:] La Guerra Civil en Carmona, Carmona 2008, p. 11 and some assumed a wait-and-see position (Osuna).Felix J. Montero Gómez, Osuna, 20 de julio 1936: consecuencias de la rebelión militar, Osuna 2012, p. 19\n\nGuardia de Asalto\nthumb|Asaltos during the July Coup\nSources tend to agree that the Asaltos numbered some 17.5 thousand servicemen (with detailed figure of 17,660 quoted). Alpert 2013, p. 19, Molina, Sagarra, González 2021, p. 50 Since the formation was set up during the early Republic days – at the time it numbered some 4,000 men Alejandro Vargas González, La guardia de asalto, policía de la república, [in:] Cuadernos republicanos 53 (2003), p. 45 - it was intended not only as urban police, but also as sort of republican guard, which translated into specific recruitment and vetting procedures. It was partially formatted as riot police, supposed to deal also with urban unrest; the Asaltos were even equipped with armoured vehicles. They were deployed mostly in major urban centres; 6,000 (34% of the total) served in Madrid and Barcelona. All authors agree that Guardia de Asalto remained mostly loyal to the government, either because of republican preferences of its servicemen, or because in large cities the rebels remained hesitant, which prompted these vacillating to side with the prevailing party. Tusell, Tusell 2007, p. 300 Payne and other sources Vargas González 2003, p. 45 agree that some 70% of the Asaltos sided with the loyalists, Payne 1970, p. 315 which in absolute figures would translate to some 12,000 in Republican ranks and some 5,000 in the Nationalist ones. Also Quesada claims 12,000 for the Republicans. Quesada 2015, p. 11 Beevor claims that as much as 40% sided with the rebels,“They had about two-thirds of Queipo’s carabineros, 40 per cent of the Assault Guard and 60 per cent of the Civil Guard”, Beevor 2009, p. 126 which would rather suggest the figures of 11,000 for the Republicans and 7,000 for the Nationalists.\n\nCarabineros\nthumb|left|Carabineros in action (1935)\nIn literature there is some discrepancy as to the number of Carabineros: some authors claim 14,113 Alpert 2013, p. 20 and others claim 16,096. Molina, Sagarra, González 2021, p. 50 Like in case of Guardia de Asalto, their geographical distribution was highly uneven, this time conditioned not by urbanisation, but by location of Spanish frontiers; they were deployed mostly along the coastline, in northern provinces along the Pyrenean border with France and in western provinces along the border with Portugal. The general inspector of the formation was Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, one of chief military conspirators and later rebel leaders, yet there is no evidence he developed a plot structured in ranks of the service. It rather seems that their choices were conditioned by circumstances; in regions where rebels prevailed (Navarre, Leon) see e.g. Gabriel Jackson, Memorias de Angel Espíás Bermudez, [in:] Ebre 2 (2004), pp. 61-84 they sided with the Nationalists, in regions with loyalist domination (Catalonia, Extremadura) they supported the government. Payne, Turnbull and Tusell agree that in overall terms most of the Carabineros remained in Republican ranks, though they give the percentage as 65% Tusell 2007, p. 300 (some 10,000 men, the figure also explicitly advanced by Quesada Quesada 2015, p. 11), 60% Payne 1970, p. 315 (some 9,000 men) or 59% (also 9,000), Turnbull 1995, p. 5 which leaves some 4,000-5,000 for the Nationalists. Entirely different split is suggested by Beevor, who maintains that “about two-thirds” opted for rebellion (hence, some 5,000 for the Republicans and some 10,000 for the Nationalists). Beevor 2009, p. 126\n\nOther armed policing services\n\nAlmost all historiographic works ignore minor, local and specialized armed services, and almost none provides any approximation as to their numerical strength.the exception is Quesada 2015, p. 36, who includes a separate sub-chapter on Mossos d'Esquadra. He claims that during the war the Mossos grew from 300 to 1,000 men However, when in 1937 the Nationalist general staff estimated composition of both sides back in July 1936, they included the position of “Guardia de Asalto y policía armada”, with the total of 31,200 men. Payne 1970, p. 315 As the number of the Asaltos was 17.6 thousand, this leaves some 13,600 to all other minor specialized formations, like Cuerpo de Vigilantes de Caminos, forest rangers, or prison guards; this figure covers also local policing services, be it regional (Mossos d’Esquadra in Catalonia), e.g. the Catalan Mossos d’Esquadra, see Mossos d’Esquadra entry, [in:] official Catalan government service provincial (Miqueletes in Gipuzkoa or Miñones in Alava) or municipal (in some cities municipal guards carried firearms). It is not clear how many of them sided with the loyalists and how many joined the rebels. If the Nationalist estimates are considered as point of departure and if the number of Asaltos is accepted as discussed earlier, it seems that some 10,000 remained loyal and some 4,000 opted for insurgency. There is little anecdotic evidence available to provide some examples, yet it is known that some of these servicemen initially took part in combat; e.g. Mossos d'Esquadra protected governmental buildings in BarcelonaVanessa Gómez Hernández, Els mossos d’esquadra durant la segona república (1931-1939), [in:] Judit Vidal Bonavila, Jaume Camps Girona, José Luis Trapero Álvarez (eds), Els Mossos d'Esquadra, història i evolució d'una institució tricentenària, Barcelona 2022, ISBN 9788484249276, pp. 222-223 and Miqueletes engaged against advancing Carlist requetés in defence of their control posts at the border between Gipuzkoa and Navarre. Francisco Javier de Lizarza India, [in:] Fundación Ignacio Larramendi service\n\nTotal security formations\nthumb|left|Carabineros with smuggled goods\nAll security formations in total are usually estimated to be between some 65,000 Alpert 2013, p. 20 and 70,000 men, Quesada 2015, p. 11, Quesada, 2014, p. 9 though these computations do not include local and specialized policing services; when included, the figure might be around 80,000. Payne 1970, p. 315 Totals for both warring factions, which emerge from aggregating specific estimates coming from various authors and related to particular services might differ widely, ranging between 39,000 to 52,000 for the Republicans and between 27,000 and 41,000 for the Nationalists. However, in few cases some authors provide their suggestions for all security services in total, not necessarily in line with their detailed estimates. Beevor claims there were 33,000 for the Republicans“in addition to some 33,000 men from the paramilitary security forces”, Beevor 2009, p. 126 and 30,000 for the Nationalists;“In all, this represented about 30,000 men out of the combined strength of the three paramilitary forces”, Beevor 2009, p. 126 Payne suggests rather 37,000 vs. 30,000,„more than half of the security forces” [of 67,000], Payne 2012, p. 77 Quesada maintains 40,000 vs. 30,000, not explicitly; these are totals which emerge from adding up sub-totals he quoted, see Quesada 2015, p. p. 11, Quesada, 2014, p. 9 Turnbull 32,000 vs. 21,000, Turnbull 1995, p. 5 and the Nationalist general staff estimated in 1937 that the figures were 51,000 vs. 29,000. Payne 1970, p. 315 The overall percentage split of security forces which emerges from different sources is (Republicans vs. Nationalists): 64:36 (Nationalist staff, 1937), 61:39 (Turnbull), 60:40 (Tusell), 57:43 (Quesada), 55:45 (Payne) and 52:48 (Beevor).\n\nArmed forces in total\nthumb|army officer, Guardia Civil commander and prime minister during a local ceremony, 1935\nIn theory in July 1936 there were some 250,000 men in all Spanish armed forces, both the military and the security formations. On paper, i.e. counting theoretical staff figures related to specific garrisons, some 110,000 were in the Republican zone and 140,000 in the Nationalist one (44:56). Molina, Sagarra, González 2021, p. 49 Beevor maintains that proportionate advantage of the rebels was even larger and gives the totals of 90,000 in Republican zone and 130,000 in the Nationalist one (41:59). Beevor 2009, p. 126 However, some synthetic works might claim the reverse proportion, e.g. according to Casanova out of 250,000 in total, 120,000 opted for the rebels (which implies that 130,000 remained loyal, 52:48). Casanova 2009, p. 24 The discrepancy is of little importance, since 250,000 was a largely theoretical figure and the actual number of men under arms was much lower, mostly due to outdated staff documentation, recruitment in progress, and leaves in midst of the summer season.\n\nRecent study of military historians claims that the figure of “los efectivos realmente operativos” was probably about 167,000, Molina, Sagarra, González 2021, p. 51 though earlier figures provided by some authors added up even to the record low total of 133,000. Turnbull 1995, pp. 5, 7 The Nationalist general staff estimated in 1937 that with the total of 165,000, the split was 88,000 for the loyalists and 77,000 for the rebels (53:47),“Perhaps 33,000 men of the pre-war Army remained loyal, together with about 18,000 of the Guardia Civil rural gendarmerie, 12,000 of the urban Cuerpo de Seguridad y Asalto, and 10,000 Carabineros border guards. In July 1936 about 2,000 loyalist officers remained at their posts; perhaps 1,500 recently retired officers also returned to the colours”, Quesada 2015, p. 11 which is the unique (along Casanova) statistics claiming the Republicans held numerical advantage. Various sub-totals calculated by Quesada point to the similar total of 158,000, but with exactly the opposite split: 74,000 for the Republicans Quesada 2015, p. 11 and 84,000 for the Nationalists (47:53). Quesada 2015, p. 9 One eminent historian also claims Nationalist numerical advantage; he opts for the total of 184,000 and for the split of 88,000 vs. 96,000 (48:52).“it would probably be accurate to raise the figure for the latter [i.e. the Nationalists] by 25 percent”, Payne 1970, p. 315 In his later work he is somewhat more vague, but with the similar total of 182,000 and the similar – though implied, not explicitly stated – split of 84,000 Republicans and 98,000 Nationalists (46:54). the paragraph in question is typical for many historiographic accounts, based on cautious vague statements with few detailed figures. The author claims that the peninsular army was “fewer than 90,000 men under arms in the barracks” (85,000?). “Less than half of these” (45%?) joined the revolt. Forces of public order were “approximately 67,000”, of which “more than half” (55?) remained loyal. The strength of the Army of Africa is stated as 30,000, Payne 2012, p. 77. The calculation which emerges for the Nationalists is 85,000x0.45 + 67,000x0.45 + 30,000 = 98,400 The smallest overall difference in strength is suggested by Turnbull: 65,000 Republicans and 68,000 Nationalists (49:51). Turnbull 1995, pp. 5, 7\n\nTabular summary\n\nThe below table summarises all numerical estimates found in the sources consulted and discussed above. The numbers are in thousands. In most cases there are 2 figures in a cell; one is for the lowest figure identified, and one is for the highest figure identified. Given the discrepancies, it is hardly possible to suggest a \"prevailing\" figure for every category. Also, an attempt to produce an arithmetic \"average\" figure does not seem feasible, given one single extreme estimate might distort the calculation; e.g. five sourcesAlpert 2013, Cierva 1969, Romero 2013, Turnbull 1995, Quesada 2014/2015 give the number of peninsular troops loyal to the government in the range of 32,000-36,000, but there is another oneBeevor 2009 which comes out with the figure of 57,000.  \n\n formation total  Republicans Nationalists  peninsular army  55-105  32-57  19-50  African army  25-45  0  25-45  navy  12-20  10-15  2-7  Guardia Civil  32-34  14-20  13-16  Guardia de Asalto  17  10-12  5-7  Carabineros  14-16  5-10  5-10  other policing services 0-14  0-10  0-4  TOTAL  133-250  65-110  68-140\n\nSee also\n\n Army of Africa (Spain)\n Civil Guard (Spain)\n Cuerpo de Seguridad y Asalto\n Carabineros (Spain)\n Golpe de Estado de julio de 1936 en la Armada española\n Spanish coup of July 1936\n\nFootnotes\n\nFurther reading\n\n Michael Alpert, The Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939, Cambridge 2013, ISBN 9781107028739\n Alexander Clifford, The People's Army in the Spanish Civil War.

Fotos Tzavelas was the first-born son of Lambros and Moscho Tzavela. He succeeded his father in the leadership of the Souliotes, after the battle of Ḱafa and the defeat of Ali Pasha in which Pasha was forced to exchange the hostages that held since 1792 with important Arvanites who had been captured by the Souliotes. Thus he freed Fotos who returned to Souli, and, after his father's death, the Souliotes elected him their leaderΣτασινόπουλος, σελ 310. Despite the capitulation, Ali Pasha launched new attacks (1800 - 1803) against the Souliots. The battles of the Arvanitas of Ali against the Souliots did not bring any results, in the summer of 1800. That is why Pasha decided and built towers in the area around Souli, and besieged the Souliots with his askeri.Στασινόπουλος, σελ 315 Fotos Tzavelas distinguished himself in these battles for his heroism and the spirit of the leader Πάπυρος Λαρούς Μπριτάνικα, τόμος 57, λήμμα Τζαβέλας (Φώτος), σελ. 147 - 148  \"Ιστορία του Σουλίου και Πάργας\", Χ.

As the commander of the 2nd battalion of the 502nd famous mountain brigade of the Fifth Corps, he died on November 28, 1992, in the Grabež region while performing a combat mission. He was posthumously awarded the Golden Lily and the Order of the Hero of the Liberation War of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n Early life \nHe was born in Banja Luka on April 5, 1964. He was named after his mother, Adila, who died 8 days after his birth. He grew up in a family originating from the Prijedor neighborhood of Kozarac, which consisted of his father Adem, stepmother Bahri, and brothers: the elder Nihad and two younger brothers Ilijaz and Izet.\n\nSoon after his birth, in 1964, the Bešić family moved from Kozarac to Prijedor, where Adil finished elementary school. In 1978, as an excellent student, he went to Zagreb, where he entered the Military High School, after which he continued his education at the Military Academy, majoring in the Army. He attended the first two years of the military academy in Sarajevo, and the remaining two years of study in Belgrade, where he graduated.\n\n Military career \nAfter graduating from the Military Academy, he continued his career in the JNA, as an officer. His office was originally located in Tolmin, Slovenia. Over time, he proves himself a promising officer. He completes a course for JNA reconnaissance units, after which he works as an intelligence agent in the border area, on the state triple border, between the former Yugoslavia, Austria, and Italy.\n\nWith the declaration of Slovenia's independence and the beginning of the Ten-Day War, the JNA unit he served was located on the Yugoslav border, in Nova Gorica. After the JNA withdrew from the territory of Slovenia, the JNA unit in which Adil Bešić was on August 29, 1991, together with about 100 vehicles was stationed in Bihać. Part of that unit, in which Adil was also, was transferred to Plitvice, over which JNA forces took control on March 31, 1991.\n\nAfter the start of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, he left the JNA. He then joined the Territorial Defense of RBiH in Bihać, where he took command of the Territorial Defense Detachment \"Gata-Vrsta\".\n\n War period \nAfter taking command of the TO \"Gata-Vrsta\" Detachment, Adil Bešić, as a professional military person, established a military organization and, through his activities in the Detachment, asked his subordinates to professionally perform the tasks entrusted to them while strictly punishing all illegal actions and respecting the Geneva Conventions.\n\nThe first significant event under the command of Adil Bešić took place on June 12, 1992, when, in an organized action, the TO \"Vrsta\" units liberated the populated place of Bulgar and went to the state border with Croatia.\n\nIn the next period, the Detachment preserved the defense lines and reached the Serbian Plateau and other defense lines around Bihać.\n\nWith the formation of the 2nd Bihać Brigade (502nd Knight's Mountain Brigade), Adil Bešić became the commander of its 2nd battalion.\n\n Death \nIn November 1992, the forces led by Bešić liberated Lohovska Brda. After the successes achieved in the Grabež region, he was killed on November 28, 1992, as the commander of the 2nd Battalion of the then 2nd Bihać Brigade, while performing a combat mission.\n\n Legacy \nThe barracks in Bihać used as HQ of the 5th Corps were named after him after his death (), and they still exist today under that name, used by the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n References \n\nCategory:1992 deaths\nCategory:1964 births\nCategory:Officers of the Yugoslav People's Army\nCategory:People from Prijedor\nCategory:Recipients of the Order of the Hero of the Liberation War\nCategory:Recipients of the Order of the Golden Lily",

While first discovered by NASA's Voyager 1 mission, the scientific community has gained further understanding through the following Voyager 2 and Cassini missions in conjunction with ground-based observation and data gathering methods.\n\n Voyager \nSaturn Electrostatic discharges were first recorded by the Voyager 1 mission as it passed near Saturn in November 1980. The term was subsequently coined by Warwick et al. in April 1981 in the Journal Planetary Radio Astronomy Observations from Voyager 1 Near Saturn. It was initially uncertain whether these SEDs were associated with storms in the planet's atmosphere or if they were originating in its rings. Evans et al. hypothesized that they originated from a satellite located within Saturn's B Ring, which was also the proposed reason for a narrow feature also found. This was disputed in 1983 by Kaiser et al., who argued that the occultation caused by the planet lasted too long for SEDs to originate in the rings.\n\n Cassini \nWhen the Cassini mission reached Saturn in 2004, SEDs and optical storm observations were finally directly linked. This occurred when Cassini ISS imaged the Dragon Storm, which was located by the SEDs it produced and then optically verified. It and other white storm clouds were found to be brighter in conjunction with higher rates of SEDs. The Dragon Storm can range over 2,000 miles and is located at a planetocentric latitude of 35° south. This planet region is called \"storm alley\" as all storm activity on Saturn was concentrated here in a 1.5° band from 2002 to 2010.\n\nDuring the Cassini mission, it was also discovered that SEDs could be detected over the horizon. This phenomenon, known as over-the-horizon events, was made possible by the previously mentioned combination of radio and optical observations. It is theorized that this occurs when SED radio waves are temporarily trapped under Saturn's ionosphere.\n\n Ground Based Observations \nThe first reliable ground-based detections of SEDs occurred in Ukraine in January/February 2006. At this time, SED storm E lasted approximately one month. The ground team used the UTR-2 radio telescope, and the data was combined with real-time information from Cassini. These efforts were made easier by the high intensity of the SEDs occurring during the month-long SED storm E. The process was repeated in November 2007 during the eight-month-long storm F and produced a high degree of coincidence between the UTR-2 and Cassini.\n\nAt this same time as storm E, amateur astronomers became engaged in observing Saturn's storms. Storm E, observed by Cassini, was the first long-lasting SED storm while Saturn was distant from solar conjunction, making it high in the sky for ground-based observers. In the images captured by amateurs, the SED storms proved easily detectable, manifesting as bright white spots.\n\n References \n\nCategory:Planetary atmospheres of the Solar System\nCategory:Saturn",

        "content": "The Sherwin-Williams Headquarters is a 36-story office building in Cleveland, Ohio. At , it is the 4th tallest building in Cleveland, and the 6th tallest building in Ohio. As the name implies, it is the global headquarters of Sherwin-Williams, the largest paint and coating company in the world. The headquarters complex consists of three city blocks, including the primary tower, a parking garage, and a pavilion, with hints of possible future expansion within the remainder of the lots.\n\n History \nSherwin-Williams was founded in Cleveland, Ohio in 1866. Since 1930, the company has been headquartered in the Midland Building, which is part of the larger Landmark Office Towers Complex. In 2019, the company announced that it was seeking to move into a larger office building, potentially leaving Cleveland altogether, although they confirmed they would be staying in Cleveland in February 2020. In March 2020, the company paid $49.4 million for the 7 acre plot of land for the building, which was previously a 1,100 space parking lot.\n\nIn late 2022, the final design of the building was submitted to the city. Construction of the building began in 2022, with site preparation and foundation construction, both of which were completed in 2023. In 2023, the structural steel construction began and finished, as well as the building enclosure and interior finishes, with the enclosure having finished in 2024. Interior finishing are expected to continue until early 2025. In 2024, the final details and landscaping for the building are also expected to continue into 2025. Occupancy by employees is expected in late 2024.\n\nThe possibility of an HQ2 has been mentioned since the design phase of the building in 2021, which would be a building adjacent to the current tower within the same lot, as job growth within the company will put the new headquarters at full capacity as soon as it is completed, at the intended 3,500 employees. Surface parking lots were intentionally left in the plans of the headquarters for future development of a Phase Two.\n\n Design \nThe headquarters contains about 1 million square footage, and contains three buildings, including the primary 36-story tower, a two-story pavilion, and a 5 story parking garage. The main tower is facing W 3rd Street, while the parking garage is located on the other side of Frankfort Avenue connected via a skybridge, while there is a skybridge connecting the tower to the pavilion on the other side of the W 3rd Street. The two empty surface parking lots that remained in the plans for a potential Phase Two are within the same lots as the tower and the parking garage.\n\nThe design of the tower is largely glass, with the Sherwin-Williams name being located near the top of the building on both the east and west sides. There is a large vertical LED light running down the center of the building that shines white typically, as well as various thin vertical stripes along the top the part of the building, although in the designs they have shown special event lighting concepts such as red and blue for the Sherwin-Williams logo, pink for Breast Cancer Awareness, red, white, and blue for Veteran's Day, or a rainbow for Pride. The first three floors of the building consists of the lobby and other non-office amenities. Floors 5-13 are to contain office space, and floor 14 is to contain conference rooms and terraces. The parking garage of the building contains space for a retailer, and the wall facing Frankfort Avenue is to contain anthology wall, as well as public art facing other streets. Frankfort Avenue, the street between the tower and the garage, is to be repaved with a herringbone pattern consisting of three colors, with the addition of a bike lane and bike racks.\n\nThe pavilion of the tower, located across the street, takes up an entire city block, although the two story pavilion building only takes up part of the lot, with the rest of the lot acting as a public plaza with lots of green landscaping. The pavilion building is to contain large glass windows visible from every side, and contains a lobby. The plaza of the pavilion contains a purple-pink color garden, a rainbow walkway alongside the pavilion building and main tower, and various trees, with dozens of species of flowers and trees within the plaza and around the headquarters complex as a whole. The lawn in the plaza is to contain a large sign saying Sherwin-Williams Global Headquarters. Additionally, various colorful directional signs for both pedestrians and vehicles will be placed around the campus.\n\n See Also \n\n List of tallest buildings in Cleveland\n List of tallest buildings in Ohio\n List of largest office buildings\n\n References \n\nCategory:Skyscraper office buildings in Cleveland\nCategory:Downtown Cleveland\nCategory:Skyscrapers in Cleveland\nCategory:Lists of buildings and structures in Ohio\nCategory:2024 establishments in Ohio",

In addition to her therapeutic practice, she studies the Bible and Greek mythology with groups of scholars using psychoanalytic theory and, in return, questioning its foundations.\n\n Academic career \nMary Balmary is a clinical psychologist with university training, a psychoanalyst with Lacanian training and a researcher..\n\nHer doctoral thesis devoted to the relationship between Freudian theory and Freud 's family history having been refused before defense; she published it in 1979 under the title L'Homme aux statues: Freud et la faute cachée du père, or The Man with Statues: Freud and the hidden fault of the father . In this work, she revisits Freudian theory based on a reading of the myth of Oedipus, which includes the story of Oedipus' father and the etymological consideration of the words and names of these stories and a study of their relationship with the history of Freud's family..\n\nAfter the publication of her thesis, Balmary began reading the Bible. When she approached the Biblical origin myth, which she considered to be the book of Genesis, she followed the Biblical reading seminar of the Jesuit exegete Paul Beauchamp . for three years in the early 1980s, and became close from him.\n\nIn her reading, she mobilized psychoanalytic concepts to understand and interpret the founding biblical texts.. She paids very close attention to the letter of these texts, in their original languages, Hebrew, Aramaic and biblical Greek, which she learned, and considered any apparent strangeness or \"mistakes\" of the text, including grammatical errors, as being able to carry meaning.\n\nHer close reading led to new understandings and re-interpretations.\n\nExamples :\n\n In The Forbidden Sacrifice, she notes that it is Abraham who attributes to God an order (that of sacrificing his son Isaac), though is not explicitly written that he gave it;\n in The Divine Origin, she proposes that the prohibition of the Garden of Eden relates to the confusing of the masculine and the feminine, of man and woman not understanding the other well, and of assimilating it to oneself instead of accepting it as it is. 'he is.\n She also disputes the translation of a sentence ( « You will give birth in pain » ) that God addresses to Eve . A more appropriate translation would be « In sorrow you will give birth to sons \", which would thus refer to « the difficulty for human beings to let their own life, their own words happen in others and particularly the child ».\n\n Publications \n\n Works \n\n 1979 : , Le Livre de Poche Biblio Essais n° 4201 – 1994.\n 1986 : , Le Livre de Poche Biblio Essais n° 4220 – 07/11/1995 - ( Nicolas Missarel Prize in 1987),...\n 1993 : The divine origin.

        "content": "200px|thumb|German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who coined the term\n\nReichsfeinde (lit. \"enemies of the Reich) was a pejorative term used for groups which were in political opposition to the system of the German Reich during the tenure of Otto von Bismarck as chancellor of Germany and during the Nazi regime. Under Bismarck, the term was mainly employed against Catholics and Social Democrats to justify their political suppression. The Nazis added the Jewish people to this list of enemies and violently pursued their destruction for being \"non-German\".\n\n Imperial Germany \nThe German Empire was founded in 1871 after the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, with France, as a result, being perceived as the main foreign enemy of the new Reich. The external enemy of FranceSzilvia Odenwald-Varga: ‚Volk‘ bei Otto von Bismarck. Eine historisch-semantische Analyse anhand von Bedeutungen, Konzepten und Topoi. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York 2009, ISBN 978-3-11-021241-9, S. 117. was contrasted with the internal Reichsfeinde: Any societal or political forces that did not want to conform to the Protestant nation-state. Besides Catholics and the Labour movement, this also included national minorities such as the Danes, the Poles, the Alsace-Lorrainians (who voted for minority protest parties until 1890 in Reichstag elections), and adherents of the Guelph Party, who opposed the 1867 Prussian annexation of Hanover. Quickly, this was also extended to the German Jews. All of these groups were stigmatised as \"un-German\", they were accused of being unreliable and of undermining (and thereby weakening) national unity.Eckart Conze: Schatten des Kaiserreichs. Die Reichsgründung von 1871 und ihr schwieriges Erbe. dtv, München 2020, ISBN 978-3-423-28256-7, S. 139. A large part of the population of the empire was thus pushed out of imperial affairs;Szilvia Odenwald-Varga: ‚Volk‘ bei Otto von Bismarck. Eine historisch-semantische Analyse anhand von Bedeutungen, Konzepten und Topoi. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York 2009, S. 116. in the 1881 German federal election, the parties marked as Reichsfeinde by Bismarck achieved, according to American historian Otto Pflanze, a two-thirds majority.Otto Pflanze: Bismarck. Der Reichskanzler. C.H. Beck, München 1998, ISBN 3-406-42726-X, S. 314.\n\nCentral targets of Bismarck's persecution constituted political Catholicism and the Centre Party on one side, and the Labour movement on the other, with the latter unifying in 1875 through the merger of the General German Workers' Association (ADAV) and the Marxist Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP), forming the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (SAP). The Catholic population of the empire was accused of not being primarily loyal the newly-founded state, but rather to the pope. The Social Democrats were accused of being internationalists, since Karl Marx wrote in the Communist Manifesto in 1848: \"The working men have no fatherland.\" They were thusly called \"vaterlandslose Gesellen\", meaning \"fellows without a fatherland\".Walter Mühlhausen: Gegen den Reichsfeind – Anmerkungen zur Politik von Staat und Gesellschaft gegenüber der Sozialdemokratie im Kaiserreich. In: Ulrich Lappenküper (Hrsg.): Otto von Bismarck und das „lange 19. Jahrhundert“. Lebendige Vergangenheit im Spiegel der „Friedrichsruher Beiträge“ 1996–2016. Schöningh, Paderborn 2016, ISBN 978-3-506-78697-5, S. 329–352, hier S. 332. The leading Social Democrats August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht were sentenced to two years custodia honesta (Festungshaft) for opposing the German annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, which was viewed as high treason, in 1872.Michael Epkenhans: Die Reichsgründung 1870/71. C.H. Beck, München 2020, ISBN 978-3-406-75032-8, S. 88–91. Bismarck declared in a speech in the Prussian House of Lords on 24 April 1873, that the state was \"threatened in its very foundation\" and thus \"forced to self-defence\", as two parties were \"undertaking their activities against national development in an international manner\":\n\n Kulturkampf \nThe first \"internal battlefield\"Hans-Ulrich Wehler: Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte, Bd. 3: Von der „Deutschen Doppelrevolution“ bis zum Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges 1849–1914. C.H. Beck, München 1995, ISBN 3-406-32263-8, S. 902. of this conflict was the Kulturkampf. It constituted a confrontation between the Catholic Church and the secular state, which was observable in several European countries in the 19th century. The church claimed a monopoly on truth in its battle against rationalisation, secularisation and other aspects of modernisation: The First Vatican Council in 1870 had declared the doctrine of Papal infallibility, according to which the pope, as long as he spoke ex cathedra, was infallible. Liberals strongly protested this declaration. Bismarck was particularly worried that Catholic priests would support the Polish national movement in the Prussian provinces of Posen and West Prussia. The Prussian and later the Reich governments passed a series of laws and decrees, starting in 1872, which placed schools under state supervision and introduced civil marriage. Furthermore, political messages by priests \"from the pulpit\" were forbidden (Kanzelparagraf), evictions of priests from the country were made possible, and the Jesuit Order was banned.Ernst Engelberg: Bismarck. Das Reich in der Mitte Europas. Siedler, Berlin 1990, ISBN 3-88680-385-6, S. 119–146; Bastian Scholz: Die Kirchen und der deutsche Nationalstaat. Konfessionelle Beiträge zum Systembestand und Systemwechsel. Springer VS, Wiesbaden 2016, ISBN 978-3-658-11508-1, S. 183–190.\n\nThe Kulturkampf started in the summer of 1871 with a media campaign initated by Bismarck in different newspapers, starting with the Kreuzzeitung. A Catholic priest complained that Catholics had to read daily about being \"an enemy of the fatherland, a Roman [Römling, pejorative] and an idiot, and that his clergy was the scum of humanity.\"Jonathan Steinberg: Bismarck. Magier der Macht. Ullstein, Berlin 2015, ISBN 978-3-548-37584-7, S. 440. Bismarck first accused the Catholics of being Reichsfeinde on 30 January 1872 in a debate in the Prussian House of Representatives about the introduction of state supervision over the schooling system: Here, he first attacked the Centre Party directly. He accused the party of \"mobilising against the state\", since it also took in Protestants that \"had nothing in common with the party, except being hostile to the German Empire and Prussia\". The party had \"found acceptance and respect from all parties, be they national or revolutionary, that were hostile to the state.\" The Centre Party newspaper Germania expressed solidarity with the clerical newspapers of Southern Germany, which Bismarck denounced as \"the anti-German French press\", as \"the old press of the Confederation of the Rhine in Catholic clothing\".Zitiert bei Ernst Engelberg: Bismarck. Das Reich in der Mitte Europas. Siedler, Berlin 1990, S. 128 f. The Liberal press agreed on many of these statements and joined in denouncing the Catholic press.Armin Meinen: Umstrittene Moderne. Die Liberalen und der preußisch-deutsche Kulturkampf. In: Geschichte und Gesellschaft 29, Heft 1 (2003), S. 138–156. The weekly newspaper Das Neue Reich applauded the banning of the Jesuits in 1875: According to them, it was \"high time to intervene against these parasites, just as one would against Grape phylloxera, Colorado beetles and other Reichsfeinde.\"Zitiert bei David Blackbourn: Das Kaiserreich transnational. Eine Skizze. In: Sebastian Conrad, Jürgen Osterhammel (Hrsg.): Das Kaiserreich transnational. Deutschland in der Welt 1871–1914. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, Göttingen 2004, S. 302–324, hier S. 316.\n\nIn the mid-1870s, all Catholic bishops in Germany were either in exile or under arrest, but the power of political Catholicism remained unbroken: In the 1874 German federal election, the Centre Party doubled its votes relative to the 1871 German federal election. From 1880 onwards, Bismarck was supported by the party, leading to the laws passed during the Kulturkampf being rescinded or made less severe. The conflict ended fully in 1886/1887 with several \"peace laws\". However, the cultural split between the Protestant majority and the Catholic minority remained. The historian Heinrich August Winkler summarised: \"They were [...] no longer marked as Reichsfeinde, but they could have held no illusions about the fact that prejudice survived much longer than paragraphs.\"Heinrich August Winkler: Der lange Weg nach Westen, Bd. 1: Deutsche Geschichte vom Ende des Alten Reiches bis zum Untergang der Weimarer Republik. C.H. Beck, München 2000, S. 222–226 (hier das Zitat).\n\n Anti-Socialist Laws \nTowards the end of the 1870s, Bismarck started attacks against the Social Democrats, whom he distrusted due to their open demand of proletarian revolution: After several attempts failed to limit the freedom of speech of the \"red Reichsfeinde\" through new press laws and the introduction of the criminal offense of \"incitement of class hatred\" in 1874 and 1875, two assssination attempts on Wilhelm I in 1878 gave a pretext for a snap election and the passage of the (Anti-)Socialist Laws. All Social Democratic, Socialist and Communist organisations, assemblies and publications were banned, agitators were liable to be deported, and \"endangered districts\" could be placed under a state of siege. A total of 330 Social Democratic associations were banned, around a 1000 pamphlets seized, and a total of 1500 years of jail time meted out. Only the Social Democratic deputies in the Reichstag were left mostly unharmed and could continue to be elected, as they enjoyed the privilege of parliamentary immunity. Bismarck justified these measures as \"self-defence\". The official aim was to \"save society from murderers and arsonists, from the experience of the Paris Commune.\"Ralph Jessen: Kommune, Attentat, Massenstreik. Arbeiterbewegung, Revolutionsangst und politische Polizei im deutschen Kaiserreich. In: Oliver Auge, Knut-Hinrik Kollex (Hrsg.): Die große Furcht. Revolution in Kiel – Revolutionsangst in der Geschichte. Wachholtz, Kiel/Hamburg 2021, ISBN 978-3-529-09456-9, S. 41–54, hier S. 49. In fact, August Bebel had described that uprising as a \"prelude battle\" in 1871, which would cause an eruption of the entire European proletariat.Michael Epkenhans: Die Reichsgründung 1870/71. C.H. Beck, München 2020, S. 91. The Centre Party agreed with Bismarck's anti-Socialist tendencies, but was reserved about the law, as its subject matter appeared to them as too ill-defined. The Reichstag deputy Peter Reichensperger compared it to the Carlsbad decrees on 16 September 1878:\n\nThree days later, the Reichstag passed the law with a large majority. However, this aim of Bismarck also did not achieve its goal: The Social Democrats founded front organisations such as singing clubs and relief funds, Social Democratic literature was printed in Switzerland and then smuggled into Germany, the electoral gains of the SAP increased steadily after 1884, and in 1890, the party became the largest by number of votes, achieving 19.7% of the popular vote. After Bismarck's dismissal, the Anti-Socialist Laws were no longer extended. Bismarck's hatred for the SPD remained: In 1893, he explained to an American journalist: \"They are the rats of this country and should be eradicated.\"Hans-Ulrich Wehler: Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte, Bd. 3: Von der „Deutschen Doppelrevolution“ bis zum Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges 1849–1914. C.H. Beck, München 1995, S. 902–906, das Zitat S. 905. The severity of the discrimination against the Social Democrats throughout the whole imperial period was anecdotally described by historian Walter Mühlhausen: In 1913, the then-chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg held a short conversation with August Bebel, who was then on his death bed. The SPD chairman subsequently realised that this was \"the first time, that a member of the government has spoken to [him] outside of official negotiations.\"Walter Mühlhausen: Gegen den Reichsfeind – Anmerkungen zur Politik von Staat und Gesellschaft gegenüber der Sozialdemokratie im Kaiserreich. In: Ulrich Lappenküper (Hrsg.): Otto von Bismarck und das „lange 19. Jahrhundert“. Lebendige Vergangenheit im Spiegel der „Friedrichsruher Beiträge“ 1996–2016. Schöningh, Paderborn 2016, S. 329–352, hier S. 330.\n\n Poles \nThe Poles living in the empire were also labelled as Reichsfeinde. This occured in relation to the Kulturkampf, which, according to Norman Davies, turned \"every Polish Catholic instantly into a potential rebel.\"Norman Davies: Im Herzen Europas: Geschichte Polens. C.H. Beck, München 2002, S. 156. Those Poles who inhabited the Western territories of post-partition Poland were, after 1871, no longer citizens of a multi-ethnic Prussia, but of a German nation-state. Bismarck was distrustful towards them: In August 1871, he named the aims of his policies as \"fighting against the Ultramontanist party, especially in the Polish territories.\" He believed that religious education by Catholic priests in those regions would lead to a rise of Polish nationalism, intending to abolish it altogether.Ernst Engelberg: Bismarck. Das Reich in der Mitte Europas. Siedler, Berlin 1990, S. 122 f. In 1872, the Prussian Minister of Culture Adalbert Falk decreed that at all post-primary schools, religion as a subject had to be conducted in the German language.Wolfgang Neugebauer: Das Bildungswesen in Preußen seit der Mitte des 17. Jahrhunderts. In: Otto Büsch (Hrsg.): Handbuch der Preußischen Geschichte, Bd. 2: Das 19. Jahrhundert und Große Themen der Geschichte Preußens. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York 1992, ISBN 3-11-083957-1, S. 605–798, hier S. 743. This had both an anti-Catholic and an anti-Polish intent. Discrimination continued until the end of the empire: After 1886, tens of thousands of Poles with unclear, or with Russian or Austrian citizenship, were deported, even if their families had lived at their homes for generations. The Prussian Settler Comission, founded in 1886, was intended to increase the number of Germans in the provinces of West Prussia and Posen, in 1907, the Reichstag passed a law that allowed for the expropriation of Polish landowners, and in 1901, the language dispute escalated into a school strike at Wreschen. The measures enacted by the Prussian government violated the 1850 Prussian constitution, which guaranteed the legal equality of all citizens in Article 4. Germanisation was not a success. According to Hans-Ulrich Wehler, however, the measures made the German citizenry feel familiar with the fact that there could be \"second-class citizens\".Hans-Ulrich Wehler: Polenpolitik im Deutschen Kaiserreich. In: derselbe: Krisenherde des Kaiserreiches 1871–1918. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2. Auflage, Göttingen 1979, S. 184–202, das Zitat S. 202.\n\n An \"Association of Reichsfeinde\" \nAfter turning towards a more conservative political base in 1878, Bismarck counted the left-leaning Liberals of the German Progress Party (DFP) as Reichsfeinde, since, while supporting the Kulturkampf laws, they were opposed to the Anti-Socialist Laws. In his eyes, they were \"crypto-Republicans\" and nihilists, and had a limited view beyond their desire for progress. Since many Jews voted for the left-leaning Liberals, this polemic also had an antisemitic aspect.Hans-Ulrich Wehler: Das Deutsche Kaiserreich 1871–1918. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, Göttingen 1973, ISBN 3-525-33340-4, S. 96 ff.\n\nFrom the 1880s on, Bismarck described a cooperation between all Reichsfeinde: In 1881, he accused the Centre Party politician Ludwig Windthorst of also supporting the Social Democrats, the Guelph Party as well as the Polish and Alsatian minority parties. He further explained that the harsh measures against Catholicism had been necessary as it was connected to the Polish population \"with national-revolutionary aims, in a chemical bond, so to say.\" In 1885 he predicted that the Jesuits would eventually start leading the Social Democrats.Heinrich August Winkler: Der lange Weg nach Westen, Bd. 1: Deutsche Geschichte vom Ende des Alten Reiches bis zum Untergang der Weimarer Republik. C.H. Beck, München 2000, S. 223; Szilvia Odenwald-Varga: ‚Volk‘ bei Otto von Bismarck. Eine historisch-semantische Analyse anhand von Bedeutungen, Konzepten und Topoi. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York 2009, S. 118 (hier das Zitat) und S. 369, Anm. 664. Later on, he expanded the circle of alleged Reichsfeinde and concoted a conspiracy theory in relation to an affair pertaining to the Hamburg politician Friedrich Heinrich Geffcken:Andrea Hopp: Zu diesem Band. In: Otto von Bismarck. Gesammelte Werke – Neue Friedrichsruher Ausgabe. Abteilung III, Bd. 8, Schöningh, Paderborn 2014, S. XXIV. In a press declaration on 3 October 1888, he accused Geffcken of being a Guelph particularist, who belonged to an \"association of Reichsfeinde\" in union with the Catholics, Social Democrats, left-leaning Liberals and the national minorities. He explained: \"The task these people have made for themselves is the destruction of all that exists presently. They are directing their ambitions against the Protestant Prussian empire.\" Geffcken, he alleged, had supported the occupation of German territory by French troops: \"All Reichsfreunde [friends of the Reich] would have to stand together against these people.\"Otto von Bismarck: Gesammelte Werke – Neue Friedrichsruher Ausgabe. Abteilung III, Bd. 8. Bearbeitet von Andrea Hopp. Schöningh, Paderborn 2014, S. 236 f.\n\nBismarck himself did not believe that the threat he imagined in his conspiracy theory existed: For instance, he did not believe that the Social Democrats could actually pose a revolutionary threat to his government, mainly becuse of their utopian aims. He even believed that they would be \"better\" than the Liberals of the DFP.Hans-Ulrich Wehler: Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte, Bd. 3: Von der „Deutschen Doppelrevolution“ bis zum Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges 1849–1914. C.H. Beck, München 1995, S. 907. After Bismarck's dismissal, the polemics against the Catholic and Social Democrat Reichsfeinde lessened. A more formal end to the persecution marked Wilhelm II's speech in the Reichstag on 4 August 1914, at the start of World War I, in which he declared that he no longer saw parties, but \"only Germans\". This was understood as an offer to former Reichsfeinde to more strongly participate in political decision-making.Steffen Bruendel: Ideologien: Mobilmachungen und Desillusionierungen. In: Niels Werber, Stefan Kaufmann, Lars Koch (Hrsg.): Erster Weltkrieg. Kulturwissenschaftliches Handbuch. Metzler, Stuttgart/Weimar 2014, ISBN 978-3-476-02445-9, S. 280–310, hier S. 280 und 285.\n\n Interpretations \nThere are different explanations and interpretations for why Bismarck persecuted the Reichsfeinde. Hans-Ulrich Wehler analysed Bismarck's attacks as a form of \"negative integration\", a method of ruling in which the \"in-group\" is contrasted with the \"out-group\", with the latter having to appear threatening without actually threatening the system as a whole. Bismarck applied this to the pro-state majority as an \"in-group\" and the Reichsfeinde as the threatening \"out-group\". He conjured up the threat of these minorities to keep his coalition of Reichsfreunde intact. Through this, Bismarck was able to keep up a \"Bonapartist semi-dictatorship\" with himself at the helm.Hans-Ulrich Wehler: Das Deutsche Kaiserreich 1871–1918. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, Göttingen 1973, S. 96 f.; vgl. Andreas Wirsching: Bismarck und das Problem eines deutschen „Sonderwegs“. In: Aus Politik und Zeitgeschichte 65, Heft 13 (2015), S. 9–15, hier S. 12. He intended to force the internal homogenity of the young German nation-state by presenting himself as the \"saviour\" from \"sinister Ultramontanism and Socialist revolutionaries\", positioning himself as a charismatic ruler.Hans-Ulrich Wehler: Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte, Bd. 3: Von der „Deutschen Doppelrevolution“ bis zum Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges 1849–1914. C.H. Beck, München 1995, S. 373 und 953. Yet, on the other hand, Wehler argues that the discrimination against the Reichsfeinde hurt national unity: \"In all, it appeared as though the dogmatically Protestant Bildungsbürger or other bourgeois who was attacking Ultramontanists and Social Democrats was the only acceptable type of nationally thinking German.\"Hans-Ulrich Wehler: Nationalismus. Geschichte, Formen, Folgen. C.H. Beck, München 2001, ISBN 3-406-44769-4, S. 78.\n\nThe linguist Szilvia Odenwald-Varga argues that the constant conjuring of alleged interior and exterior threats to the Reich served the \"integration of the state collective\": In changing coalitions, Bismarck attempted to work, at points, with the Conservatives, then again with the Liberals, in the 1860s even attempting to work with the socialist Ferdinand Lassalle of the ADAV. According to Odenwald-Varga, he fought the Reichsfeinde and then attempted to, at least partially, win them over for his policies.Szilvia Odenwald-Varga: ‚Volk‘ bei Otto von Bismarck. Eine historisch-semantische Analyse anhand von Bedeutungen, Konzepten und Topoi. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York 2009, S. 193 und 464. The historian Dieter Langewiesche opines that the main aim here was the formation of a national identity: Through the persecution and discrimination of enemies, a self-image of the Germans was created. That integrative force of nationalism resulting from these measures was soon strong enough to deconstruct many domestic differences.Dieter Langewiesche: Nation, Nationalismus, Nationalstaat. In Deutschland und Europa. C.H. Beck, München 2000, ISBN 3-406-45939-0, S. 53.\n\nAccording to American historian Otto Pflanze, the repressive tactics applied against the Ultramontanist Catholics and the Social Democrats with the aim of building a national consesus proved counter-productive: Bismarck overestimated the binding force of dynastic loyalty and German patriotism. On the flip side, he underestimated the extent of alienation that those whom he attacked felt, and that the moral force of the religious and social ideals of the persecutees, as well as their will to resist, as strengthened through the persecutions. The sharp words that Bismarck regularly used, Pflanze argues, show a form of \"narcissistic anger\":\n\n Antisemitism \nThe discrimination against Catholics and Social Democrats as Reichsfeinde decreased after 1890. Ethnically defined groups, mainly the Jews, continued to be stigmatised as such. An author of the Catholic Germania newspaper opined during the Berlin antisemitism controversy in 1879, that \"no one had more fervently and outrageously used the terms of Reichsfeind and Staatsfeind than many Jews.\" Those were, according to that same article: \"In their spiritual traits and the character of their customs still a separate race [...], the assimilation of which has not yet succeeded, and perhaps might never succeed.\"Karsten Krieger (Bearb.): Der „Berliner Antisemitismusstreit“ 1879–1881. Eine Kontroverse um die Zugehörigkeit der deutschen Juden zur Nation. Kommentierte Quellenedition. Saur, München 2003, ISBN 3-598-11622-5, Bd. 1, S. 16 f. The developing antisemitism in Germany understood the German Empire as a Volksnation, a racial unit, to which Jews could never belong. Furthermore, similarly to how Bismarck labelled Social Democrats and Catholics, they were accused of having conflicting loyalties, be it to being the Chosen People or to \"international capital\", that was allegedly Jewish-dominated.Hans-Ulrich Wehler: Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte, Bd. 3: Von der „Deutschen Doppelrevolution“ bis zum Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges 1849–1914. C.H. Beck, München 1995, S. 953 f. Jewish industrialists and politicians like Walther Rathenau complained in 1911, that, until proven otherwise, most Germans would believe in the loyalty of all national minorities, however regarding the Jews: \"They are accused, without any evidence, as anti-Nationalist\", and having to justify themselves:\n\nSeveral antisemites used Bismarckian discourse to postulate a \"trias of Reichsfeinde\", consisting of Social Democrats, Catholics and Jews.Werner Bergmann: Haeckel, Ernst Heinrich Philipp August. In: Wolfgang Benz (Hrsg.): Handbuch des Antisemitismus. Judenfeindschaft in Geschichte und Gegenwart, Band 2: Personen. De Gruyter Saur, Berlin 2009, ISBN 978-3-598-44159-2, S. 324. The nationalist Pan-German League continously warned of an alleged fundamental threat through the internal Reichsfeinde (Social Democrats, Jews, Catholics and representatives of the national minorities) as well as external threats (Great Britain, France, Russia). The Pan-Germans usually claimed Bismarck as their reference point.Rainer Hering: „Dem besten Steuermann Deutschlands“. Der Politiker Otto von Bismarck und seine Deutung im radikalen Nationalismus zwischen Kaiserreich und „Drittem Reich“. In: Ulrich Lappenküper (Hrsg.): Otto von Bismarck und das „lange 19. Jahrhundert“. Lebendige Vergangenheit im Spiegel der „Friedrichsruher Beiträge“ 1996–2016.

The publicist Otto Glagau attempted to retroactively brand them as such in his pamphlet Des Reiches Noth und der neue Culturkampf in 1879: Protestants and Catholics should make peace and fight against the Jews as the \"real Reichsfeinde\".Matthew Lange: Der Kulturkämpfer (1880–1888). In: Wolfgang Benz (Hrsg.): Handbuch des Antisemitismus. Band 6: Publikationen. De Gruyter Saur, Berlin 2013, ISBN 978-3-11-025872-1, S. 421. After Bismarck was dismissed, antisemitic publisher Max Brewer criticised Wilhelm II and the new chancellor Leo von Caprivi as, according to Brewer, they \"played right into the hands\" of the domestic Reichsfeinde, particularly the Jews.Werner Bergmann: Bewer, Max [auch: Maximilian, Franz, Xaver]. In: Wolfgang Benz (Hrsg.): Handbuch des Antisemitismus, Bd. 2: Personen. De Gruyter Saur, Berlin 2009, S. 81. The antisemites were strongly opposed by the public, their parties at most received 350.000 votes in imperial elections. Silently, however, the antisemitic exclusionary thinking crept into conservative and liberal circles, without it being publicly expressed.\n\n Weimar Republic \nAfter the defeat of Germany in World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919 in 1918, the former Reichsfeinde became the essential supporting parties of the Weimar Republic. SPD, Centre Party and left-leaning liberal DDP formed the Weimar Coalition of parties loyal to the constitution.Gerhard Schulz: Die Periode der Konsolidierung und der Revision des Bismarckschen Reichsaufbaus 1919–1930 (= Zwischen Demokratie und Diktatur.

This made them a target for hostilities, often with antisemitic undertones. The Reichsfeinde were made responsible for the defeat in the war in the Stab-in-the-back myth by the far-right anti-Republican parties.Detlef Lehnert: Propaganda des Bürgerkrieges? Politische Feindbilder in der Novemberrevolution als mentale Destabilisierung der Weimarer Demokratie. In: derselbe, Klaus Megerle (Hrsg.): Politische Teilkulturen zwischen Integration und Polarisierung. Zur politischen Kultur in der Weimarer Republik.

Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, Göttingen 2001, ISBN 3-525-34028-1, S. 28.\n\nAside from this, the explicit term Reichsfeinde only played a role towards the end of the republic, as president Paul von Hindenburg was disgruntled over the fact that chancellor Heinrich Brüning had made Hindenburg's reelection possible only with the votes of the SPD and the Centre Party, the former Reichsfeinde of Bismarck. Soon after, he dropped Brüning and governed through a series of presidential cabinets.Henning Köhler: Deutschland auf dem Weg zu sich selbst. Eine Jahrhundertgeschichte. Hohenheim-Verlag, Stuttgart 2002, S. 249 f. und 259 f. The historian Konrad Repgen explained the fact that the Centre Party voted for the Enabling Act of 24 March 1933 as a late after-effect of the Kulturkampf: \"The old stigma of being a Reichsfeind, of being a second-class citizen, had continued to be present in silence. The Catholics no longer wanted to be excluded from the national community, they - finally - wanted to be part thereof.\"Zitiert bei Bastian Scholz: Die Kirchen und der deutsche Nationalstaat. Konfessionelle Beiträge zum Systembestand und Systemwechsel. Springer VS, Wiesbaden 2016, S. 313.\n\n Nazi Germany \nThe Nazi regime used the dual terminology of Volks- und Staatsfeinde, meaning \"enemies of the people and state\", to mark, discriminate and persecute Communists, Social Democrats, members of the Labour movement, the German resistance overall, politically active priests, Freemasons, Jews and the Romani.Josephine Ulbricht: Das Vermögen der „Reichsfeinde“. Staatliche Finanzverwaltung und Gegnerverfolgung im nationalsozialistischen Deutschland. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2022, ISBN 978-3-11-076021-7, S. 14. The term Reichsfeinde resurfaced with the \"Decree of the Führer and chancellor regarding the usage of confiscated Reichsfeinde assets\" of 29 May 1941, which transferred confiscated properties of opposition and resistance groups that had been seized by the German states and Nazi Party Gaue to the Reich. The State Secretary in the Reich Ministry of the Interior, Hans Pfundtner, argued: \"Whoever acts as an enemy of the people or the state, does not act against the states, but against the people and the Reich.\"Josephine Ulbricht: Das Vermögen der „Reichsfeinde“. Staatliche Finanzverwaltung und Gegnerverfolgung im nationalsozialistischen Deutschland. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2022, S. 16. \"Enemies of the people and the state\" were now synonymously used with Reichsfeinde.\n\nDiffering from Bismarck, the Nazis used the term Reichsfeinde not just as a descriptor for perceived or real enemies of their own policies, but as a racial-Völkisch classification.Josephine Ulbricht: Das Vermögen der „Reichsfeinde“. Staatliche Finanzverwaltung und Gegnerverfolgung im nationalsozialistischen Deutschland. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2022, S. 14. Reinhard Heydrich, head of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) decreed before the German invasion of Poland that it was the task of the SS Einsatzgruppen, which were to follow the Wehrmacht advance, to \"combat all anti-German elements and Reichsfeinde enemy territory behind the fighting army\". Before the Balkan campaign, he specified that Jews and communists were to be understood as Reichsfeinde.Jürgen Matthäus: Einsatzgruppen. In: Wolfgang Benz (Hrsg.): Handbuch des Antisemitismus. Band 4: Ereignisse, Dekrete, Kontroversen. Berlin/Boston 2011, ISBN 978-3-598-24076-8, S. 95. On 2 July 1940, he noted that, once the German invasion of the Soviet Union had started, the Einsatzgruppen were to \"deal heavy blows against Reichsfeinde throughout the world in the categories of emigrants, Freemasons, Jews and political-religious enemies, and of the Second and Third Internationale.\" In verbal orders to the Einsatzgruppen, the term \"liquidation\" was used, meaning to kill those who the SS got their hands on.Cornelia Schmitz-Berning: Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York 2007, ISBN 978-3-11-092864-8, S. 172. The number of people murdered on Soviet territory by the Einsatzgruppen is estimated to be at least half a million.Jürgen Matthäus: Einsatzgruppen. In: Wolfgang Benz (Hrsg.): Handbuch des Antisemitismus. Band 4: Ereignisse, Dekrete, Kontroversen. Berlin/Boston 2011, S. 96. This is also about the same number of German Jews that were deported to ghettos and extermination camps and died there. Their assets fell to the Reich.Josephine Ulbricht: Das Vermögen der „Reichsfeinde“. Staatliche Finanzverwaltung und Gegnerverfolgung im nationalsozialistischen Deutschland.

        "content": "José Francisco Leitaõ (5 June 1925 – 31 March 1997), known professionally as Jephsis Hitler, was an Indian comedian, actor, singer, composer, and playwright who worked on the Konkani stage.\n\nCareer\nLeitaō was a popular figure in the Goan theater tradition known as tiatr during the mid-20th century. He began his stage career performing in local village concerts, where he demonstrated talent as both a singer and comedic actor. One of Leitaō's strengths was his ability to convincingly portray Kunbi characters. \"He had a natural knack for capturing the distinct Kunbi accent, and when dressed in traditional Kunbi attire, his characterizations were considered flawless,\" writes historian Wilson Mazarello. Leitaö's expanding renown in the local Chinchinim community led to invitations to showcase his talents in tiatrs, traditional Goan plays, throughout the wider Salcete region of Goa. Leading tiatr directors of the time, including Edward Almeida, Minguel Rod, Jacinto Vaz, Saluzinho, Kamat de Assolna, Dioguinho D'Mello, Aleixinho de Candolim, and C. Alvares, sought to feature Leitaõ in their productions. \n\nDue to Leitaō's small stature, humorous character, and skills in singing and acting, he swiftly endeared himself to audiences who frequented tiatrs, especially in the Salcete region. His performances often drew sold-out crowds. In addition to his skills as a performer, Leitaō was known for his proficiency in composing musical arrangements, with a focus on creating pieces for duets, trios, and quartets. As a new generation of tiatr directors emerged, Leitaō continued collaborating with talents such as Nelson Afonso, A. S. Conception, Kamat de Assolna, and Aristides Dias. Leitaō also authored several tiatrs himself, including works titled Xevtteam Gantonn, Belgaumcar, Mogachi Justis, Chouto Upordes, Kunnbi Niklau, Bhau ani Zau, and Bakro Amge Zalem.\n\nLeitaõ authored and staged several tiatr productions over the course of his career.\nHis first tiatr work, titled \"Xeutteamchi Ganthon, critiqued the corrupt legal system of the time, in which lawyers were allegedly susceptible to bribery in exchange for a \"ganthon\" (braid) of mullets. Following this early commentary, Leitaő went on to write and perform in a variety of other tiatrs, often collaborating with well-established commercial tiatrists. Some of his popular works included \"Bhavart\" (Faith), \"Belgaumkar\" (Belgaum-based), \"Onupkari Put' (Ungrateful Son), \"Chouto Upordhes,\" \"Mogachi Justis\" (Loving Justis), \"Kunnbi Niklau (Kunbi Niklau), \"Bacro Amje Zalem,\" \"Bhau Ani Zau,\" and \"Bhognnar Putache, among others. In addition to his writing and directing, Leitaō was also an actor and singer, and he participated in tiatrs produced by other artists. Minguel Rod recognized the acting and singing abilities of Leitaõ, prompting an invitation to join a theatrical production called \"Intruz Vo Carnaval\" in Bombay. His performance in Minguel Rod's \"Intruz Vo Carnaval\" helped establish Leitaõ as a leading Goan comedian. \n\nLeitaõ captivated and enthralled tiatr audiences with his comedic prowess, eliciting laughter and earning acclaim for his performances. His popularity soared as he became an entertainer among theatergoers. Leitaō's comedic abilities were further showcased in his acclaimed portrayals in John Claro's \"Gupit Karann\" (Secret Reason), which received praise in both Goa and Bombay. Other tiatr directors, such as M. Boyer and Roam Tony, also featured Leitaō in their productions, including \"Atam Konn Ghatki?\" (Now, who is the traitor?), staged in Bombay, and \"Deodita\" (God-given). Leitao's humor and comedic skills caught the attention of Jacinto Vaz, who cast him in the production \"Kunhad Ani Mana\" performed in Africa in 1957. Leitao further showcased his talent by presenting his famous act \"Kunnbi Niclau\" at the audience's behest, solidifying his reputation as a versatile and crowd-pleasing performer. Throughout his career, Leitaō was known for his comedic flair, which delighted tiatr-going audiences in Goa and beyond.\n\nLeitaõ was known for his versatile vocal abilities, delivering a wide range of songs as a soloist and in ensemble pieces such as duets, trios, and quartets. His duet performances as a Kunbi character alongside Anita de Goa were favored by the audience, showcasing their popularity and appeal in the entertainment realm. Despite his diminutive stature, Leitaō commanded a strong presence on the Konkani stage. He collaborated with several popular actors and playwrights over the course of his career, including Luciano Dias, who later achieved fame in his own right within the Konkani theater community. Leitaō was primarily celebrated for his comedic abilities. His distinctive physicality, including his gait and body language, as well as his wordplay, regularly elicited laughter from tiatr audiences. Because of his diminutive stature, he excelled in comedic roles. The future Konkani playwright and politician Tomazinho Cardozo attended Leitaō's performances in his youth. In addition to his solo comedic work, Leitaō also participated in comic duet routines during tiatr productions. In one particular tiatr directed by Aristides Dias, he appeared alongside another comedian, Luis Rod, who portrayed a female character. Leitaő's small stature contrasted humorously with Rod's taller, more feminine appearance, further entertaining the viewers.\n\nLeitaō and Luis Rod were a popular Goan comedy duo known for their performances in tiatrs (Konkani plays). Their significant height difference was a key part of their act, often eliciting laughter from audiences. In one noted instance, the taller Luis Rod, who frequently portrayed female characters, easily lifted and carried the smaller Leitaō on his back during a performance, a memorable moment in their collaborative work, writes Tomazinho Cardozo. Beyond their physical comedy, Leitaō also earned acclaim for his skilled portrayals of Kunbi characters, drawing on his familiarity with the Kunbi dialect used by many native Goans. Leitaō's skills as a playwright were acknowledged for his creation of tiatrs that delved into contemporary events and societal matters pertinent to the Goan community, shedding light on these subjects on the Konkani theatrical platform. Leitaō's comedic career unfolded during a period dominated by two of the popular Konkani stage performers - Jacinto Vaz, known as the \"Charlie Chaplin of the Konkani stage,\" and Anthony Mendes, the \"Spring Man of the Konkani stage.\" Despite the prominence of these figures, Leitaō was able to establish his own respected place within the Konkani theatrical landscape through his talents, writes Cardozo. In the later stages of his career, Leitaō ultimately retired from the Konkani theatre due to the effects of advancing age and declining health.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1925 births\nCategory:1997 deaths\nCategory:Goan people\nCategory:Tiatrists\nCategory:People from South Goa district\nCategory:Konkani-language singers",

        "content": "Luis Urquiri Uraín (1 September 1906 – 1 May 1979) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Deportivo Alavés and Atlético Madrid,\n\nHe later became a manager, achieving 4 promotions to the first division with four different clubs, Deportivo de La Coruña, CD Málaga, Real Zaragoza, and Real Oviedo, doing it so in just five years (1947–1952).\n\nPlaying career\nLuis Urquiri was born on 1 September 1906 in Deba, Gipuzkoa, and began his footballing career at  in 1923, at the age of 17, with whom he played for two years until 1925, when he was signed by Deportivo Alavés. He stayed loyal to the club for a decade, from 1925 to 1935, playing in the inaugural season of the Segunda División in 1929, and playing a pivotal role, together with the likes of Manuel Olivares, Andrés Calero, and Jacinto Quincoces under coach Francisco Baonza, in helping Alavés achieve promotion to La Liga in 1930. With Alavés, he played a total of 50 top division matches in three seasons between 1930 and 1933, the year in which the club got relegated back to the second division.\n\nWhen the Spanish Civil War ended in 1939, Urquiri joined Atlético Aviación, the future Atlético Madrid, where he was a member of Athletic's historic 1939–40 season, in which the club won the 1939 Campeonato Mancomunado Centro in November, the 1939–40 La Liga in April, and the 1940 Spanish Super Cup in September, under coach Ricardo Zamora, playing seven league matches during that season, including in the decisive match against Valencia CF in the last day of the league on 28 April (2–0). In the Super Cup, he only played in the second leg, helping his side to a 7–1 win over RCD Espanyol to seal a 10–4 aggregate victory. In the following season, Atlético won league again, but this time Urquiri did not play a major role in this triumph as he only played four La Liga matches before being replaced by Manín of Racing de Santander. In total, Urquiri played 61 La Liga matches, 50 for Alavés and 11 for Atlético.\n\nIn 1940, Urquiri joined Imperio CF, which at the time served as a subsidiary of Atlético Aviación, and he then went on to play for both Alicante CF and Hércules CF before retiring in 1943, at the age of 37.\n\nManagerial career\nBack-to-back promotions with Coruña and Málaga\nAfter his career as a player ended, Urquiri remained linked to Hércules, now as a coach, which he oversaw in two stages, first in 1942–43 as a Player-coach, and then in 1945–47, being unable to avoid relegation to the second division in 1946. He also returned to Imperio of Tercera División for one season in 1943–44, in which the club participated in the Copa del Rey for the first time, beating CD Toledo (9–0), RSD Alcalá (1–2), and CD Acero in the previous qualifying rounds to be eliminated by Albacete Balompié in fifth round (1–4 on aggregate).\n\nAs a coach, Urquiri specialized himself in achieving promotions to the first division, doing so in back-to-back seasons with Deportivo de La Coruña (1947–48) and CD Málaga (1948–49). At the beginning of the 1948–49 season with Málaga, he hired  to play as goalkeeper, Manuel González as a defender, who went from the most insulted player in La Rosaleda Stadium, \"González, the criminal defender of Granada\", to become \"the honorable Gonzalez\"; and the third on the list of reinforcements for Urquiri was , a veteran who had helped him in the promotion of Coruña. This Málaga side was the one that conceded the fewest goals and only lost six games on its way to promotion, which was achieved on the last matchday with a 5–1 away victory over Racing de Ferrol to finish level on points with both Real Sociedad and Granada, but ahead of the latter on head-to-head goal difference.\n\nReal Zaragoza\nDespite this encouraging first steps with Málaga, the club's president Navarro Nogueroles fired him with the false allegation of his financial demands, so he went to Zaragoza to achieve his third promotion in as many tries. Urquiri, who was warned that he had full powers to make the lineup, signed for Zaragoza on 21 June for 100,000 pesetas and a succulent promotion bonus, stating \"I promise to work instead of talking. My motto is to work hard and speak only what is essential. The climb will be difficult\". Once Urquiri was hired, Zaragoza immediately got to work configuring a squad for promotion, a squad that, for the first time in its history, was not going to have any Aragonese player due to the retirement of Víctor and the end of Malo and Montolio's contracts. He signed several players in June, such as the wingers Roig II and Paco Pitarch, the veteran midfielder Isidoro Urra, and the defender Calo, the brother of César. The best ones, however, came in the last week of August, when Zaragoza unexpectedly signed both Rosendo Hernández and Gonzalvo II, who were just coming off from the 1950 World Cup in Brazil; the former through a transfer of 600,000 pesetas, a fortune for the time, and the latter through a three-year contract and with a bonus of 200,000 pesetas for each season, becoming the first player with a car in the history of Zaragoza. This heave spending earned Zaragoza the nickname of 'millionaire' and the status of most favorite ascent; between transfers, bonuses, and monthly salaries, the cost of the 1950–51 squad exceeded four million pesetas, a great figure for a Second Division team.\n\nAlthough Zaragoza never dropped below second place in the 1950–51 season, a scandalous defeat in Gijón hurt them greatly and coach Urquiri began to be seriously questioned. A defeat to the very modest Gimnástica de Tarragona ended up complicating things more because it served as a direct promotion to Gijón, so everyone became nervous due to the colossal economic effort made. A new defeat in Tarragona against the bottom team left Zaragoza already five points behind the leader Gijón and it put an end to the diminished credit of Urquiri, who was soft and excessively contemplative with the players, and always seemed overwhelmed by the theoretical favoritism from Zaragoza. He was dismissed the next day, on 2 April 1951, although the decision was disguised with the surprising euphemism that he was going to be absent from the city for a few days \"for vacation\", being replaced by Juanito Ruiz. Urquiri was silent for three weeks, but eventually stated that: \"Between me and a board that cannot leave, I have chosen to sacrifice myself. I am happy to have left the team in second place in the standings, although the board has not forgiven me for Zaragoza not being first. The team has given the performance that I expected. No more no less\". Zaragoza could not reach the direct promotion, but its second place allowed them to compete in the play-offs, which they won.\n\nUrquiri remains the Zaragoza coach with the third-most weeks at the top, with five weeks in the 1950–51 Second division, one more than in the 1955–56 season with Mundo, which also ended in promotion; but behind Arsenio with seven (1977–78), and Paco Flores with eight (2002–03). In total, Urquiri coached 27 matches in Zaragoza, 16 wins, 5 draws, and 6 losses for an unbeaten ratio of 22.22%, which is the fourth best among Zaragoza coaches only behind Arsenio with 21.05% (1977–78), Rafael Iriondo with 18.75% (1971–72), and Marcelino García Toral with 16.67% (2008–09), all of which also went on to achieve promotion to the first division. The then Zaragoza goalkeeper Candi later described the coach Urquiri as a \"serious, practical, he did not like nonsense. He worked hard to make such a different squad get along, something that is fundamental in football then and now\".\n\nReal Oviedo and Celta de Vigo\nOn 15 August 1951, Urquiri replaced De las Alas to take charge of Real Oviedo, which he guided to a streak of 563 minutes without conceding a single goal in the 1951–52 Segunda División, the club's second-best record only behind the 578-minutes in 1971–72 season. This streak proved to be crucial in leading his side to yet another promotion to the first division in 1952 (this time as champions), his fourth promotion in just five years, and this time he remained as coach to finally return to La Liga for the first time since his days at Hércules. On 2 November 1952, Urquiri led Oviedo to a 3–1 victory over Real Madrid that saw them in fifth position in the league table, shared with Valencia and just five points behind the leader, Espanyol. On 5 April 1953, Oviedo scored its 700th goals in La Liga in a 6–3 win over Real Valladolid.\n\nIn 1953, Urquiri took a break in his career with Oviedo to briefly coach Celta de Vigo, which was immersed in the relegation zone to the Second Division. He arrived in Vigo in May, replacing Armando Márquez, and made his debut with Celta against Atlético Tetuán on 31 May 1953, which ended in a 4–1 win. Urquiri managed to pull off the escape from relegation, but only thanks to the resignation of España Industrial, which recognized its affiliation to FC Barcelona. He then returned to Oviedo, which he coached until 1954, when he took charge of Racing de Santander for one season (1954–55).\n\nFor the 1955–56 season, Urquiri was once again hired by Celta after Antonio Barrios, who already had an agreement with Celta, left for Atlético Madrid. The coach kept Celta in the quiet zone in a good season in which the Vigo forward Mauro almost reached the Pichichi Trophy, falling just one goal short of Alfredo Di Stéfano. At the end of the season, Urquiri left the team, being replaced by Alejandro Scopelli.\n\nLater career\nUrquiri's last coaching job was at his former club Deportivo Alavés for two seasons between 1956 and 1958, and another one in 1965–66, at the age of 59. In total, he coached 105 La Liga games with a balance of 35 wins, 17 draws, and 53 losses, with his teams scoring 165 goals, but conceding 222.\n\nOutside of football\nIn October 1950, Urquiri appeared as a petitioner to the industry delegations of Alava in respect of setting up an industry of engine rectifications.\n\nDeath\nUrquiri died on 1 May 1979, at the age of 72.\n\nHonours\nPlayer\nDeportivo Alavés\nSegunda División:\nWinners (1) 1929–30\n\nAtlético Aviación\nCampeonato Regional Centro:\nChampions (1):1939\n\nLa Liga:\nChampions (2): 1939–40 and 1940–41\n\nSpanish Super Cup\nChampions (1): 1940\n\nCoach\nReal Oviedo\nSegunda División:\nWinners (1) 1951–52\n\n References \n\nCategory:1906 births\nCategory:1979 deaths\nCategory:Footballers from Gipuzkoa\nCategory:Spanish men's footballers\nCategory:Men's association football midfielders\nCategory:La Liga players\nCategory:Deportivo Alavés players\nCategory:Atlético Madrid footballers\nCategory:Hércules CF players\nCategory:Spanish football managers\nCategory:Hércules CF managers\nCategory:Deportivo de La Coruña managers\nCategory:CD Málaga managers\nCategory:Real Zaragoza managers\nCategory:Real Oviedo managers\nCategory:Racing de Santander managers\nCategory:RC Celta de Vigo managers\nCategory:Deportivo Alavés managers",

        "content": "Harpocration of Argos () was an Ancient Greek Middle Platonist philosopher who lived in the second half of the 2nd century CE.\n\nLife\nAll that is known about Harpocration's early life is that he came from Argos. He was a student of the Middle Platonist Atticus. According to the Suda, he was a confidant (symbiōtḗs) of an emperor; presumably not Marcus Aurelius, who would have mentioned him otherwise in the Meditations.\n\nHarpocration had previously been identified with a grammarian of the same name who was the teacher of the emperor Lucius Verus, however this identification has been rejected by more recent research because it is not chronologically consistent for a student of Atticus (fl. c. 175) to have been a teacher to an emperor born in 130.\n\nWorks\nOnly a few fragments of Harpocration's works have survived. In the Suda two works are attributed to him: a commentary on the works of Plato in 24 books and a Platonic lexicon in two books. The extent fragments come from Plato's commentary. The dialogues expounded in this work included Alcibiades I, Phaedo, Phaedrus, Republic and Timaeus.\n\nDoctrines\nAlthough Harpocration was a student of Atticus, his philosophical views show some similarity to those of the Pythagoreanizing Platonist Numenius of Apamea. Like Numenius, he assumes three gods or three aspects of divinity, namely one aspect for the supreme, inactive god and two aspects for the creator god (Demiurge), whom he considers to be double or divided into two aspects. On the other hand, in the controversial question of the Eternity of the world, like Atticus, Harpocration represents the opinion rejected by Numenius that the creation of the world described in the Timaeus is to be understood as a real process in time, and therefore not purely metaphorical. Like Atticus, he considers the world as something created to be potentially transitory, but imperishable by the will of the Demiurge. Like Numenius, he also regards every incarnation of the soul as an evil, because he sees the body as the source of evil in the soul. He attributes immortality not only to human souls, but also to those of animals.\n\nLegacy\nThe late antique Neoplatonist Proclus mentions Harpocration in a list of important Platonists and criticizes his theology. Other late antique Neoplatonists (Iamblichus, Hermias, Damascius, and Olympiodorus the Younger) as well as the Christian philosopher Aeneas of Gaza also mention him.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n \n \n \n\nCategory:Middle Platonists\nCategory:2nd-century Greek philosophers",

        "content": "Carl Schleicher (born Cölestin Schleicher, 1825October 2, 1903) was a realistic painter from the 19th century.Dimitra Reimüller, 19th Century Paintings: Carl (Cölestin) Schleicher,  Dorotheum, 2014\n\n Life \n\nSchleicher was born in Lemberg (now Lviv), but he acquired his education in the field of painting mainly in Vienna between the years 1860 and 1870. He was a student of the Austrian painter Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller.\n\nSchleicher is especially known for portrait paintings of faces, as well as interpretive paintings of rabbis who study the Talmud. A considerable amount of his paintings are oil paintings.\n\nHis paintings are an authentic record of Jewish culture and customs, as well as the rabbinic form of learning. These paintings have been exhibited several times at the Austrian Art Club (Österreichisches Kunstverein).\n\nSchleicher's paintings are both interpretive and precise. He is depicting the pointed scholastic atmosphere of the Jewish rabbis studying the Talmud.  One can see the heat of the debate on the faces and movements of the characters.\n\nSchleicher died in Padua, Kingdom of Italy, in 1903.\"Carl Schleicher\", Arcadja, accessed June 5, 2014.\n\n370px|thumbnail|right|Carl Schleicher, A Question About the Talmud, oil on canvas, c. 1860-71.Eventually, this work has been exhibited as A Discussion of the Talmud (Sotheby's, New York, 2011: ecatalogue/2011/important-judaica-n08814/lot.59.html A Discussion of the Talmud). However, on the reverse, the painting bears the inscription: \"Eine rei Frage aus dem Talmud\", implying that the theme of the work is A question from the Talmud or A question about the Talmud. Indeed, presenting a rabbi explaining a certain passage of the Talmud before a group of five scholars, the image in question has less to do with a discussion than with a rabbinic exegesis, this being corroborated by the German inscription on the back of the work.  Private collection\n\n Name \n\nAlthough Schleicher was initially known in his hometown as Cölestin Schleicher, later he exhibited his work  in Vienna and was acclaimed as Carl Schleicher, which is how he is mostly known since.BBC of London, Sotheby's, Invaluable, Art Price, Ask Art, Identification of the painter's signature in Find Art Info\n\n Paintings \n\nDisciple of the Austrian painter Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller, Schleicher developed his work in costumbrist style, mainly in Vienna between 1859 and 1871. On several occasions he exhibited his work at the Österreichisches Kunstverein (Austrian Arts Club).Obituary published in Neue Freie Presse, October 2, 1903 (Dimitra Reimüller). Showing familiarity with Jewish life, Schleicher exhibited genre paintings with Jewish scenes.Boris Wilnitsky, Carl Schleicher, Fine Art, Vienna, consulted January 22, 2016.\n\nHe specialized in oil painting and shows the influence of Dutch Golden Age painting of the 17th century.\n\nSchleicher is particularly known for the anecdotal component of his work. He individually portrayed the different characteristic types of his time, some of them dedicated to reading or writing. Among these works, The Drinker, The Card Player and The Musician stand out. The Scribe involves a Benedictine monk with glasses, busy writing something that he inscribes with the help of a pen on several papers. Preserved in the Bury Art Museum in Manchester, Study of an Old Man presents an old man with a cigar and a beer jug.\n\nSome of Schleicher's paintings present genre scenes, such as Tavern Scene,Tavern Scene, c. 1870 (image). Drinkers, In the tavern and The chess players.\n\nOther works have a certain intimacy, notably La toilette and Grandma's birthday.In German, Der Geburtstag der Großmutter (image). The anecdotal nature of Schleicher's painting is in turn evident in works such as Thief in the artist's studio, Long live the wine, The broken container, A rare piece and The winning hand .The Winnig Hand (The Winnig Hand) features an eighteenth-century pair of card players; one of the gentlemen is advised by a third party (image ).\n\nSchleicher also painted groups of priests and rabbis. The figure of the Christian priest is introduced individually in Old Man Writing a Diary and is taken up in group terms in The Chess Players, where a Benedictine monk measures himself against a Dominican one, while another, a Franciscan, observes the game between the two. As far as Judaism is concerned, Schleicher was particularly interested in rabbinic activity around the Talmud, thus creating works such as Rabbis in debate and A Talmudic dispute.\n\n Paintings of rabbis and talmudists \n\nA part of Carl Schleicher's output is closely related to Judaism and Ashkenazi life. The exchange of ideas and interpretations between the rabbis and talmudists was a topic to which Schleicher dedicated a considerable number of oil paintings. Loaded with anecdotal material, such paintings constitute a valuable record of the practices and customs of Ashkenazi Jews in Europe, whose culture and heritage are known as Yiddishkayt.Among them The highlights include Any controversy from the Talmud (Eine Streitfrage aus dem Talmud), Rabbi scholars in a Debate, Talmudic Discussion, A Talmudic issue in dispute (An Issue of Dispute in the Talmud), and A Talmudic Dispute (Ein Talmudstreit); The titles of his works listed here are consonant with those of his works exhibited at MutualArt (accessed June 5, 2014). Schleicher's record is valuable because most of Europe's Ashkenazi communities and their cultural diversity have been lost due to the Shoah.\n\nThe theme addressed by Schleicher concerns both the Jewish dialectical-exegetical experience and modern art. Schleicher's paintings are characterized by being not only descriptive, but also by sharply capturing the atmosphere of study that governed the life of the Talmudists: seriousness and dedication, with interesting dialogues and surprising ideas, but also problematic contradictions, endless arguments and humor.\n\n External links \n\n Works by Carl Schleicher on Mutual Art\n\n References ",

As of September 2022, the club is currently not fielding any teams.N.A.F.I. Stuttgart e. V. In: fussball.de, accessed on September 1, 2022\n\n History \nThe club originated from an amateur team that was founded around 2005. Five years later, the team joined the Türk SC Stuttgart. After this club dissolved, the team continued to play as Hilalspor Stuttgart. In 2013, the club was renamed to NAFI Stuttgart. As the Württemberg Football Association believed that NAFI was a family name and therefore not allowed as a club name, periods were inserted between the letters. According to the club president, NAFI stands for Neuer Amateurfußball international (New international amateur football). However, the club's website states that the name derives from the sponsor Nafis Bakirci.\n\n Futsal \nUnder the name TSC Stuttgart, the team first qualified for the DFB-Futsal-Cup in 2008 and became German futsal vice champions after a 3:6 defeat in the final against UFC Münster. After being eliminated prematurely in 2009, 2012 and 2013, the club won the German championship in 2014. After defeating Hamburg Panthers and UFC Münster, the Stuttgart team reached the final again, where they beat Holzpfosten Schwerte 5:3. The following year, Schwerte took revenge with a 10:4 victory in the semifinals. For unknown reasons, Stuttgart did not participate in the newly introduced Regionalliga Süd in 2015 and instead played in the second division.\n\n Football \nNAFI Stuttgart was also active in football. The first team was promoted to the Bezirksliga Stuttgart in 2015 and to the Landesliga in 2017. At the winter break of the 2018/19 season, NAFI was in second place in the Landesliga, but due to unpaid wages and internal disputes within the club,teckbote.de: Nafi Stuttgart droht der Zerfall (8.

Saatchi described the potential to create a \"generative TV\" service where fans can create and share their own episodes, or to allow writers or directors to realize their own original projects. SHOW-1 was heavily criticized by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, who were on strike at the time over the risk of their careers getting automated.

Devin Coldewey of TechCrunch, in contrast, said of one of the epsiodes, \"Although I wouldn’t say the episode is funny, it does have a beginning, a middle and an end, and distinct characters (including lots of fake celebrity cameos, including fake Meryl Streep).\"\n\nthumb|right|According to Fable Studio, Showrunner will allow users to create a custom episode given a plot, scene descriptions, and more specific elements like dialogue and shots.\n\nIn June 2024, Fable Studio announced a streaming service, also titled Showrunner, that will allow users to create and share their own episodes using AI in a similar format as the South Park demos.

        "content": "Abbot Kinney's Venice Pier, also known as the Abbot Kinney Pier, the first Venice Pier, Venice Amusement Pier, the Windward Avenue Pier, or the Venice Wharf, stood over the Pacific Ocean at Venice, Los Angeles County, California, United States, from 1905 until it was destroyed in the 1920 Abbot Kinney pier fire.\n\n History \nCommissioned by real estate developer Abbot Kinney as part of his \"Venice of America\", the pier was  long. The Ship Cafe was built at the same time, and was originally intended to be a full-service resort \"with sleeping apartments, a restaurant, a kitchen, office and all of the appointments of the modern hotel\".\n\nThe Venice Auditorium performance venue at the end of the pier had 3,600 seats. The Venice Plunge indoor saltwater swimming pool, which  was located around the corner on Ocean Front Walk, had 1,500 dressing rooms at opening.\n\nthumb|Crowd on Venice Amusement Pier \n\nThe Venice Aquarium was a double-duty tourist attraction and marine mammal research facility. Along the boardwalk of the pier were approximately 40 concessions and rides including the Ocean Inn, pool hall, bowling alley, merry-go-round, the \"Joy Wheel,\" the Whip, the Virginia Reel, the Over the Falls, the Captive Aeroplanes, a \"pigsty slide with a large number of small animals,\" the Longworthy fish market, The Steeplechase, Hilarity Hall, a seaplane ride, glassblowers, a Ferris wheel, a shooting gallery, the \"Old Mill,\" the Dipper, and Stimpson's candy shop. The pier had an automobile parking garage as of 1920.\n\nThe pier was damaged by storms on multiple occasions, the two most notable being the nearly finished pier being wrecked by high waves and wind prior to the 1905 opening, and the New Year's Day 1914 storm that caused $100,000 in damages.\n\n 1920 pier fire \n\nThe Venice Pier caught fire on December 20, 1920, just a month after the death of its developer, Abbot Kinney. The fire was first discovered in the dance hall; as the fire rose around them, the band played a rousing march to rally the guests through an orderly evacuation. The dance hall was located on the north side of the pier, about  west of the water line.\n\nFirefighter Arthur Harlan was killed with the wall of the Ocean Inn collapsed on top of him.\n\n Additional images \n\n See also \n Venice Short Line\n Venice Miniature Railway\n Venice Fishing Pier\n\n References \n\n Sources \n\n \n \n \n\nCategory:1905 establishments in California\nCategory:1920 disestablishments in California\nCategory:Piers in Los Angeles County, California\nCategory:Venice, Los Angeles\nCategory:Defunct amusement parks in California\nCategory:Tourist attractions in Los Angeles County, California",

        "content": "Robert Joseph \"Bob\" Gans (October 27, 1887September 17, 1959) was the \"slot-machine king\" of the Los Angeles underworld during the interwar period, and later a philanthropist and civic leader. For many years, he ran the board of Mt. Sinai Hospital, now Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Gans was one of the most circumspect figures in the history of organized crime in southern California, but he was associated with both Charlie Crawford's City Hall Gang of the 1920s and Guy McAfee's Syndicate in the 1930s. \n\nThe finances of the slot-machine kingdomwhich was built by Bob Gans with his older brothers Joe Gans and Charlie Gansare poorly understood but the amalgamated best guesstimates of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the handful of local crime-beat newspaper reporters who were not personally graft-adjacent seems to suggest that Gans' operation may have had gross revenues over 20 years of approximately  and top-line profits for the proprietors over the same period of, at minimum, .\n\n Early career \nGans was born in New York where \"the name Gans was huge in New York tobacconist circles.\" Gans started his career as an employee of his two brothers, Jonas Joseph \"Joe\" Gans (1875–1926) and Charles J. Gans (1880–1961), who by the turn of the 20th century had \"a pair of cigar shops on Spring Street\" operating under the business name J. J. Gans & Bro. According to a 1952 Los Angeles Daily News series on the history of crime in the city: \"Two brothers who were engaged in the wholesale tobacco business were quick to see the power for profit from slot machines. They acquired a few and installed them around the city. The brothers were Bob and Joe Gans, the latter now dead for many years. The boys were favorably known in Los Angeles as legitimate businessmen and were well-liked. They were gentlemen and had taken a modest interest in municipal and county elections, staking various candidates to financial help.\" For example, in 1924, according to the Municipal League of Los Angeles, half of the $2,069 campaign budget reported by Superior Court judge Hugh J. Crawford was provided by his campaign manager, Robert J. Gans.\nalt=Junction_at_Main_Street,_Spring_Street,_and_9th_Street,_Los_Angeles,_ca.1917_(CHS-5767)|thumb|Junction of Main Street, Spring Street, and 9th Street, Los Angeles, , with a Gans Bros. sign visible above the wedge behind the Anheiser-Busch sign; the Gans Brothers Building (located at 814 Spring Street and now called Tomahawk Lofts) is landmarked since 2002 as Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 737 \nthumb|Gans Brothers Electrical Stores advertisement, The Los Angeles Times, November 10, 1919\nIn this era, there were countless venues for Gans Brothers products, and their importance only grew as the Roaring Twenties collapsed into the Great Depression: \"Slot machines could be found in the rear of many restaurants. Pinball machines that paid off in cash helped pay the rent in many small-business establishments\". Many of the sins attributed to Prohibition were equally associated with gambling, which was America's biggest underworld business by 1931. Many of the places in Los Angeles that were storied \"secret\" bars were also secret or not-so-secret casinos. For example, at Frank Sebastian's Cotton Club on Washington Boulevard, half the reason for the floor show and the \"brassy band\" was to \"drown out the sounds from the casino upstairs\". Charles J. Lick claimed to believe he was leasing the \"submarine garden\" hidden below his Dome Pier to honest aficionados of billiards, but after the heavily guarded basement casino outfitted like a \"junior Monte Carlo concession\" was raided four times, he canceled the lease. Jack Doyle's place in Vernon had alcohol after neighboring Los Angeles passed the Gandier ordinanceand a card room. Generally speaking, coin-operated slot machines and pinball machines were a poor man's game, that brought in a flow of cash with a profit margin ample enough to make their operators rich over time. There were slots and pinball machines in the back of just about every bar, nightclub, pool hall, amusement park, carnival, ice-cream parlor, and drugstore in the Greater Los Angeles area during the interwar period, and as one nostalgic account put it, \"It is probably true that the pinball business was not simon pure...It is probably true that bars paid off big-hitters with beers, and tobacco shops paid off big-hitters with cigars. It is probably true that, worse, money changed hands. It is probably true that more than one L.A. schoolboy spent his lunch money and carfare in a pinball machine and had to walk home from school hungry.\" A darker interpretation claims that Al Capone once said he'd give up every other criminal enterprise if he could have slot machines, and that slot machines were invented the day the devil was accidentally left in charge of the world. \nthumb|Undated image of slot machine and dice table confiscated in a raid at the \"Pico Palace\" \nAfter \"bell\" slot machines were banned over the course of the 1920s and 1930s in various California jurisdictions, they were replaced by pinball machines, which at that time were not games of skill with flippers and lights, but rather \"a gambling game, a bingo game, [where] there isn't any play. You put in your nickel and five balls are released. You shoot the balls and watch them drop into a pattern of 25 holes, each one guarded by a series of pins the size of finishing nails. Each hole is numbered, each number corresponds to a bingo kind of board on the back-box. If you get three, four or five in a row you win 4, 16 or 75 to 1, unless you've pumped in some extra nickels and succeeded in changing the odds to 8, 24 and 96 to 1 or up to 192, 480, and 600 to 1. There's no play. The ball rolls, and you're as helpless to direct it as you are to affect the wheels on a slot machine\". A 1925 article about Ocean Park refusing to allow J. J. Gans to operate \"peppermint vending machines\" in the town stated that representatives for the company insisted that \"the machines were absolutely within the law, had been decided so by many court decisions and that every time a customer put a nickel in machine he received a five-cent package of mints. Sometimes they received more, but never less\". The brothers were described as \"wealthy inventors of gambling devices\" in September of that year, after being arrested in Avalon on Catalina Island \"on charges of maintaining gambling devices in the form of slot machines....According to deputy sheriffs who made the arrest, the two Gans brothers maintained 11 slot machines which paid off in cash instead of the usual trade checks. Justice Hunter notified authorities that he had been warned to lay off the prosecution of the Gans brothers and had been threatened with the loss of his position should he continue with the case\". \n\nJoe Gans died suddenly in 1926 at Lavida Hot Springs in Orange County's Carbon Canyon, leaving an estate reported to be worth . In 1927, Bob Gans returned profit he'd made on Julian Petroleum \"stock pools\"\"Julian Pete\" having turned out to be a massive scam that defrauded thousands of people of millions of dollars. Gans was also an investor in Baron Long's Agua Caliente resort and racetrack in Mexico, which opened in 1928. A new district attorney, Buron Fitts, targeted gambling beginning in 1928, repealing a \"city ordinance that had legalized slot machines\" and raiding \"downtown nightclubs and gambling ships off Long Beach,\" but this did not seem to meaningfully disrupt the Gans operation. The Internal Revenue Service believed that the Gans brothers made profits of between $15 million and $20 million from their slots business in the 1920s.\nthumb|On July 25, 1931, the Los Angeles Evening Record published a copy of a letter from Bob Gans to a once and future Los Angeles police officer, which the Record considered to be suggestive of corrupt cooperation between local gambling rackets and the LAPD\nIn 1928 bootlegger and pimp Albert Marco was convicted of assault and sent to San Quentin, and boss Charlie Crawford, the Gray Wolf, was killed in 1931. The Gans brothers had been associated with Crawford's City Hall Gang, but following Crawford's murder, Guy McAfee took over a great deal of the organized crime in the city, assisted by what was called the syndicate, which included Gans, political fixer Kent Parrot, Agua Caliente gambling commissioner and \"king of the bookies\" Zeke Caress, casino developer Tutor Scherer, club owner and bookmaker Farmer Page, attorney Charles Cradick, bookmaker Chuck Addison, and rum runner turned gambling-ship operator Tony Cornero. Organized crime run by the likes of Marco and Crawford under Los Angeles mayor George E. Cryer was \"no cheap-change operation. It raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. But under McAfee and Gans, illegal gambling, prostitution, and drug revenue amounted to as much as $50 million a year\". As for unorganized crime, there was a stickup at Gans' downtown \"novelty shop\" in 1932 in which robbers made off with roughly  in cash. According to an International News Service account of the holdup, the office was staffed by 15 collectors and two \"girl stenographers,\" and the $2,000 carried off was in \"half dollars, quarters, and nickels, taken from the slot machines by the collectors\". Gans' machines reportedly operated unmolested throughout most of the 1930s under the protection of Joe Shaw, brother of Los Angeles mayor Frank Shaw. According to one history, \"To Joe Shaw, vice was a legitimate business subject to the same demands for contributions to the mayor's campaign coffers as City Hall employees and friends and acquaintances seeking city jobs.\" So long as Gans and associates kept cash for City Hall leadership as a line item in their budgets, they would have free rein to run their businesses as they saw fit. In 1933, the Los Angeles Evening Citizen News editorial page stated, \"BOB GANS, slot machine boss who boasts that his contributions to campaign funds enables him to control the police department, the Sheriff's office, and the District Attorney's office has pulled his unlawful robbing slot machines out of Hollywood. Chief of Police Davis says that the slot machines will be driven out of the city. Sheriff Biscailuz says that the slot machines that pay in tokens will remain in the county territory to rob the youth of the city, but that he will drive out those that pay in coins. We cannot follow the Sheriff's logic. We recognize of course the importance of campaign contributions.\"\n\nthumb|\"Slot Machines Run Despite 'Cleanup'\" Los Angeles Evening Citizen News, March 27, 1937\nDespite whatever change prompted the Citizen News to declare a battle won, not much changed as the Great Depression slogged on. Two years later a column in the Eastside Journal described widespread gambling and prostitution: \"SOMETHING MUST be done about the prevailing vice conditions in the city of Los Angeles. Beer gardens are serving hard liquors to youngsters and providing a place for street-walkers to conveniently meet their 'customers'...Slot machines, gambling lay-outs, punch boards, and marble machines are apparent throughout the city. An article in a local daily paper recently stated that these various machines, are making nearly $100 million a year for the operators. Merchants have been known to brag that their gambling devices show a greater profit than their legitimate business.\" In 1935 an informant told the county grand jury that local gambling establishments were well-known to city police (including chief James E. Davis), and that \"Open gambling flourished...and proprietors of clubs were tipped off in advance of raids, so that when the raiders arrived the gambling equipment had been put away and there was only dancing and dining.\" Charles Gans testified at the same time that there had not been any slot machines running in Los Angeles for the past year; deputy district attorney Grant Cooper told the jury that former slot-machine operators were now in the \"pin-and-marble game\" business. In 1936, Gans reportedly donated $27,000 to the gubernatorial campaign of Buron Fitts. Gans was the second listed, after Guy McAfee, of 27 \"vice chiefs\" identified in a 1937 grand jury report on organized crime, along with Wade Buckwald, Sam Temple, Chuck Addison, Nola Hahn, George Goldie, Eddie Nealius, Joe Botch Davis, Andy Foley, the Curland brothers (Harry Curland and Bill Curland), the \"Page boys\" (that is, Farmer Page, Ross Page, and Stanley Page), Slim Gordon, Dennie Chapman, Doc Kehoe, Doc Daugherty, Joe Hall, Tutor Scherer, Teddy Crawford, Dick Elgin, Louie Barddeson, Floyd Odin, Rice Baker, \"Ex-Bail Bond Murray,\" High Goldbaum, Dick Consadine, and Lucius Lomax.\n\nOn the last day of 1938, following the epochal 1938 Los Angeles mayoral recall election that removed Frank L. Shaw and put Fletcher Bowron in L.A. City Hall, a police raid on a warehouse on South San Pedro Street found 1,200 slot machines bearing the label J. J. Gans & Bro., which was believed to be \"the first time an action of this magnitude\" had been taken against the \"erstwhile impregnable\" Gans outfit. An LAPD officer testified in 1939 that he was offered a bribe to protect certain slot machines and similar games under the control of a group called CAMOA, which had extensive offices in the Subway Terminal Building downtown. The officer told a jury details of the local slot-machine business such as that \"CAMOA machines had a label which was changed each month. During April and May this was a blue bird...Kendall told me he would pay me from 50 to 65 cents a week per machine to take care\" of the 200 to 300 slot machines in the Hollywood area. At the same trial, the person accused of offering the bribe claimed, \"The gamblers and the marble-machine operators and prostitution interests are using [Clifford Clinton's municipal anti-corruption group CIVIC] to turn the heat on each other...One gambler will call up the Police Department and say he is from Clinton's C.I.V.I.C and demand they arrest a rival. The next day the rival will call up end report the other gambling place. Both the LAMOA marble association and the CAMOA group do the same thing with each other, and they all fight [over] the slot machines\".\n\n Later career \nthumb|Gans (center), at age 50, pictured with his lawyers, Isaac Pacht (left) and Hiram E. Casey (right), at a hearing about the bankruptcy claim of former Los Angeles police commissioner Harry E. Munson (Los Angeles Times, March 10, 1938)\nthumb|\"Police Find 1500 Slot Machines on Mystery Tip\" Illustrated Daily News, Dec. 31, 1938\nGans allegedly retired from slot machines in about 1938 (after Earl Kynette bombed Harry J. Raymond), handing the reins of the racket over to Curley Robinson. Perhaps not coincidentally, Los Angeles City Proposition No. 3, passed by popular vote in December 1939, banned \"pin-ball games, marble boards, scoop claws, and similar devices\". Prior to the passage of the proposition, there were roughly 3,000 slot machines in Los Angeles in 1939 that were under the control of CAMOA, the California Amusement Machine Operators Association. The racket was that anyone who wanted to or who was forced to operate slot machines in the city had to pay a certain fee per machine per month to CAMOA. CAMOA then used some of this money to pay city police and county sheriffs to overlook their slot machines or give them advance notice that a vice raid was coming, as well as paying the cops to enforce anti-gambling statutes against anyone who was running slot machines who wasn't a dues-paying member of CAMOA. In 1940, three members of a local gaming firm were arrested on charges of income-tax evasion, which resulted in a courtroom disclosure hinting at Gans' business practices: \"Faint rumbles were heard yesterday of a slot-machine war in which Morris and Frank Kozinsky and their sister, Nettie K. Segal, allegedly tried to muscle in on territory which Bob Gans claimed as his own. The Kozinskys were said to have harvested hundreds of thousands of dollars and everything was going along in great shape, until Gans became irked. As a result, said investigators for the internal revenue department, the Kozinsky machines were knocked over repeatedly but they refused to weaken and the war was going full tilt when the pinball machines were kayoed by vote of the citizenry\". Police testimony in 1939 asserted that that analysis of one Los Angeles slot machine, which had been confiscated in a raid on a Scheffler brothers warehouse at 1823 South Hope Street, found that \"the take for the slot-machine owners is about 30 percent. There is but one chance in 1000 to win a jackpot, and for every dollar invested by a player the return is about 66 cents.\" As Bowron oversaw a drastic LAPD house cleaning in 1939, he told reporters asking about personnel changes: \"No one is satisfied with the department except Bob Gans, Charley Craddick, and Chuck Addison\". \n\nthumb|Slot machines on the Bunker Hill, a gambling ship operated by Tony Cornero off the coast of Los Angeles, 1946 \nGans reportedly stayed active in politics after his retirement from business, funding candidates he favored from a fortune estimated to be between $15,000,000 and . LAPD Sgt. Charles Stoker's 1951 exposé Thicker 'N Thieves described Gans as \"conniving,\" and claimed that Guy McAfee and Gans gave orders to three lower-level figures: James Francis Utley, Anne \"the Black Widow\" Forrester, and Anthony Stralla, aka Tony Cornero. An article in the journal California History asserts that Gans was poorly understood by Los Angeles municipal reformers of the Shuler–Clinton ilk, arguing, \"A similar distortion exists in the reformers' concept of the underworld. They claimed that Guy McAfee was the 'Capone of L.A.,' and that Bob Gans was the 'Slot-Machine King,' but even the Municipal League admitted that both Gans and McAfee were bailbondsmen who engaged in other unethical, but not illegal, activities. McAfee, a former vice officer, was reputed to be both a big-time gambler and a wealthy philanthropist who resided in the fashionable Biltmore Hotel. A similar paradox surrounded the reputation of Bob Gans. While it was true that Gans was the president of a gambling syndicate, the California Amusement Machine Operators Association (CAMOA), it was equally true that he was an active member of the Jewish community and sat on the Executive Committee of the Mount Sinai Hospital. When placed in this light, the Gans McAfee underworld hardly appears as far 'under' as the reformers claimed; and if they contributed $15,000 to [Frank L.] Shaw's campaign it certainly was not a sign of malfeasance.\" However, another California History article points out that the grand jury investigating possible corruption in the Shaw administration was never able to find \"McAfee and Bob Gans, kingpins of the Los Angeles gambling world, who were believed to have fled the city to avoid the jury's subpoenas\". A 1949 report from a special California state commission on organized crime did not specifically refer to Gans but described the slot-machine industry generally as a font of untraceable cash that was protected by larger criminal enterprises:\n\nThe commission opposed licenses for slot machines in part because \"Viciousness is inherent in the psychology of something-for-nothing upon which the slot machine is based, and it is inherent in the character of the people who operate and control the racket\". The 1949 commission, created by California governor Earl Warren, suspected that annual gross revenue for slot machines nationwide was in the vicinity of . \n\nIn 1955, when unidentified gunmen shot up the home of \"Bingo King\" Max Kleiger in Pacific Palisades, the Los Angeles Mirror reported, \"The beach front gambler's name popped up in Kefauver committee testimony here a few years ago in connection with an alleged plot to recall then Mayor Bowron so that open gambling could run in the city. The committee reportedly received evidence of a meeting of five powerful syndicate figures in a Hollywood hotel room.\" The five people in the meeting were reportedly Gans, Kleiger, Jimmy \"the Eel\" Utley, Curley Robinson, and Sammy Rummel. Kleiger was known as a bookie, Utley \"concentrated on bingo and abortion,\" and Sam Rummel was Mickey Cohen's lawyer.\nthumb|Left to right are Robert J. Gans, Mrs. Benny Whitman, Jerry Giesler, and May Mann at the Ben Whitman Memorial Cancer Foundation dinner at the Ambassador Hotel, April 12, 1950\nIn or before 1937, Gans joined the board of what was then called the Mt. Sinai Home for Chronic Invalids in the Boyle Heights neighborhood. He eventually served as the president of the board for eight consecutive terms, oversaw Mt. Sinai's merge with the Los Angeles Sanitorium, and was honored for his service in 1955 with a banquet in the Embassy Room at the Ambassador Hotel that featured entertainers Jeanette MacDonald, Bob Crosby, Dick Contino, and Belle Baker. Gans' community leadership was said to be the result of the good influence of his wife, Effie Wise Gans. When Effie Gans died in 1951, she left substantial bequests to several charities from her personal estate valued at half a million dollars.\n\nBob Gans died of a myocardial infarction in Los Angeles, California in 1959 and was interred at Beth Olam Mausoleum. He was described in one obituary as a \"political figure of the 1930s\". Another obituary described Mt. Sinai as \"virtually a monument\" to Gans, \"a former prominent gambling figure\".\n\n Personal life and family \nGans was born in Manhattan, the youngest of six children born to Joseph and Henrietta (Goldsmith) Gans. His mother was a native New Yorker, and his father was an immigrant from Germany. Bob's mother died when he was six years old. He grew up and finished high school in New York City where his father and older brothers ran a tobacco shop. In the 1890s, some of the brothers moved out to the west coast, led by J. J. Gans. At age 24, in June 1909, Robert J. Gans, a cigar dealer from Los Angeles, married Effie Wise, daughter of attorney Benjamin Wise and his wife Addie Hyams Wise, in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1910 the couple lived in a rental house on Burlington Street near Shatto Street and Sixth Street in downtown Los Angeles, and Bob Gans was employed at a wholesale cigar business. Bob and Effie's only child, Clifford R. Gans, was born in June 1911. Gans' draft-registration card for World War I stated that he was not in town as of June 1917; that he was self-employed in the wholesale cigar business; that he was solely responsible for his wife, six-year-old son, and an aunt; and that he was tall and slender, with black hair and black eyes, with no missing appendages. In 1917, the family lived on Dorchester Avenue in Los Angeles. By 1920 the family, in company with Gans' brother-in-law, lived on Van Ness Avenue near what is now Wilton Historic District. They had a mortgage on the house, and Gans' work was owner-manager of a wholesale cigar store.\nthumb|Prosecutors Buron Fitts and Mabel Walker Willebrandt were troubling L.A. slot-machine businesses in the late 1920s, but Gans later made large contributions supporting  Fitts' re-election \nBy 1930, the family had moved to the home on Las Palmas Avenue that would be Gans' residence for the remainder of his life. The home was valued at $32,500, the family owned a radio set, and they had a live-in maid. Gans' occupation was listed as \"executive,\" he worked in the \"wholesale novelties\" business, and 18-year-old Clifford Gans was in school. At the time of the 1940 census, Robert J. Gans's work was reported to be vice president of a plastics-manufacturing concern, and Cliff Gans, who had finished two years of college, was recorded as salesman working in the plastics industry. When Cliff Gans registered for the World War II draft, he was employed at Pacific Plastics and Manufacturing, headquartered on Carlton Way, and was described as  and  with a \"low hump on left side of back and & right shoulder definitely higher than left one\". Cliff R. Gans earned an associate producer credit on the 1947 film Backlash. In 1950, Robert Gans, age 63, and Clifford Gans, age 38, were both proprietors of a business in the wholesale hardware-manufacturing industry. \nthumb|Effie Gans, Los Angeles Evening Citizen News, September 15, 1951\nEffie Gans died of colon cancer in 1951, at the age of 64. In addition to supporting Mt. Sinai, Mr. and Mrs. Gans, as a couple, were involved with \"the Nathan Strauss Palestine Society, the City of Hope, the Los Angeles Jewish Community Council, and the Wilshire Boulevard Temple.\" Gans was described in a newspaper report as a philanthropist and clubwoman who left an estate valued at , in \"a will dated last Jan. 30. The document stated that all of her estate, consisting mostly of cash and securities, belonged to her separately. The will bequeathed a brother, Lawrence C. Wise, $2,000. Three-fourths of the remainder was left to her husband, Robert J. Gans, 440 N. Las Palmas Ave., some of the bequests being made outright and some under a trust fund. The remaining fourth was bequeathed to a son Clifford, likewise partially outright and partially in trust. It was provided further in the document that upon the death of the husband and the son the estate is to be distributed among the widow or the descendants of the son and the charitable organizations, Jewish Orphans Home of Southern California, Congregation B'nai B'rith, Junipero Serra Boys Club of the Catholic Welfare Bureau of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the YMCA of Los Angeles, and Mt. Sinai Hospital and Clinic, of which her husband is president.\"\n\nIn 1952, 41-year-old Cliff Gans had an office on the Sunset Strip and was said to be working as a television talent agent. He was reportedly in the midst of moving out of the family home on Las Palmas Avenue and into a new place in Beverly Hills. As part of what was apparently his normal course of business on a Monday afternoon he had  in cash in a safe in his office, and was robbed of it by a stickup man who talked his way in the building by citing a connection with a former business associate of the Gans family. Cliff Gans told the investigating sheriff's deputy that he had that much cash on hand because he was moving money between banks. The names Clifford Gans and Samuel \"Curley\" Robinson were associated in testimony recorded in Los Angeles 1958 before the California state subcommittee on rackets. \n\nthumb|Several individuals who were named as associates of Gans in the grand jury minority report of 1937 and later histories of the era went on to co-found the Pioneer Club and Golden Nugget casinos in Las Vegas, Nevada, where gambling had been legal since 1931; Vegas Vic photographed 1972\nWhen Bob Gans died in 1959, he was interred beside Effie in a mausoleum at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. In October 1959, a month after his father's death, Cliff Gans married, in Clark County, Nevada, a woman named Sue Jean Millstone, stage name Suzanne LeRoy. Sue Jean, from Missouri and California, was variously described as a dancer and a \"blonde showgirl,\" who was  and was characterized by a male newspaper writer as presenting herself \"very high in the hair but low in the neckline\". A little less than two years later, the couple was in the middle of a messy divorce that made Los Angeles newspapers, in the columns of which Cliff Gans was described as the heir to a $1.5 million fortune left to him by his father, \"manufacturer and political figure\" Bob Gans. When the divorce was finalized, the judge granted former Mrs. Sue Gans the Bel-Air house that Cliff Gans had put in her name, but the judge declined to order alimony payments. The house, on Casiano Way on the Brentwood side of Bel-Air, reportedly had eight rooms and a swimming pool. In 1962, LeRoy reportedly had a penthouse apartment in New York and a chauffeur-driven white Lotus. She also claimed to own 12 mink coats. Suzanne LeRoy was living and performing as the Queen of Diamonds in 1963, at which time one of her colleagues in the \"undressed Latin Quarter chorus\" volunteered to a news columnist, \"Suzanne had a millionaire husband, and he wasn't any gem\". LeRoy remarried in 1964, to \"wealthy garment manufacturer\" Irving Alfasso. Alfasso was \"rumored to have ties to Vegas' Rat Pack entertainers\". The marriage did not endure, and the couple filed for divorce in 1965. As of 1969, Cliff Gans was doing publicity for the principality of Andorra, pitching the \"pearl of the Pyrenees\" as a travel destination. Cliff Gans died in 1983 and is buried near his parents.\n\n See also \n Los Angeles in the 1920s\n \n History of gambling in the United States\n Gambling in California\n\n References \n\n Sources \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  &  & \n \n \n \n\n Further reading \n \n \n\n External links \n \n \n\nCategory:1887 births\nCategory:1959 deaths\nCategory:20th-century American businesspeople\nCategory:20th-century American Jews\nCategory:American casino industry businesspeople\nCategory:Burials at Hollywood Forever Cemetery\nCategory:Businesspeople from Los Angeles\nCategory:Slot machine manufacturers",

From 6 September 1963 to 28 August 1965, he was a chaplain in Joure. Between 1968 and 1973, he was an advisor to the diocese of Groningen. He was a priest of the diocese of Groningen, but since becoming politically active in 1969, he no longer held any ecclesiastical office. In 1999, he openly clashed with the newly appointed bishop of Groningen, Wim Eijk, over his views on sexuality,Bisschop: \"Homo's kunnen niet liefhebben\", NRC Handelsblad, 18 August 1999. Archived on 5 November 2016. publicly coming out as a homosexual priest.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1977, he was the chairman of the provincial board of the Political Party of Radicals in Groningen. From 1977 to 1981, he was the national party chairman. In 1984, he was elected to the European Parliament for the Green Progressive Accord, a coalition of the PPR, the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN), and the Pacifist Socialist Party (PSP). It was agreed that the PPR candidate would step down halfway through the term in favor of the CPN candidate, Nel van Dijk. Verbeek left the European Parliament in 1986.\n\nIn 1989, Verbeek became the lead candidate for the Rainbow, a coalition of PPR, CPN, PSP, and the EVP, for the 1989 European Parliament election. Again, it was agreed that the PPR candidate would step down halfway through the term, this time in favor of the PSP candidate, John Hontelez. In 1991, Verbeek refused to do so, believing he still had work to do for organic farmers. The party board of GroenLinks (which included PSP, PPR, and CPN) wanted to expel him, but the party council refused to approve the expulsion. Verbeek remained a member of the European Parliament but operated independently of his party. In 1994, he left GroenLinks and became the lead candidate for The Greens in the 1994 European elections, but the party did not meet the electoral threshold.\n\nVerbeek authored many spiritual and political books, such as Tegen de tijdgeest and Liedboek Voor De Ziel.\n\nHe passed away on 1 February 2013.Obituary Herman Verbeek in Dagblad van het Noorden A posthumous autobiography was published.2013 - Toen daalde de duif.

        "content": "Parengyodontium album is a globally distributed fungal species known for breaking down plastics but also items of cultural heritage. Recent discoveries have revealed its presence in marine ecosystems, specifically in its ability to colonize and break down polyethylene (PE), the most abundant plastic in oceanic debris. Marine microbiologists from the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) and collaborators from various international institutions found that P. album, along with other marine microbes, lives in thin biofilms on plastic litter scattered across the ocean. The fungus is one of only a handful of marine fungi known to degrade plastic, a group that remains relatively small compared to the number of bacteria with similar capabilities.\n\nBreakdown of ocean plastics\n\nThe degradation of PE by Parengyodontium album is particularly notable because it occurs at a rate of about 0.05 percent per day under laboratory conditions, and this process is significantly influenced by sunlight. Researchers noted that the fungus only breaks down PE that has been exposed to UV light, indicating that in natural settings, P. album likely affects plastics floating near the ocean surface. While the fungus converts most of the carbon from PE into carbon dioxide, the environmental impact of this CO2 release is minimal, akin to the amount exhaled by humans during breathing. However, the potential for P. album and possibly other yet-to-be-discovered marine fungi to contribute to the degradation of plastics in deeper ocean layers remains an area ripe for further research, especially given the vast amounts of plastic waste that accumulate in the world's oceans each year.\n\nReferences",

The Sikaffy family had already owned La Voz de Centroamérica (HRVW) before, which by 1988 had a schedule limited to imports from the United States, Latin America and Spain. At the time, the channel was developing its news operation, when, at the time, the only news program was Hoy Mismo on Telesistema Hondureño.\n\nIn January 2009, shares of the channel were bought by the Mexican conglomerate TV Azteca, laying off eight staff members and evaluating the rest of the process in March.\n\nThe channel announced changes at the start of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, starting with an upgrade of its broadcasting equipment. After the World Cup ended the station presented a new newscast (Acción VTV) and announced further changes later in the year, without revealing them directly. By then, the channel was now owned by Albavisión. THe new owners relaunched the channel as VTV on 11 October, ending the use of the Vica brand after 25 years. The new schedule was a complete change from the previous one, aimed at attracting a larger audience share, \"starting from scratch\", and aiming to cover all of Honduras over-the-air without relying excessively on cable networks to deliver its signal. The Albavisión management helped increase the station's advertising finances.\n\nIn 2016, VTV by means of figurehead company Eldi was submitting 46 licenses for digital terrestrial television, which also included the licenses obtained by sister company Grupo G Telecomunicaciones.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Television in Honduras\nCategory:Spanish-language television stations\nCategory:Television channels and stations established in 1985",

        "content": "New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZNY) (radio communications: \"New York Center\") is one of 22 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs) operated by the United States Federal Aviation Administration. It is located on the grounds of Long Island MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma within the Town of Islip, in Suffolk County, on Long Island, in the state of New York. It is the busiest of all ARTCCs within the United States, and was the world's first en-route air traffic control facility.\n\n Overview \nThe primary responsibility of New York Center is the separation and sequencing of over-flights, arrivals, and departures within its jurisdictional boundaries in order to provide safe, orderly, and efficient flow of aircraft. It covers approximately  of the Northeastern United States, including parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania – and including the airspace over large portions of the New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas. Its oceanic control area also covers Bermuda. Most of the flights handled by New York Center are long distance flights flying at high altitudes and transiting the region.\n\nNew York Center lies adjacent to the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center, Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center, and Washington Air Route Traffic Control Centers.\n\nChicago Center is the fifth-busiest ARTCC in the United States. Between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2012, Chicago Center handled 2,343,281 aircraft operations.Federal Aviation Administration. (2013). Air Traffic Activity System (ATADS). Retrieved from http://aspm.faa.gov/opsnet/sys/Center.asp\n\n History \nThe New York ARTCC was established on January 11, 1956 in Hangar 11 at John F. Kennedy International Airport. In 1963, the New York ARTCC was moved into a new, purpose-built facility at Long Island MacArthur Airport, located in Ronkonkoma, in Suffolk County. It was the 19th standardized ARTCC building put into operation under the FAA's modernization program started in 1960.\n\nThe new facility was commissioned on July 21, 1963, and it was formally dedicated early that September. It was was designed to be able to withstand a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union and included the FAA's first real-time solid state computer used for air traffic control purposes; protection against a Soviet nuclear attack was, furthermore, one of the key reasons cited in favor of the facility's erection. The New York ARTCC facility was built at a cost of $15,000,000 (1963 USD).\n\nIn August 1981, many air traffic controllers picketed outside the New York ARTCC facility in support of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization labor union. The protests were in response to Ronald Regan's efforts in killing the PATCO labor union.\n\nIn 1999, the facility underwent an extensive modernization project. As part of the project, many of the facility's electronic & technological components – including display screens and computers, were replaced with more modern and efficient ones.\n\nOn March 17, 2001, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed closing & merging the existing New York Air Route Traffic Control Center and New York TRACON offices, moving them into a new, consolidated Long Island facility; these plans never went forward. Similar discussions continued over the years, with proposals for a new \"New York Integrated Control Facility\" being built within 150 miles of New York City – but in 2014, these plans, too, were ultimately called off.\n\nControllers at New York Center made direct communications with American Flight 11 and United Flight 175 on September 11, 2001, following the transfer of communications to ZNY from Boston Center. Several New York Center controllers who were on duty at the time of the hijackings aided the investigators and provided officials with their accounts of what went on during the events and what they heard through the air traffic communications. New York Center also helped the United States Military during the attacks.\n\nIn 2011, a scandal was uncovered, in which it was revealed that several controllers at New York ARTCC were distracted and not doing their jobs while on duty, and that many of the facility's officials were aware of the problem but chose not to do anything about it, despite the behavior nearly causing collisions of large commercial aircraft. Some workers had previously tried to rectify the issue but were threatened by some of their supervisors and other colleagues at the facility. This led to officials in Washington getting involved, and the management was subsequently overhauled.    \n\nIn March 2020, New York Center temporarily closed after a controller tested positive for COVID-19. The closure caused severe air traffic disruptions across the region, and resulted in all flights to and from the New York and Philadelphia area airports to be temporarily halted.\n\nIn the early 2020s, following COVID-19, New York Center was experiencing staffing shortages, leading to temporary limits on the number of flights able to operate within the airspace and leading to occasional delays & ground halts.\n\n 9/11 tape recording controversy \nIn 2004, New York ARTCC came under federal scrutiny after it was discovered that a tape made by air traffic controllers at the facility following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 was intentionally destroyed several months after it was made. Several controllers at the facility – including controllers who were directly dealing with two of the hijacked planes – made the recording in the facility's basement starting just before noon on September 11, 2001, in order to document and recall the events and their accounts of the events which had just unfolded; each controller spoke on the tape for between five and ten minutes. While a union agreement was reached, in which the tape would be destroyed after the controllers would provide the information through written statements, a quality assurance manager for the facility hand-destroyed the tape a few months after its creation, before a written transcript of the tape could be produced and before anyone could listen to it – and the officials at New York Center never told higher-up FAA officials of the tape recording's existence.\n\n References \n\n External links \n\n New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (FAA)\n\nCategory:Air traffic control centers\nCategory:Long Island MacArthur Airport\nCategory:Buildings and structures in Suffolk County, New York",

The burial site dates back to the Roman time and is located on a hill near Siuntio Church Village, approximately 370 meters northeast from Suitia Manor. The site is protected by law and forms a part of the Nationally significant archaeological sites in Finland.\n\nEkeberga Burial Site consists of a burial mound built of stone. The mound, 18 x 13 meters in size, is dated back to the younger Roman Iron Age. The burial mound itself has never been located by a former sea shore, and the landscape around it is very much the same as the landscape during the time when the mound was originally built. Due to post-glacial rebound coastal areas of Finland have slowly been rising out of the Baltic Sea causing the shoreline to move. Several items have been found from the site during archaeological excavations, such as burned bones, bronze and iron objects as well as glass pearls.\n\n References \n\nCategory:Siuntio\nCategory:Archaeological sites in Finland\nCategory:History of Uusimaa\nCategory:Burial monuments and structures in Finland\nCategory:Buildings and structures in Uusimaa\nCategory:Landmarks in Finland\nCategory:Iron Age Scandinavia",

        "content": "Luz Eugenia Cortés Rocha (June 28, 1950 – June 21, 2024), better known as Busi Cortés, was a Mexican filmmaker, screenwriter, documentarian and professor. Her work as a director and screenwriter had a significant impact on Mexican cinema, bringing in women's perspectives, particularly of women in Mexican politics.\n\nShe emerged as a filmmaker with 1988's El secreto de Romelia, which was the first film produced by the Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica under its Óperas Primas initiative, which supports debut feature films by young artists. Cortés would go on to teach at the CCC.\n\n Biography \nLuz Eugenia Cortés Rocha was born in Mexico City in 1950, to a family with roots in Guanajuato. She studied communications at the Universidad Iberoamericana, then enrolled in the Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica in 1977. While at the CCC, she directed the short films Las Buenromero (1978) and Un frágil retorno (1979), as well as the featurette Hotel Villa Goerne (1981).\n\nUnder her artistic name Busi Cortés, she went on to direct three narrative feature films, starting with El secreto de Romelia in 1988. The film, based on Rosario Castellanos' novel El viudo Román, won various national and international prizes. It was followed by Serpientes y escaleras (1991) and Las Buenrostro (2005), the latter of which was presented at the Morelia International Film Festival.\n\nThe director was also known for her documentaries, such as La séptima filmación (1973) and Déjalo ser (1992).\n\nCortés also directed various TV series such as El aula sin muros, medio siglo de tarea; Retos y respuestas; ABC Discapacidad; Santitos y santones; and Pasando el siglo en el cine, among others. In 2001, she won the José Revueltas Prize for Best Documentary for Paco Chávez (2005), co-directed with Francisco Chávez. In 2011, in partnership with the National Autonomous University of Mexico's Filmoteca, she produced the documentary short En trazos de vida. Son de Rina y Bustos. She also wrote a children's program, Rogelio y los rollos velados, in 2014.\n\nShe was a Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte grant recipient, a member of the Academia Mexicana de Artes y Ciencias Cinematográficas, and a member of the Union of Cinema Production Workers. A strong activist for women working in film, she co-founded and served as president of Mexico's Women in Film and Television Association. In 2018, she obtained a master's degree from the University of Guadalajara and Cineteca Nacional's film studies program, examining the impact of her own film El secreto de Romelia over the previous three decades. She also taught at the CCC, her alma mater.\n\nOn June 19, 2024, it was announced that Cortés would be awarded the Golden Ariel, the highest honor in the Mexican film industry. She died just two days later, at age 73.\n\n Filmografía \n\n Feature films \n\n 1988 - El secreto de Romelia.\n 1991 - Serpientes y escaleras.\n 2005 - Hijas de su madre: Las Buenrostro.\n\n Featurettes \n\n 1981 - Hotel Villa Goerne.\n 1983 - El lugar del corazón.\n\n Short films \n\n 1978 - Las Buenromero.\n 1979 - Un frágil retorno.\n 1997 - Unidos.\n\n Documentaries \n\n 1973 - La séptima filmación.\n 1992 - Déjalo ser.\n 2000 - Paco Chávez.\n 2010 - La escuela viva.\n 2011 - En trazos de vida.

As of 2019, he had never married or had children.\n\nAs a member of the People's Party (PP) from 1990 to 2018, he was a member of the city council and deputy mayor.

Vox entered the Assembly of Extremadura with five seats, which would allow it to form a majority government with the PP. Negotiations between the two parties stalled, allowing the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) to install its candidate for President of the Assembly, the role of speaker. PP leader María Guardiola went back on her word and formed a government with Vox, giving Gordillo's party control of the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nAs part of the coalition agreement, Gordillo was designated a seat in the Senate of Spain.

        "content": "Millard Preston Goodfellow, who often went by the name \"Preston Goodfellow,\" was an American soldier, spy, diplomat, journalist, war correspondent, and newspaper publisher. A veteran of World War I, Goodfellow became a leading figure at the Office of the Coordinator of Information and the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. Goodfellow was a publisher of the Brooklyn Eagle, Pocatello Tribune, and the New York American. During the Korean War, he acted as Special Adviser to President Syngman Rhee, mediating on behalf of the State Department and Defense Intelligence Agency between Rhee and Kim Koo. Goodfellow died in Washington, DC, in 1973, at age 81.\n\n Early life \nGoodfellow was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. At this time, Brooklyn was still a city, not yet a Borough of NYC. \n\n Journalist and newspaper publisher \nGoodfellow graduated New York University with a degree in journalism. He was a copy boy, reporter, and then city editor. Goodfellow worked at newspapers throughout New York City, including the Brooklyn Eagle. At The Brooklyn Times, he worked as a district reporter, rising to City editor.\n\nThe Brooklyn Times sent him to the Mexican border to be a War correspondent during the Mexican Border War, where he also wrote for the New York Times and Evening Mail.\n\nDuring World War I, Goodfellow served in the US Army Signal Corps as a 2nd Lieutenant. Later in the war, he was assigned to the office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (G-2).\n\nWhen WWI ended, Goodfellow retained his commission in the US Army Reserves.\n\nIn the interwar years, Goodfellow continued his rise in the journalism industry, returning to work at the Brooklyn Eagle as circulation director and then advertising manager. He moved to the New York American for a short while as assistant publisher. \n\nIn 1932, he returned to the Brooklyn Eagle, entering into a co-ownership of the newspaper and acquiring the title of Publisher. During this time, he was also the President and Director of the Brooklyn Publishing Company, the B.D.E. Broadcasting Company, and B.D.E. Properties Corporation, and the Tri-County Publishing Corporation.  \n\nOn 1 August 1938, after a workers' strike organized by the Newspaper Guild, Goodfellow sold his stake in the Brooklyn Eagle to Frank D. Schroth. He went on to form his own business, \"M.P. Goodfellow and Co.\"\n\n Early World War II and the intelligence community \n1941 Interwar Years\n\nIn the Summer of 1941, Goodfellow was recalled back into active service, now a Major in the US Army, he was reassigned to G-2 in Washington, DC. While stationed at G-2, Goodfellow encountered William Donovan, Wild Bill, who discussed with Goodfellow the idea of an entirely new civilian structure to be responsible for strategic operations, and Goodfellow approved. The two men were quick friends.\n\nReports conflict on when Goodfellow first met John Grombach, but by all accounts, Goodfellow thought very highly of him at this time.\n\nAt this time, Goodfellow was already responsible for the deployments of soldiers and marines to the Far East, North Africa, and Europe to monitor the unfolding situation of the Axis powers. Men that Goodfellow and his staff at G-2 were in strategic planning command of undercover deployments include;\n\n Robert Solberg to North Africa\n Lieutenant Colonel Warren J. Clear to the Far East and the Philippines (who narrowly escaped the Japanese invasion in a submarine, and had to recall his mission report from memory after his plane was shot down)\n David W. King\n Stafford Reid\n Kenneth Pendar\n Leland Rounds\nGoodfellow took a much more involved role in building Donovan's brainchild, the Office of the Coordinator of Information, and in September 1941, Goodfellow officially assumed Liaison status between Donovan and the G-2. \n\nIn October 1941, Goodfellow became the Director of the newly established Special Activities/Goodfellow (SA/G), replacing the duties of Robert Solberg at COI. Another unit called Special Activities/Bruce (SA/B), was led by David K.E. Bruce.\n\nUS enters World War Two\n\nIn December 1941 with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States officially entered the war, providing for Goodfellow and Donovan the opportunity to deploy uniformed soldiers, no longer having to rely entirely on undercover operations. Goodfellow, Bruce, and Donovan collaborated to create the first Operational Groups (OGs), which were special warfare guerrilla units, then still under the auspices of the structure of the COI. They selected Camp X, a training camp run by the Special Operations Executive (SOE), to be the site where these early operators would train.\n\nIn January 1942, Goodfellow was instrumental in negotiating with the National Park Service to dedicate swathes of land as three new training camps for members of SA/G and SA/B, and developing the training curriculum for OSS operators and officers. Primarily, Goodfellow used a team of War Department inspectors condemn the properties, and then approached NPS with a deal: OSS would only pay a dollar a year in lease, if they agreed to keep the place clean while they were occupying it. \n\nIn March 1942, Goodfellow recruited Garland H. Williams from the Narcotics Bureau as Director of Training.  Williams used his SOE training experience at Camp X to model his instructions after.\n\nOn 23 March 1942, Goodfellow was placed in charge of the newly activated COI Service Command, and a staff of 51 officers.\n\nGoodfellow created a mission that would be called Detachment 101, which was \"the first American unit ever assembled to conduct guerrilla warfare, espionage and sabotage behind enemy lines,\" and in April 1942, Donovan activated the unit. \n\n Radio stations and John Grombach \nGoodfellow and John \"Frenchy\" Grombach were good friends from New York before the war.  Goodfellow had been given a directive by Donovan to establish a communications network for COI.  Grombach was in the Radio business before the war, which gave him an intricate knowledge of the inner workings of radio station operations.   Goodfellow recruited Grombach into the COI to help him establish the network. \n\nGrombach was indispensable to Goodfellow in building this network.  Together, they built a radio intelligence program of collection, decryption, and analysis for the COI in Washington.  Later, they expanded to a larger center in New York.  Grombach established the Foreign Broadcast Quarterly (FBQ), which was the front alias for the communications center, and COI purchased NBC's Long Island radio station. \n\nDonovan grew distrustful of Grombach.  In one memo addressed to Goodfellow, Donovan wrote \"...do not use Grombach!\"  In another memo, Donovan wrote: \"I am disturbed by this talk of Grombach... It is clearly not evident to you, but I am told by all sides that he talks too much.\" \n\nIt was true that there were leaks of FBQ's operation within the government. \n\nDonovan had caught wind of three things: that Grombach was planning to build a Black Chamber in New York, that Grombach had married a woman without vetting her for security clearance before giving her an assistant director role in the FBQ, and that Grombach had already been recruited by Donovan's rival General George Strong and the State Department to help build a competing agency to COI within the Military Intelligence Service that would come to be called The Pond. \n\nDonovan had Grombach dismissed from COI in May 1942, beginning Grombach's spiral of hatred and distrust toward Donovan and the COI, but Goodfellow would still continue to occasionally use him as an undercover operative throughout the war. \n\nThe FBQ, however, was also dismantled in May when Donovan's rivals convinced President Roosevelt to order the COI to relinquish control over any communications efforts and propaganda. This abruptly forced the dissolution of the COI. \n\n Office of Strategic Services \nIn June 1942, the COI was restructured into the newly established Office of Strategic Services (OSS). SA/G became the Special Operations Branch (SO), with the staff being divided between Goodfellow and Lieutenant Colonel Ellery C. Huntington, Jr.  SA/B became the Secret Intelligence Branch.\n\nIn August 1942, Goodfellow officially left his duties at G-2, and transferred to COI, now finally able to dedicate all of his efforts into the new agency and Special Operations. Prior to this, he was simultaneously Chief of the Contact and Liaison Section of G-2, Director of SA/G, and G-2 liaison to OSS.\n\nAround this time, with Huntington being named as a Director of SO, the original staff of Goodfellow's SO and the staff of Huntington's SO formed what official reports called a \"bitter rivalry.\"  The rivalry between the two units persisted when Huntington was deployed to Europe. \n\nAt this point in the war, the OSS Assessment Unit had not yet been established, and recruiting for the organization was performed irrespective of assignment. Goodfellow was a prolific recruiter, but the exact number of persons he recruited into the agency is still unknown. \n\nMemos to Donovan that were declassified by the CIA in 2023 read: \n\nOfficers and operators recruited into OSS by Goodfellow at this time include; Captain Eifler, Captain Coughlin, Sergeant Vincent Curl, Lieutenant Robert Aitken, Capt. Archie Ghunming, Capt. Frank Devlin, Peers, \"Montana\" Chan, Phillip Houston, Harry Little, William Wilkinson, Floyd Frazee, David Tiliquist, Sergeant Irby E. Moree, Sergeant Charles F. Bruce, Sergeant Allen Richter, Sergeant John R. Murray, Sergeant George T. Hemming, Sergeant Jack C. Pamplin, Sergeant Skywon Chang, Sergeant Don Y. Eng, Sergeant Fimce Haimson, and Sergeant Chan Hong.\n\nIn December 1942, when the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued the 'Golden Directive,' it fundamentally reorganized the SO; it was no longer authorized to operate in the Western Hemisphere, and the OGs were to come under the direct control of Theatre Commanders while deployed. \n\nThe OGs were split away from the SO, and granted OSS Branch status under the newly established Operational Groups Command (OG).  *Note that the abbreviations \"OG\" and \"OGs\" refer to two different organisms: OGs were the Operational Groups that comprised the OG.*\n\nGoodfellow was advanced from Director SO to the position of Assistant Director for the entire OSS. \n\n Korean War years \nGoodfellow acted as Special Adviser to President Syngman Rhee. Goodfellow is the person who organized the former President's exile in the United States.\n\n References \n\n Archives research quick guide \n\n Millard Preston Goodfellow papers, Hoover Institution Library & Archives, Stanford University,https://digitalcollections.hoover.org/objects/65227/millard-preston-goodfellow-papers \n FOIA Reading Room, Central Intelligence Agency, search term \"Goodfellow,\" https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/\n Brooklyn Public Library Archives, enter search term \"Preston Goodfellow,\" https://discover.bklynlibrary.org/\n\nCategory:Office of Strategic Services\nCategory:Syngman Rhee\nCategory:World War I\nCategory:World War II\nCategory:Korean War\nCategory:Journalists\nCategory:1892 births\nCategory:1973 deaths",

        "content": "Robert Martel (5 March 1921 - 21 December 1997), nicknamed \"the Chouan of Mitidja\", was a French-Algerian farmer, counter-revolutionary French nationalist, founder member of the Union Française Nord-Africaine (UFNA) then leader of the extreme-right-wing political party the Mouvement populaire du 13-Mai (MP-13) following the [[May 1958 crisis in France|coup d'état of 13 May 1958]].\n\nMartel was born in Algiers. His family came from Brittany. He owned 300 hectares of vineyards in the Mitidja plain, in Chebli. He was known as an ultra, a monarchist, a passionate colonialist and Catholic, with nostalgia for the Vichy régime. A member of the poujadiste UDCA shopkeepers' union, in 1954 he joined the :fr:Groupe des sept(Group of Seven), a secret anti-independence alliance formed during the Algerian War between leaders of counter-revolutionary groups, poujadist personalities and revolutionary theorists. They infiltrated Gaullist activist :fr:Léon Delbecque's 'Vigilance Committee' with the aim of overthrowing the régime of the French Fourth Republic and placing power in the hands of the army under general Raoul Salan. Martel was also the leader of the Union française nord-africaine (French North-African Union) (UFNA).\n\nHe was one of the main organizers of the coup d'état: Opération Résurrection commenced with deputy Pierre Lagaillarde ramming the gate of the government building with a lorry before Martel and his supporters took over the building. The next day, Martel tried to have general Salan declared in charge but Delbecque persuaded Salan to finish his speech to the crowd with \"Vive de Gaulle!\" (\"Long live de Gaulle!\"). Despite this setback, Martel continued to protest against Gaullism. The new MP-13 party was formed in June by :fr:Lionel-Max Chassin. Martel became a member of the 'Safety Committee' of general Jacques Massu, who had temporary command over civil and military matters in Algeria, with Salan as chair. However, Martel then merged UFNA with MP-13 and took over the latter's leadership in September 1958 while tendering his resignation to Massu from his Committee.\n\nMartel took part in \"La semaine des barricades\", a week of protests in Algiers from January 24 1960 with about 20 000 demonstrators and reservists. He declared, \"With Deputy Pierre Lagaillarde, Maurice Crespin and farmers from the Mitidjia Plain, we are entrenched in the university. We will hold out till the end.\" The protests led to significantly increased fighting in the Algerian War with the formation of the Organisation armée secrète (OAS), an underground dissident paramilitary terrorist force of which Martel became a leader of the Constantinois district. An arrest order was issued for him and others and he went into hiding. In March 1961, he was sentenced to five years' prison in absentia for his part in the barricades. After three years, he was arrested in western France on January 21 1963 and sentenced to a further year for his protest and eighteen months for plotting against the state. His former alliances had not lasted and he claimed to disavow OAS methods. He was released in 1968, following that year's amnesty law. He retired to Poitiers. He died in Bain-de-Bretagne in 1997. \n\nReferences\n\nCategory:French far-right politicians\nCategory:1921 births\nCategory:1997 deaths\nCategory:French Fourth Republic\nCategory:French Fifth Republic\nCategory:Political parties of the French Fifth Republic\nCategory:Right-wing parties in France\nCategory:Algerian War\nCategory:Algerian nationalism",

        "content": "Don Easterling was a collegiate swim coach for North Carolina State University from 1971 through 1995 where he led the team to 17 Atlantic Coast Conference Titles, including twelve straight from 1971 through 1982.  He was honored as the Atlantic Conference Coach of the year four times, and was named the National Collegiate Scholastic Swimming Coach of the Year in 1993.\n\nA Texas native, Easterling was born in 1932.\"Colorful Banquet is Big Success\", The Wagoner Tribune, Wagoner, Oklahoma, 11 May 1954, pg. 1 Beginning his coaching career by the age of twenty, he coached the Fort Worth Panthers Boy's Club and the Burford Aquatic Club from 1952 through 1970.  In the summer of 1954, he married Marcia Boone in Fort Worth, Texas.\"Spinster Dinner Given in Honor of Miss Boone\", The Fort-Worth Star Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, 25 August 1954, pg. 9\n\nWhile coaching at the University of Texas Arlington from 1966 to 1970, he led the team to national prominence, capturing a second-place finish among teams at the NCAA nationals in 1969.\n\nNorth Carolina State\nAt North Carolina State, he inherited an exceptionally strong team from outstanding coach Willis Casey, who had mentored national, ACC, and Olympic champions during his twenty-five year tenure.  In Easterling's twenty-four years with the team from 1971 through 1995, he would continue Casey's winning legacy, and build on it, creating a lasting legacy of his own.\n\nHis North Carolina teams captured 12 continuous ACC championships from 1971 through 1982.  Demonstrating remarkable dominance, North Carolina had a perfect ACC conference championship win in 1972, where his team won each of 17 events, an accomplishment that has never been managed by another team. He was the first coach of the NC State Women's Swimming program in 1976, leading the team to ACC titles in 1979 and 1980. He earned an overall record of 329 wins and 128 losses in dual meets, accumulating a winning percentage of .720.  Easterling mentored a total of 40 All Americans during his time with North Carolina.\n \nEasterling retired from coaching the University of North Carolina in 1994 in mid-season, complaining of being “tired and worn out”, though he would later do some non-collegiate coaching.  He had recently had his 5th knee operation and suffered from back problems.  \n\nIn 2012 Easterling started a swim program in Charlottesville, Virginia at the ACAC fitness club, which five years later was renamed the E Team to honor Easterling and was registered with United States Masters Swimming. In 2017, under its new name, the team moved to the Piedmont Family YMCA and underwent considerable growth.  The program included prior high school and college swimmers, but eventually also catered to a few elite national competitors, triathletes and open water swimmers. The Piedmont YMCA Masters scored 14 first-place finishes at the 2017 Virginia Commonwealth Games Short Course Swimming Meet at Liberty University.The Daily Progress, Charlottesville, Virginia, 13 December 2017, pg. 14  He continued as a YMCA and Masters Swim Coach through 2022.\"Making a Splash\", The Daily Progress, Charlottesville, Virginia, 8 July 2022, pg. B2  Easterling did not retire from coaching the team until the Fall of 2022, when the team was merged with Cavalier Aquatics program. \n\nOutstanding swimmers\nHe coached a total of five Olympians, who captured seven medals, including three gold.\n\nIn 1968, while coaching U.T. Arlington, he had four swimmers make the finals of the U.S. Olympic Trials, where two of them, Doug Russell and Ronnie Mills, made the U.S. team.    Easterling had four of his swimmers qualify for the U.S. Olympic Trials, where they made it to the finals in 1968.  Ronnie Mills, and Douglas Russell performed well in the finals, and made the U.S. Olympic team.  Russell won two gold medals at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, with one in the 100-meter butterfly, and one in the 4x100-meter medley. Mills would become a 1968 100-meter backstroke Olympic bronze medalist.\n\nAn exceptional swimmer coached by Easterling during his time at North Carolina State was 1996 Atlanta 4x100-meter freestyle Olympic gold medalist David Fox, who was also an NCAA champion. Fox, who enjoyed the personal attention given to him and other swimmers, noted that Easterling, “constantly wrote and spoke to his athletes. He wrote small notes to each swimmer on their weekly practice logs\".  Two other Olympians coached at North Carolina State included Olympic 1976 200-meter butterfly Silver medalist and NCAA 200-yard butterfly champion Steve Gregg.  One of his most outstanding North Carolina State swimmers was 1976 200-meter backstroke Olympic bronze medalist Dan Harrigan who won a bronze medal in the 200-meter backstroke at the 1976 Montreal Olympics.  Easterling also coached Canadian Olympian Duncan Goodhew, who captured a gold in the 100m breaststroke, and a bronze in the 4x100m medley relay at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Goodhew later participated on Canada's bobsled team.\n\nEasterling died on the morning Saturday, April 23, 2023 at his home in the Charlottesville, Virginia area at the age of 90.  He had been suffering from pneumonia and COVID-19 for several weeks.\n\nHonors \nEasterling was a four-time Atlantic Coast Conference Coach of the Year, a 1993 National College Coach of Year, was inducted into both the Texas Swimming and Diving Hall of Fame and the North Carolina State University Sports Hall of Fame.  He was an American Swimming Coaches Association Hall of Fame inductee and was selected as one of the College Swimming Coaches Association's (CSCAA) 100 greatest coaches of the century.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1932 births\nCategory:North Carolina State University people\nCategory:NC State Wolfpack swimming and diving\nCategory:UT Arlington Mavericks coaches\nCategory:American swimming coaches\nCategory:20th-century American sportsmen\nCategory:21st-century American people\nCategory:College swimming coaches in the United States\nCategory:2023 deaths",

        "content": "Rádio 94FM was a Portuguese CHR-formatted local radio station broadcasting from the city of Leiria. It operated between 1985 and 12 July 2024, after which the station was bought by Observador becoming a relayer of Rádio Observador.\nHistory\nThe station's origins date back to the late summer period of 1985, when Joaquim Rodrigues, Agostinho Peçanha, Luís Perdigão, Mª Isabel Vicente and Victor Manuel Marques founded Rádio Comercial de Leiria. Like many local radio stations of the time, RCL was a pirate station, having been granted a regular license in 1989. The station promoted pop music in the 90s, in order to achieve a wider public, aside from its carriage of local and regional news.\n\nNew management took over the station in August 1997, adopting Rádio 9FM as its name, and changing the format. Accolades during the initial year of the reformat included competitions taking listeners to London, offering free convertible GTIs for a month and, for over a year, had the successful television presenter Jorge Gabriel as an announcer. These changes were fruitful for the station, as it became the most-heard local radio station in central Portugal according to Marktest.\n\nOn 27 April 2001, 94FM opened a subsidiary station in Cadaval, 94FM Oeste, on 94.2 FM. This station changed its physical headquarters in September 2004, carrying local programming and some relays from the head station in Leiria. With these two stations, 94FM consolidated its listener base in southern Leiria and parts of Santarém.\n\nWinds from Subtropical Storm Alpha knocked off its tower in September 2020, with the tower damaged beyond repair.\n\nThe station was acquired by Grupo Observador in June 2024, and at 3:57pm on 12 July 2024, ceased broadcasting definetly, being replaced by a relay of Rádio Observador from Lisbon. With the acquisition, Leiria lost its last local radio station. Rádio Observador's new frequency was the sixth overall.\nReferences\n\nCategory:Portuguese-language radio stations\nCategory:Radio stations in Portugal\nCategory:Radio stations established in 1985\nCategory:Radio stations disestablished in 2024\nCategory:1985 establishments in Portugal\nCategory:2024 disestablishments in Portugal",

        "content": "Про дивовижного чоловіка Гору (English: \"About the astonishing husband Horu\") is an Ukrainian fairy tale collected by folklorist  from a Transcarpathian Ukrainian source. It deals with the marriage between a human maiden and a husband in serpent guise.\n\nThe tale is related to the international cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom or The Search for the Lost Husband: a human maiden marries an animal that is a prince in disguise, breaks a taboo and loses him, and she has to seek him out.\n\n Source \nAccording to Petro Lintur, the tale was collected from an informant named Dilinko Ivan Gavrilovich.\n\n Summary \nA man has an estate and lends money to the tsar. One day, he tells his wife he will search for a son for themselves, so they can inherit the farm. The man wanders off a bit and finds a small snake on the ground which he bags and brings home. He drops the snake inside a small cup filled with milk. The snake keeps growing and he moves him to a large tub full of milk, and finally to a large barn.\n\nOne day, the snake son whistles and his father goes to check on him: the snake wishes to marry the tsar's daughter. The man goes to talk to the tsar and says his son is so tall he lives in a barn. The tsar takes the queen and the princess and accompany the man back to the barn: the monarch finds the large snake, but decides to go through with the wedding between the princess and the animal. The princess dances with the snake at the wedding, and tells the snake to devour her, but the snake bridegroom says she is his wife. The snake takes her with him to the end of the world, and the princess tells the snake to devour her, but again the snake tells her she is his wife, then gives her a ball to throw upwards. The princess does as instructed: the ball is tossed upwards then falls to the ground, turning into a large palace.\n\nThe snake then says the princess is to stay home while he goes fishing. As soon as he leaves, he takes off the snakeskin and becomes a silver-haired youth. He meets the princess, named Mariyka, and tries to come on to her, placing his hand on her, but she denies him, saying she is already married to Horu. The snake husband tests her fidelity again, the second time by removing his snakeskin and turning into a golden-haired youth. He appears as a stranger to her and again tries to seduce her, but she remains loyal to the snake husband and denies the stranger's advances. Lastly, he tests her a third time by becoming a diamond-haired youth. Once again, Mariyka denies the stranger's advances. The farce ending, he admits he is her husband. Mariyka does not believe it at first, until he enters the snakeskin and becomes the youths that appeared to her. He also tells her he knows she wishes to visit her parents, so he gives her a magic chair and a straw that can carry her back to her parents, but advises her not to listen to her mother, only to her father.\n\nMariyka sits on the chair and says to the straw to carry her back to her parents' palace. She tells them everything, and her mother advises her to heat up the oven and burn the snakeskin, but the king warns her not to do it, and let his curse end in its own time. Still, Mariyka returns to her husband's palace and, while he goes out to fish, she tosses the snakeskin in the fire. The snake husband smells the burning and returns to the palace. He admonishes his wife for listening to her mother's words, and curses his wife not to give birth to the twin boys she is carrying in her womb, until he touches two fingers on her, for she will have three iron hoops around her body. He then vanishes, taking the castle with her and abandoning her in the meadow.\n\nThe princess then begins a journey in search of her husband: she passes by the houses of the Sun and his mother (where she gets a silver hen with chicks), the Stars and their mother (where she gains a self-moving sliver), and the Moon and his mother (where she gains a pair of golden ducks). The Moon knows the location of Mariyka's husband, for he has been there, and gives her directions. Mariyka reaches her husband's new location, where he has taken another wife, a wicked queen. Mariyka stays by the steps of the castle spinning the sliver and interacting with the hen, the chicks and the birds. The queen's maidservants tell the queen, and she wishes to buy the object. Mariyka offers the golden sliver for a nght in Horu's chambers. The queen gives Horu's some wine so he falls asleep. Mariyka tries to wake him and begs for him to touch her, but he does not nudge.\n\nThe next morning, a servant named Popela, who has eyes in front and in the back of his head and lies on the castle stove, alerts Horu he saw something at night, but will only reveals if he is given a porridge with flour and some mare's milk. Popela then warns him not to drink anything the queen may give him, and only pretend to fall asleep. On the second night, Mariyka trades the hen and chicks and the golden ducks for a night in Horu's room. She begs him to touch her, he wakes up and touches her body, thus allowing her to give birth to their sons, a pair of golden twins. Horu then orders the queen to be drawn and quartered by horses, and he lives with Mariyka and their sons.\n\nAnalysis\n Tale type \nThe tale is classified in the East Slavic Folktale Classification () as type SUS 433B, , a woman gives birth to a crawfish who marries the princess; the princess burns his animal skin and has to seek him out; she trades expensive items to spend a night with her husband and he recognizes her.Barag, Lev. \"Сравнительный указатель сюжетов. Восточнославянская сказка\". Leningrad: НАУКА, 1979. p. 134. The East Slavic Index, last updated in 1979 by folklorist , registers variants of type SUS 433B only in Ukraine.Barag, Lev. \"Сравнительный указатель сюжетов. Восточнославянская сказка\". Leningrad: НАУКА, 1979. p. 134. In the same vein, in a 1958 study, professor  noted that the tale type 433B, \"The Crab Prince\", featured among types that were rare or inexistent in the Russian repertoire.\n\nHowever, in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index, the tale corresponds to type ATU 425A, \"The Animal (Monster) as Bridegroom\": the princess burns the husband's animal skin and she must seek him out, even paying a visit to the Sun, the Moon and the Wind and gaining their help.Vernaleken, Theodor. In the Land of Marvels: Folk-tales From Austria And Bohemia. London: W. S. Sonnenschein & co., 1884. pp. 359-360.Kovacs, Agnes. \"Az égig éro fa meséjének magyar redakcioi és samanisztikus motivumaik\" [Die ungarischen Redaktionen des Märchens vom Himmelhohen Baum (AaTh 468) und ihre schamanistischen Motive]. In: Ethnographia vol. 95, n°1 (1984). p. 23. The heroine is given marvellous objects on the way to her husband by the personifications of the elements, or by her helpers, and she uses them to bribe the false bride for a night with him. Only on the third night the heroine manages to talk to her husband and he recognizes her.Bamford, Karen. \"Quest for the Vanished Husband/Lover, Motifs H1385.4 and H1385.5\". In: Jane Garry and Hasan El-Shamy (eds.). Archetypes and Motifs in Folklore and Literature. A Handbook. Armonk / London: M.E. Sharpe, 2005. p. 254.\n\n Motifs \nAccording to Hans-Jörg Uther, the main feature of tale type ATU 425A is \"bribing the false bride for three nights with the husband\". In fact, when he developed his revision of Aarne-Thompson's system, Uther remarked that an \"essential\" trait of the tale type ATU 425A was the \"wife's quest and gifts\" and \"nights bought\".\n\n The snake husband \nSimilarly, in his work about animal symbolism in Slavic culture, Russian philologist  noted that the snake husband marries the heroine in East Slavic type SUS 433B, although the enchanted husband can appear as another type of animal, such as crawfish, frogs, toads, serpents and worms. Also, the snake itself is imbued with male symbolism, and is connected to phallic symbolism.\n\n Variants \n By Petro Lintur \nIn a Ukrainian tale collected by folklorist Petro Lintur from Khust with the title \"Жених-уж и невеста-лягушка\" (Ukrainian: \"Жених-вуж і наречена-жаба\"; English: \"The Bridegroom-Snake and the Bride-Frog\"),TYKHOVSKA Oksana. \"ЕТНОПСИХОЛОГІЧНА СПЕЦИФІКА ОБРАЗУ ПОВІТРУЛІ В УКРАЇНСЬКИХ КАЗКАХ ТА БУВАЛЬЩИНАХ\" [ETHNOPSYCHOLOGICAL SPECIFICS OF THE IMAGE OF POVITRULYA IN UKRAINIAN FAIRY TALES AND OLD STORIES].

UDK: 398.3(477.87):159.922.4; DOI https://doi.org/10.15407/nz2021.05.1273 (In Ukrainian) a boy begins to behave badly, and his widow mother curses him to become a reptile. He turns into a snake and creeps away to the mountains. Meanwhile, a local king becomes blind, and his only cure is water from a certain fountain. Each of this daughters goes to the fountain to fetch some water in a jug, but a mysterious voice scares the elder two away, while the youngest princess daringly takes some water. The voice tells her she will become the voice's bride, and the princess retorts: \"So be it\". The third princess brings the water to cure her father, and tells him about the voice. The king advises her to fulfill her promise. Thus, the princess wears a black dress and waits in her room for whoever was at the fountain. A snake slithers into her room, and asks her to turn off the light. She does; the snake takes off the snakeskin to become a golden-haired youth whose hair illuminates the whole room. The youth then asks the princess not to reveal the secret. The next morning, the princess's sisters mock her for having a mysterious husband, and she answers she has a handsome human husband. Later that day, the princess's sisters take the snakeskin and burn it in an oven. When the youth awakes, he cannot find the snakeskin, so he curses his wife not to give birth to any child until he places two fingers on her, then departs to a kingdom beyond the Black Sea. A year, a year and a half passes; the princess, heavily pregnant, wraps iron circles around her belly and begins a long quest. She passes by the hut of the First Wind and its father (who give her a golden hen with golden chicks), the Second Wind and its mother-in-law (who give her a golden yarn and a golden spindle), and the Third Wind and its father. The Third Wind returns from a journey around the world and tells the princess he saw her husband's second wife trying to wash a bloodied shirt in the kingdom beyond the Black Sea, and gives her a ball, advising her to reach the kingdom and trade the items with the woman. Following its orders, the princess reaches the kingdom beyond the Black Sea, and washes the bloodied shirt for her. The princess then trades the golden objects for three nights with her husband; for the first two nights, he lies asleep due to a sleeping draught, but she manages to wake him up on the third night. He wakes up and places his fingers on her; she gives birth to twin boys, one golden-haired, like the father, and another without golden hair. The tale then continues with the adventures of the golden-haired twin, who grows up and marries a frog that turns into a human princess.\"Сказки Верховины\". Ужгород: Закарпатское областное книжно-газетное издательство, 1963. pp. 236-241.\n\n By Mikola Z. Levchenko \nIn a Ukrainian tale from Podolia published by Ukrainian literary critic  with the title \"Як зачарований королевич-вуж засватав царівну\" (\"How the enchanted Prince-Snake wooed the Princess\"), an old woodcutter lives with his wife in the woods. One day, he goes out to gather firewood and brings home a snake. The man and his wife decide to adopt it as their son. Years later, the snake begins to talk and asks them to woo the princess for him as his bride. Despite the old couple's worries that no human woman will wish to marry a snake, they agree to it, and the old man goes to the king to propose on his son's behalf. The king agrees to the proposal, but sets a test for the snake: he should jump to the third store window and grab the princess's signet ring. The old man explains the test to the snake and he accomplishes the feat. The old man returns the ring to the king, who tosses it in the sea and orders the snake to find it. The snake also fulfills the task. The snake is brought on a plate to the princess, who cannot stop crying. Time passes, and the king invites his daughter and her husband to a feast at the palace. The princess cries over the possibility of taking a snake to a feast, but the snake takes off the snakeskin to become a human youth, locks it in a chest, and takes the princess to the castle. While her husband is dining with her father, she runs back home, opens up the chest, takes the snakeskin and burns it. The snake husband, in human form, follows his wife home and, seeing the burnt snakeskin, hits her on the nose, some drops of blood falling on his shirt. He proclaims they are no longer husband and wife, and vanishes. Later, the princess begins to search for him and meets three women on the road: one spinning threads of golden flax, another working on a golden reel, and the third taking a golden hen and its golden chicks to graze. The princess buys the golden objects from each of them by 100 coins each, and continues her journey until she reaches a river where some launderesses are trying to wash a bloodied shirt. The princess offers to wash it and cleans the droplets of blood. She then asks for a job as a goose-herder in the nearby castle. Some time later, she princess takes out the golden objects and bribes the mistress of the castle, the snake husband's new wife, to spend a night with the now human snake husband. The mistress of the castle agrees and lets her in, but she gives a sleeping potion to the man for the first two nights. On the third night, the princess pricks his skin with a needle and he wakes up. They reconcile, and the snake husband sends the mistress of the castle away.Левченко М. З. \"Казки й оповідання з Поділля: в записах 1850–1860\". вип. 1—2. Київ: друкарня Української Академії Наук, 1928. pp. 326-328.\n\n By Mikhailo G. Ivasyuk \nIn a Ukrainian tale collected by Ukrainian folklorist  with the title \"Чоловік-невидимка\" (\"Unseen Husband\" or \"Invisible Husband\"), a peasant man goes to the woods to fetch wood, but loses the trail and wanders off, so he stops to rest. In his sleep, he has a dream where a voice says the man's wife will give birth to a girl, and when she is seventeen years old, a golden-maned horse in a diamond saddle will come to take the girl to the voice as its bride. The man wakes up and returns home, and indeed a girl was born to his wife. The girl, named Maryka, grows up in the village until she is seventeen, when the horse in the diamond saddle appears, to fetch her to its master, just as the voice predicted. Maryka mounts on the horse and flies away to a beautiful palace beyond the mountains. She spends her days alone, but someone comes at night to her. They live like this for months, until one day she says she wishes to visit her family. The voice allows it, but warns her not to bring anything with her on the way back, since the horse will sense she is heavy and drop her off. Maryka visits her mother and grandmother and tells them about the unseen person at night, and they give her candles and matches. Maryka returns to the palace, despite the horse sensing her heaviness, and she goes to sleep with the voice. At night, on her bed, she lights the candles and sees a handsome youth beside her. The youth wakes up with a startle and admonishes her, saying Maryka will only find him again after she wears down an iron staff, iron shoes and an iron hoop around her belly. Suddenly, the girl finds herself outside the palace, and begins her long journey to find  him again. During her quest, she meets in the middle of a wide field Pyanitsa (Friday), who gives her a golden spinning wheel; then in a yellow desert Saturday, who gives her a golden self-moving loom, and lastly Sunday in the middle of a forest, who gives her a golden hen with chicks. Sunday also advises Maryka to follow the hen wherever it leads. Maryka follows Sunday's advice: the hen leads her to a willow tree. Maryka climbs the willow tree with the golden objects, the willow tree bends down to the other side of a river, and she finds herself in front of her husband's palace. Another woman was already there, and sees Maryka with the golden hen and its chicks, then says she wants it. Maryka trades her for a night with her husband, but the other woman places a \"dead cloth\" on him so he does not wake up. The next night, Maryka trades the golden spinning wheel, but her husband is also asleep. On the third and final night, she trades the self-moving loom, and a servant of her husband takes off the dead cloth from his body, which allows him to wake up and recognize Maryka. The other woman disappears, and Maryka gives birth to a son.\n\n By Volodymyr Hnatiuk \nIn an Ukrainian tale collected by ethnographer Volodymyr Hnatiuk from teller Mitra Palanchani with the title \"Чоловік-вуж\" (\"The Snake-Man\"), a husband and wife live together and pray to God to have a son. One day, when the woman is sweeping the house, a little reptile (\"га́дзік\", in the original) appears in the room and the woman tries to shoo it away, but the reptile calls her mother and asks to be welcomed. The reptile son grows up and wants to play with the other children, but they flee from him. He also goes to school and studies for three years. Later, he asks for a wife, and sets his sights on the tsar's daughter. He rides a rooster towards the tsar's palace and makes his proposal; the tsar asks his three daughters which one agrees to marry the reptile, and the youngest accepts. The youngest princess marries the reptile and, on the wedding night, discovers he becomes a handsome golden-haired youth when he removes the reptilian skin. He warns her to keep it a secret. Some time later, she visits her parents and tells them how her husband is handsome, and her mother advises her to burn the animal skin that night. That same night, the princess takes the skin and tries to toss it into a burning oven. However, her husband, in human form, stops her and curses her not to give birth to their child unless he places his hand on her belly. He takes his skin and departs to another land, where he takes shelter with another woman. Back to the princess, she cries for her lost husband, then asks the people where she can find a blacksmith from whom she can commission an iron hoop for her belly, since her unborn son is growing inside her belly and cannot be delivered yet. She keeps journeying for another year until she finds another blacksmith, where she commissions another iron hoop for her belly, and asks if he saw a golden-haired man (her husband). Still not finding him, she passes by a third blacksmith and asks for another hoop. The third blacksmith also tells her there is such a man that fits her description in a place just beyond the sea. The princess takes a boat and oars to the other margin, then reaches a village where she buys a bunch of golden sliver (\"кудзель\", in the original), a golden spindle (\"ўрецено\"), and a golden swift (\"мотовідло\", in the original). The princess sits on a bench with the golden apparatuses, and draws the attention of her husband's second wife, with whom he has been living in the village, and trades the golden objects for one night in his chambers, each object for each night. The first two nights, the princess tries to talk to him and begs him to touch her belly so she can give birth at last to their child, but he remains fast asleep for he drank an intoxicating drink. After the princess is brought out of his chambers, a servant tells the golde-haired man about the woman that has cried on him for the past two nights. He recognizes it is his first wife who has been trying to talk to him, but his traitorous second wife gave him a drink to hinder her attempts. The third night, the golden-haired man avoids drinking wine and pretends to be asleep, so that his first wife comes to his room to talk to him, after she has traded the swift for the last night. The princess cries all night for her husband, until he wakes up and places his hand on her belly, allowing the iron hoops to fall from her body and their child to be born: a pair of twin boys. An angel appears to them and gives each of them a golden apple. The second wife removes the princess and her children from the bedroom and shuts them out of the house and into the stables, where two hungry wild boars will devour them. The golden-haired man asks the woman where are his family, and she says they are outside. He brings them back, dresses his sons, then beheads the second wife, remaining with his first wife and sons. They all take the boat and return to his father's house, where they live for twenty years. The tale then continues with the family's adventures.\"Етноґрафічний збірник, видає етноґрафічна комісия Наукового Товариства імені Шевченка\". Тom XXIX: Етноґрафічні матеріали з Угорської Русі. Зібрав Володимир Гнатюк. Том V. Казки з Бачки. У Львові, 1910. pp. 246-252. Folklorist  translated the tale to German as Der Nattermensch (\"The Natter Man\"), and indexed it as type ATU 425A and partially type 433.\n\n By Michal Hiryak \nIn an Ukrainian tale collected by folklore researcher  from an Eastern Slovakian source with the title \"Проклятий син\" (\"The Cursed Son\"), a man marries a woman. Years into their marriage (one, two, five, even ten years), the man complains to his wife he wants a son, and berates her. One time, when she goes outside their house, she sees the children playing and prays to the Virgin Mary for a child of her own, even if it is a serpent (\"gad\"). Thus, she becomes pregnant and gives birth to a snake. She nurses the animal for three years. After he grows up, the snake asks his father to court one of the local tsar's three daughters, first the elder princess. The man goes to talk to the tsar, says his son, a snake, was born to his wife, and the tsar agrees to their marriage: he will keep them in the same room, and, if the snake does not devour the princess, they shall be considered married. The man goes back home and tells his son about it, then takes him to the tsar's castle. The reptile and the elder princess spend the night together: he lies his tail on her body, but she slaps it away. He then devours the elder princess. Some time later, he asks the middle princess for wife. Again, the tsar agrees to have them married, but fears that he will devour this one next, just as he did to the previous one. The reptile spends the night with the middle princess, touches her body with his tail, but she screams. He then devours the second princess. Lastly, he asks his father to bring the youngest princess as his wife. The reptile lies on her body and she holds his paws and caresses him. The third princess survives and marries the reptile. However, the reptile removes his reptilian skin at night and goes to sleep as human, then returns to his animal disguise, due to his mother's curse. The princess pays a visit to her parents and tells her mother about how handsome her husband is underneath the reptilian skin. The queen suggests they destroy the reptilian skin, so she will heat up the oven, while the princess goes to fetch her husband's skin. It happens thus and the princess's husband tries to recover the burning skin, but they hold him back. He feels his body burning, and the monarchs call for the doctors. After he recovers, he commissions an large iron hoop to be made, and places it around the princess's body. He tells her she will have their children, but she will not be able to bear him until he places his hands on her belly, she wears out some boots, holds a stump on her hand and bread falls from a bowl. He expels her from home and she wanders the world, the iron hoop hanging heavily on her body. After five years, she reaches a city where a good fortune-teller takes her in. The fortune-teller divines that her husband is there, and the princess will want to talk to him for one night, but he will be sleeping. She also gives the princess some silver thread, for her to trade for one night with her husband. The princess goes to the market and the passers-by sight the silver thread. The local queen also sees the newcomer and wishes to buy the thread, but the princess makes a deal: the thread for one night in the youth's quarters. A deal is made, and the princess tries to talk to her husband, narrating her arduous journey and begging him to touch her so she can give birth to their son. She fails on the first night, then returns to the fortune-teller, who gives her a golden thread, advising her to barter with the queen again. It happens thus, but the princess still cannot wake up her husband, for he is fast asleep. The third time, the fortune-teller tells her she foresaw this, and gives the princess a beautiful thread of diamond. The princess trades the last thread and enters her husband's quarters, again begging him to touch the iron hoops. He opens his eyes and extends his arms to touch her, releasing her from the hoop. He wakes up afraid, but sees that his wife, the princess, is there with him. His mother and the king also come to see him, and they live together.\"Українські народні казки Східної Словаччини\".

(In Ukrainian).\n\n Other tales \nIn a Transcarpathian Ukrainian tale titled \"Заклітий Василь і царівна Юліна\" (\"Cursed Vasil and princess Yulina\"), an old woman is washing her clothes in the river when a snake crawls towards her. She feels frightened at first, but the snake assuages her fears and asks her to adopt him. She takes the snake with him and they live like mother and son. Ten years later, the snake asks his mother to go to the king and ask for the princess's hand in marriage. The old woman goes to the king, who accepts the marriage proposal, but in turn she snake has to build a diamond bridge connecting the castle to the old woman's hut, pine trees alongside the road and a nest on each tree, so that the king is awakened by the cuckoo's cry. The old woman reports back to the snake, who fulfills the task overnight. The next morning, the king, seeing that the snake fulfilled his order and it is crawling on the road to his castle, tells his daughter, princess Yulina, to go with the animal. The snake guides Yulina through valleys and mountains until they reach an open field. Yulina lies down on the grass and, when she wakes up, she finds herself in a large court. She lives in this court with the snake inside a barrel, until one evening, a golden-haired youth appears to her. The youth explains he is Vasil, who was cursed by his mother to be a snake for the past ten years, and now, the time of the curse is almost over, and shows her the snakeskin. Some time later, Yulina tells Vasil she wants to visit her family; the snake gives her a magical chair that can transport her back, and advises her not to listen to her mother. Yulina goes back home; she tells her mother, the queen, about Vasil and his snakeskin, and she advises her to take it and burn it, but the king warns her against it. At any rate, Yulina returns to the snake's court and burns the snakeskin. Vasil sees her deed and can only lament, and tells her she will have to hurt her feet if she wants to look for him. The next morning, Vasil and the court have disappeared, and Yulina is all alone in the same open field. She wanders for three years, and still no sign of him, until she sights a raven. She questions the raven about her husband, and the raven tells her it saw her husband drying his tears behind nine mountains. Yulina asks the raven to take her beyond nine mountains, to her husband. The story explains Vasil was working for a witch for three years, and stops by a well to rest, when he sees Yulina coming to him. They return to her father's castle and celebrate a new wedding.\n\n Footnotes \n\n References \n\n See also \n Again, The Snake Bridegroom (Serbian tale)\n The Serpent Prince (Hungarian tale)\n Trandafiru\n The Enchanted Pig\n\nCategory:Slavic fairy tales\nCategory:Ukrainian folklore\n \nCategory:Fictional princes\nCategory:Fiction about shapeshifting\nCategory:Fictional reptiles\nCategory:ATU 400-459",

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadstairs_Lifeboat_Station",
        "content": "Broadstairs Lifeboat Station was rather unusual, as it never had a boathouse, although a building was provided by the Harbour Commissioners in which to store all the equipment. The lifeboat was  kept under a tarpaulin, and was stored on the pier at Broadstairs, a harbour town on the east coast of Kent.\n\nA lifeboat was first placed here in 1850, when one was presented to the town by former residents and lifeboat manufacturers Thomas and John White, now of Cowes.\n\nManagement of the station was taken over by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1868.\n\nBroadstairs lifeboat station was closed in 1912.\n\n History \nIn 1850, Thomas White and his son John, of Cowes, presented one of their Lamb and White type lifeboats to their former home town of Broadstairs. The boat was of the type they supplied to \nThe Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, non-self-righting, as Thomas preferred a more buoyant and stable craft. Thomas founded the boat building company J. Samuel White, which would come to be well known for the manufacture of lifeboats for the RNLI. He was descended from John White who had married Mary Culmer of Broadstairs in 1721, she from a family known for its boat-building, and one of the founding families of Broadstairs. This first boat would be named Mary White.\n\nThe lifeboat would first be called on the 6 March 1851 by the Walmer coastguard, to a brig wrecked on the Goodwin Sands in gale-force conditions. Arriving at the vessel, Coxswain Solomon Holborn and lifeboatman George Castle went aboard the vessel, and 7 of the 10 crewmen were helped to the lifeboat. At that point, the brig turned over, and the line parted, with the lifeboat swept away from the vessel. Holborn and Castle realised their situation, and jumped into the sea, but were soon rescued. The three remaining crew members of the vessel were lost. It may be that the lifeboat was named later, or maybe extraordinary coincidence, but the lost vessel, on her maiden voyage from Sunderland to Smyrna, (now Izmir), was named Mary White. Each of the 8 lifeboatmen was awarded the Silver Medal.\n\nIn 1853, Thomas and John White would present a second lifeboat to Broadstairs, the 30-foot Culmer White. Both the Culmer White and the Mary White would be involved in a remarkable rescue in 1857. At 3:00pm in a storm on 5 January, the 1000 ton American transatlantic vessel Northern Belle was in trouble, and dropped anchor off Kingsgate. The Broadstairs lifeboat Mary White was taken  overland, in case she was required. A crowd onshore watched the vessel, expecting her to be driven ashore. The lugger Victory of Margate with 12 crew made an attempt to reach the vessel, but was hit by an exceptional wave, and to the horror of all those watching, disappeared from view. All aboard were lost. The lugger Ocean then managed to get 5 men aboard to help save the Northern Belle. The following morning, the vessel had been driven onto the rocks, and 23 men could be seen lashed to the remaining rigging. The Mary White set out, and rescued 7 men. The Culmer White had also been transported to Kingsgate, and rescued a further 14 men. She then set out again, and recovered the last two men aboard, the Pilot and Captain. One lifeboatman, George Emptage, was aboard the Mary White, and then also made the two trips on the Culmer White. On the direction of American President Franklin Pierce, the 21 lifeboatmen from Broadstairs were awarded the United States Presidential Silver Medal For Lifesaving.\n\nthumb|left|Seafront with lifeboats, Broadstairs, Kent\n\nBy 1867, both lifeboats were found to be deteriorating, and the boatmen made a request of the RNLI to establish a station at Broadstairs, which was agreed. On April 1868, a 36-foot lifeboat constructed by Forrestt of Limehouse arrived in Broadstairs, provided from a gift by Mrs. Collins of London , and named Samuel Morrison Collins at a ceremony on 25 August in memory of her son, who had been lost at sea. To aid with launching the boat, a slipway was constructed from the side of the pier in 1869, costing £88-15-0d. Capt. James Elyard was appointed Honorary Secretary,and Jeremiah Walker was  Coxswain.\n\nIt was not uncommon for Capt. James Elyard to be one of the crew of the Broadstairs lifeboat, but even following promotion to Major, duties which required him to relinquish his role of Honorary Secretary, he still took an active part, and remained on the committee. The lifeboat launched to the aid of the schooner Lion of Goole on 12 March 1876, and managed to save the vessel and crew of four, bringing them to Dover harbour. For this, and 17 other services, which had resulted in saving 49 lives, Maj. James Elyard, of the 2nd Royal Surrey Militia, was awarded the RNLI Gold Medal.\n\nThe Samuel Morrison Collins provided exceptional service at Broadstairs, launched 84 times in her 20-years on station, and saving 129 lives. The boat was replaced in 1888 by the Christopher Waud, Bradford (ON 189), which would record 52 launches in just 8 years, and save 46 lives. When flares were seen off the shore at North Foreland, the lifeboat was launched, and found the brigantine Douse ashore on the rocks. Her six crewmen were rescued, and landed at Ramsgate.\n\nIn 1896, the Christopher Waud, Bradford was found to be suffering from rot, and was withdrawn. Reserve No.3 lifeboat, (ON 190), was placed on service for just one year, but in that time was launched 13 times, and saved 16 lives.\n\nA new boat was was sent to the station in 1897, built by Rutherford of Birkenhead. When completed, the boat was towed to Bristol in extremely poor conditions, and then transited the Avon canal to the River Thames and on to Broadstairs. On arrival on 15 March 1897, it was found to have been badly damaged on the journey, and was immediately returned to London, for repairs at Thames Ironworks, finally returning to station on 17 September 1897. Provided from the legacy of Miss Ivy Webster, of Exeter, the boat was named at her request,  the Francis Forbes Barton (ON 399). The Francis Forbes Barton would record 115 launches, and save 77 lives in the 15 years she was on service at Broadstairs.\n\nWith the decline in the number of sailing vessels, and with three lifeboats nearby, two at Margate, and one at Ramsgate, it was decided that there was sufficient cover for the area. Despite an exception service record, launching 269 times in a 62-year period, and saving 275 lives, Broadstairs Lifeboat Station\nwas closed on 18 July 1912. The Francis Forbes Barton (ON 399) would later serve at . The boat is currently stored at Ramsgate awaiting restoration (2024).\n\n Station honours \nThe following are awards made at Broadstairs\n\nRNLI Gold Medal\nMaj.

It was serialized online in Kadokawa Shoten's Shōnen Ace Plus from December 2018 to June 2020, and licensed in English by Yen Press. \n\nSynopsis\nThe series follows Marika Urūno, a normal girl living a normal life until she one day finds herself in a parallel reality where only women exist. While trying to find a way back to her own reality Marika enlists the help of her classmate Lily Kazami, and comes to learn about the differences in what people consider to be normal. \n\nPublication\nWritten and illustrated by Hiroki Haruse, The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me, was serialized serialized online in Kadokawa Shoten's Shōnen Ace Plus from December 26, 2018 to June 5, 2020. The series was collected in two tankōbon volumes.\n\nThe series was licensed for an English release in North America by Yen Press, who collected both volumes into a single omnibus.\n\nReception\nCartoon Cipher of Anime News Network gave The Whole of Humanity Has Gone Yuri Except for Me an overall  B− rating, praising Hiroki Haruse's art, though noting that \"while the artwork is gorgeous and the character interactions between the leads start out believable, the story is too loaded with ideas and revelations to really appreciate them.\" Erica Friedman of Yuricon gave the series an overall  7 out of 10, commenting that \"I would say that I enjoyed and eyerolled this self-contained 2-in-1 volume in equal measure. I’m ready for “being shocked at the concept of going out on a date” to drop out of manga for anyone over 12 or so, and, as this manga ran on Kadokawa’s Shounen Ace plus service, I’m willing to let it go here.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nCategory:Shōnen manga\nCategory:Yen Press titles\nCategory:Yuri (genre) anime and manga",

Originally an all-girl band, Riku Otsuka later joined as the bassist, transitioning the lineup to include both male and female members. The band's music has been described as blending shoegaze, pop-punk, and alternative rock influences, drawing inspiration from American and British bands.\n\n History \nthumb|left|Stereogirl performing in 2019.\nStereogirl was formed within a high school music club, featuring Anju Mohri on vocals and Kanako Yoshida on guitar. After experiencing their classmate Yuka Tachizaki's drumming, they decided to invite her to join the band. Tachizaki agreed on the condition that her friend, Riko \"Chamicot\" Usami, could join as well. Originally an all-girl band, Riku Otsuka later joined as the bassist after the original bassist quit. Otsuka was a fan and friend of the members before officially becoming part of the band.\n\nOn June 1, 2018, they released their debut mini-LP titled Baby, Bokura wa L.S.D., which was repeatedly sold out and restocked at record shops and online stores. On December 3, 2019, the band released the single \"Oyasumi Goodnight,\" their first to be released digitally on streaming services. They released their second mini-LP, NADA, on February 20, 2019.\n\nIn March 2020, the band was chosen by Tower Records as a recommended and top pick for the month of April, and on June 3, 2020, the band released their first album, \"Pink Fog,\" which included a remix of \"Oyasumi Goodnight.\" The release was postponed from April 15, and a planned release event in Tokyo was canceled. On February 16, 2022, they released their second album, Spirit & Opportunity, two years after their previous album, Pink Fog. On February 17, 2021, and March 17, they released the songs \"Scooter\" and \"Angel, Here We Come.\" These releases were their first new singles since the release of Pink Fog and were described as having an alternative rock vibe. In April, they held their first solo concert in Tokyo and Osaka to commemorate the release of their second album.\n\n Musical style and influences \nNext Music from Tokyo organizer Steven Tanaka described Stereogirl for the Vancouver Sun as having a \"shoegaze-tinged pop-punk sound\" that was influenced by American and British bands such as Pavement, The Smiths, and The Stone Roses. He added that they were \"writing incredibly catchy, heartfelt songs and are light years ahead of most bands in terms of stage presence.\" Ed Cunningham of the Tokyo Weekender stated that they combine \"punk rock simplicity with the melodic elements of indie rock, spun through a punch of thick, alt-rock layering and shoegaze-esque feedback.\" Author Ed Cunningham for The Glow described them as \"lay[ing] their influences on their sleeve, specializing in catchy, familiar few-chord indie anthems.\"\n\n Band members \n – vocals\n – guitar\n – guitar\n – bass\n – drums\n\n Discography \n Studio albums \n+ List of studio albums with chart positions Title Album details Peak chart positions (JP) Albums Indie AlbumsPink FogReleased: June 3, 2020\nLabel: Chigakushitsu Records\nFormat: CD, streaming989Spirit & OpportunityReleased: February 16, 2022\nLabel: Chigakushitsu Records\nFormat: CD, streaming——\n\n References ",

        "content": "Gold Rush is a steel family roller coaster located at Drayton Manor Resort in Staffordshire, England, UK. The coaster opened as apart of a strategic multimillion pound investment and the new Frontier Falls area, and features two different layout sequences in which the ride switches track routes.\n\nHistory\nDrayton Manor Resort was bought out from administration by European theme park operator Looping Group in August 2020, with the Bryan family – the park's longtime owners – staying on in key management roles. Tasked with revitalizing the park, Looping Group shifted its focus towards families; over the following years, new themed areas and attractions were brought in while a handful of thrill rides were phased out. Consequently, Pandemonium, an inverted swing ride, and Apocalypse, a  drop tower, were respectively retired at the end of the 2021 and 2022 seasons. Both attractions were explicitly removed to allow for future development; Looping Group CEO Laurent Bruloy first publicly referred to a \"very big project for 2024\" as early as March 2022.\n\nCrews began dismantling Apocalypse in November 2022, as its site was to be used for the next major project. Managing director Victoria Lynn hinted at a new \"family thrill roller coaster\" to take its place in January 2023. Teasers depicting roller coaster track subsequently appeared around the site's construction walls in June 2023. Drayton Manor Resort officially announced on 13 July 2023 that Liechtenstein-based Intamin would provide a \"Lift and Launch\" roller coaster for the 2024 season.\n\nFoundations for the coaster first began construction in September 2023. Ride supports were first seen onsite at this time, although track didn't arrive until November. Various part deliveries were initially labelled to be for a Spinning Coaster; management later clarified that this was not the case. RCS GmbH handled the installation of track and supports, which began in January 2024 and was completed the following month. Trains subsequently arrived on site in February and were quickly placed on the track.\n\nMarketing kicked in unusually late for the attraction. Frontier Falls was officially announced as the rethemed Wild West area of the park in March and opened on the 24th that month, featuring the transformed Blasting Barrels ride and Falls Theatre. Even as crews completed work around and began testing the attraction in May, no information or promotion was released on the coaster. Drayton Manor eventually announced Gold Rush as the name of the coaster on 3 July 2024, and it soon opened to the public on 26 July.\n\nRide experience\nQueue\nGuests walk through a tunnel adorned with posters for various merchants of the town and a switchback pen bear the launch shed barn. A path then navigates back through the ride area to the station, which is accessible through three flights of stairs. Theming around the attraction includes an old decoration once used on The Wave in 1994 and a tombstone to the former Apocalypse.\n\nOnride\nthumb|right|Visual chart of Gold Rush's roller coaster layout at Drayton Manor|400px\nDue to the nature of Gold Rush's switch track layouts, there are two different sequences available for the ride experience. Riders will always begin by depart the station facing forwards and ascend the lift hill. The first of two switch tracks will reset at this time, connecting another track to the lift hill as opposed to the station.\n\nIn the first mode, the train will fail to clear the lift hill and instead roll back into the forwards/reverse section, traveling backwards until reaching the barn and launch track. Filled with smoking barrels of dynamite, a voice warns riders to \"Get out while you can!\" before they're propelled forwards through the track and back to the lift hill. This time riders fully ascend and clear the lift hill; an elevated righthand turnaround leads to a drop underneath the lift, a rise into a descending lefthand turnaround, and another airtime hill. Riders turn into the second switch track, routing them back into the launch barn; the train is launched forwards through an s-bend and into the brake run. A final left-hand turn leads back to the station building.\n\nThe second mode is similar except for the sequence of the forwards and reverse sections. Here, riders will clear the lift hill first and follow that route to the launch shed; the switch track will then activate and riders will be propelled backwards through the other section of track. Riders partially ascend the lift hill in reverse before rolling down and forwards once again, traversing the same route back to the launch shed. Once again the train is launched forwards into the return journey to the brake run.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal Links\n \n \n\nCategory:Roller coasters in the United Kingdom",

        "title": "Norm Pattis",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Pattis",
        "content": "Norm Pattis is an American lawyer and former columnist who runs a law firm in New Haven, Connecticut. He is known for defending controversial clientele, including radio show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, January 6 rioters Joe Biggs and Zachary Rehl, and the murderer of Jennifer Dulos, Fotis Dulos. In 2023, Pattis' law license was suspended for six months in Connecticut in relation to a violation of a court order in the Alex Jones case, but the suspension was overturned in 2024.\n\n Career \n\n Fotis Dulos \nIn January 2020, Connecticut man Fotis Dulos was charged with murder and kidnapping in relation to the disappearance of his wife, Jennifer Dulos, on May 24, 2019. Fotis Dulos was represented by Pattis and Kevin Smith (a partner in Pattis' law firm), and payed them a $255,769 retainer. Pattis and Smith argued that Jennifer Dulos may have staged her disappearance to frame Fotis Dulos, comparing it to the plot of the novel Gone Girl. Fotis Dulos died on January 31, 2020, and the case was closed on March 3.\n\nDulos' mother, Gloria Farber, later sued Fotis Dulos' estate in a civil trial over the disappearance, and won. A $2 million civil judgement was given to the estate. The estate was unable to pay Farber as well as other creditors, so they, along with Jennifer Dulos' family, filed a lawsuit that claimed Pattis and Smith should not have received the $255,769 retainer because they only represented Fotis Dulos for 17 days before his death, and that the money should be returned Fotis Dulos' estate to help pay their creditors. In May 2021, the two sides settled, and agreed that Pattis and Smith would pay $137,500 in exchange for the two families' lawsuit being dropped and that Pattis and Smith could not discuss the disappearance case for the next four decades.\n\n Proud Boys members \nOn January 6, 2021, supporters of then-U.S. President Donald Trump stormed the United States Capitol to prevent the counting of Electoral College votes in the 2020 presidential election that would confirm Trump's opponent, Joe Biden, to be the next President. The attack began just before 1 p.m., when Trump finished speaking at Washington D.C.'s Ellipse park and his supporters who were listening started marching east towards the Capitol, including members of the Proud Boys militia group. Proud Boys organizer Joseph Biggs and chapter leader Zachary Rehl were put on trial for seditious conspiracy, and were represented by Pattis. Both men were convicted. \n\nIn August 2023, U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly sentenced Biggs to 17 years and Rehl to 15 years. Pattis argued that they were \"misguided patriots, not terrorists\", and that the Justice Department was overreaching in its prosecution at a level similar to the targeting of left-wing activists by the COINTELPRO program in the 1960s and 1970s. In October 2023, the Justice Department—headed by Attorney General Merrick Garland—appealed these convictions and two others which were much shorter than what prosecutors had recommended. Pattis called the appeals \"ridiculous\", and that Garland \"needs a new hobby horse\".\n\n Alex Jones \nIn September 2022, radio show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones went on trial for charges by 14 relatives of victims in the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut, as well as an Federal Bureau of Investgation (FBI) agent who responded to the shooting. They claimed Jones had used his radio broadcast, InfoWars, to defame and harass them by claiming they were actors taking part in a hoax created to promote gun control in the U.S. Pattis defended Jones, and the trial took place in Waterbury, Connecticut. In October 2022, a jury found Jones guilty. \n\nBefore the case, there was a court order to safeguard \"sensitive\" medical documents about the plaintiffs from the case's lawyers. In September 2022, Pattis sent the documents to the lawyers for two parents of Sandy Hook victims who won a judgment against Jones in a similar defamation case in Texas; Pattis was accused of violating the order by failing to safeguard the documents. The lead attorney for Jones called the day the parents' lawyers received the documents \"the worst day of my legal career\", and unsuccessfully attempted to remove the documents from them. Pattis refused to answer questions in a disciplinary hearing against him in Connecticut. The trial judge in the Connecticut case against Jones, Barbara Bellis, paused jury selection and gave both sides ten days to \"make arguments about the implications of Pattis refusing to answer questions\". In January 2023, Bellis suspended Pattis' law license for six months. Pattis filed a motion to delay imposing the suspension until his appeal can be heard, saying that it would compromise the cases of Jones and Biggs. In August 2023, Connecticut's Appellate Court challenged the suspension but denied Pattis' motion. In May 2024, the Appellate Court partially granted Pattis' motion.\n\n Rick Silverstein \nIn January 2024, Rick Silverstein, an attorney from New Haven, Connecticut, had his law license suspended for a year by Superior Court Judge Brian Fischer for \"abhorrent disciplinary conduct\". Silverstein had not been responding to overdraft fees, and Silverstein had a history of legal reprimands dating back to 2000. Pattis said it was a \"grotesque overreaction\", and tried to make a public interest appeal regarding the decision to the state Superior Court, but was unsuccessful.\n\n Personal life \nPattis used to have a column in the New Haven Register. His father was from Greece. Pattis is non-religious, and his wife is Jewish. In 2015, he wrote a book called The Trenches.\n\nIn a 2020 profile, the CT Insider referred to Pattis' usual choice of clientele by saying he is a \"Defender of the Despised\". They said his political beliefs evolved from \"liberal fighter for social justice to Trump voter and right-wing critic of political correctness and so-called 'woke' culture.\" In a 2024 opinion piece, Pattis said he was a libertarian who agreed with John Locke, and would not state if he was left- or right-wing. He criticized political violence, including the January 6 rioters and Donald Trump's threats towards Juan Merchan, the judge in Trump's trial for falsifying business records. He said that he was \"no fan of law enforcement\" but denounced violent threats against FBI officers.\n\nIn January 2019, the NAACP condemned a meme Pattis posted on Facebook as racist: \"an image of three white-hooded beer cans around a brown beer bottle hanging by the neck from a refrigerator rack\", captioned \"Ku Klux Coors\". Pattis then deleted his Facebook page, saying, \"the P.C. police disgust me\". The CT Post covered other Facebook and Twitter comments of Pattis which were controversial, about Rashida Tlaib, school shooting victims, and other people. He has defended his comments as being jokes. Attorney Leslie C. Levin told the Post that it was unlikely Pattis would be sanctioned by the American Bar Association (ABA) over his comments, because Connecticut had not adopted the ABA's specific wording about prohibiting discrimination by lawyers on the basis of identity.\n\n References \nCategory:Living people\nCategory:21st-century American lawyers\nCategory:American criminal defense lawyers\nCategory:Alex Jones\nCategory:People associated with the January 6 United States Capitol attack\nCategory:Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting\nCategory:Proud Boys",

        "content": "The Nkhamanga Kingdom was a pre-colonial kingdom located in the region of Malawi, specifically in the northern and central areas. The kingdom was established in the 18th century by the Chitumbuka people, a Bantu-speaking group.\n\n History \n\n Formation \nThe Tumbuka people originated from the Congo basin and settled in the area, where they became the leading residents. The group formed a kingdom and set up a ruling class with a king as the head. They lived in a compact area where each village was headed by one particular clan such as the Luhanga or Mkandawire clans. The Tumbuka community was recognized as a peaceful society without significant central authority or taxes. Instead, they showed their appreciation for their leaders through symbolic gestures, like offering leopard or lion skins as special tributes, reflecting their emphasis on community and mutual respect.https://allafrica.com/stories/202205180419.html\n\n Balowoka \nIn the late 18th century, a group of traders led by Kakalala Msawira Gondwe arrived in Nkhamanga from Nyamwezi, seeking to capitalize on the abundant elephant population and lucrative ivory trade. The region, known for its vast elephant herds, was dubbed \"elephant built.\" The traders, dubbed the Balowoka, meaning \"those who crossed the lake,\" had traversed Lake Malawi in dhows in 1750. They settled peacefully in the Henga valley, Hewe, and Nkhamanga, integrating into the local Tumbuka community without conflict or coercion.\n\n Creation of the kingdom \nThe Balowoka traders played a crucial role in the formation of the Nkhamanga State. There are two competing theories that attempt to explain how they managed to establish their political influence in the Tumbuka region. The first theory suggests that they leveraged their trading prowess to gain power, while the second theory proposes that they used military force to conquer and dominate the area. These two theories offer different perspectives on the Balowoka's rise to political authority.\n\n The trade theory \nThe trade theory suggests that Mlowoka, a wealthy trader, established the Nkhamanga State through his business ventures. He formed friendships with local chiefs, exchanging goods like clothes, beads, and hoes for ivory and leopard skins. By marrying into powerful families like the Luhanga and Kumwenda, Mlowoka solidified his ties to the region and strengthened his economic influence. When his father-in-law, Mubila Luhanga, passed away, Mlowoka's son, Gonapamuhanya, ascended to the throne, cementing the Balowoka's political power. However, some historians, like Leroy Vail, disagree with this theory, viewing Mlowoka as merely a merchant seeking fortune, rather than a political leader who established a kingdom.\n\n The invader theory \nHistorians Saulos Nyirenda and Cullen Young supported the theory that Mlowoka, a political leader, founded the Nkhamanga State. They argued that Mlowoka's marriages into the Luhanga and Kumwenda families enabled him to exert political influence, introducing administrative and coronation practices that fostered peace among the Tumbuka people. Mlowoka's military presence expanded the kingdom's reach, stretching from the South Rukuru River to Bisa country in the west and Lake Malawi in the east. When Mlowoka died, his son Gonapamuhanya inherited the throne, solidifying the Balowoka dynasty's grip on the region.\n\n Mlowoka's strategies \nMlowoka's strategic gift-giving and intermarriage with the Tumbuka families of Luhanga and Kumwenda earned him their support and acceptance as a relative. He gained the people's trust through fair and generous trade practices, respecting their customs and traditions. He showed reverence for their beliefs by paying annual tribute to the Mwadandambi shrine and honoring clan heads with symbolic turbans. By distributing valuable holes (likely a valuable resource for farming or craftsmanship), he won their admiration and was hailed as Chikulamayembe, meaning \"the distributor of holes.\n\n References \n\n \nCategory:Former British colonies and protectorates in Africa\nCategory:History of Malawi\nCategory:Monarchies of Malawi\nCategory:Former empires in Africa\nCategory:19th-century disestablishments in Africa",

        "content": "The Special Olympics World Winter Games 2029 are a planned international multi-sport event. It will be the 13th Special Olympics International Winter Games. They are scheduled to be held in March 2029, in the cantons of Graubünden and Zurich, Switzerland . The sporting part will be held entirely in the canton of Graubünden, and the opening ceremony is scheduled to take place in Zurich.\n\n Application, award and planning process \nThe application was prepared by  in partnership with seven public partners (Switzerland, the canton of Grisons, municipalities ofVaz/Obervaz and Arosa, and the cities Chur, Zürich and Zürich. The University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons was also involved in the preparation.\n\nOn 18 and 19 June 2021, Switzerland was awarded the event by the Special Olympics. The condition was that public funding had to be available by 30 September 2022; this was achieved. The contract was awarded at the same time as the 2025 Special Olympics World Winter Games was awarded to Turin.\n\nThe opening ceremony is to take place on March 6, 2029 in the Letzigrund Stadium in Zurich, with the closing ceremony in Chur supported by the Host Town Program throughout Switzerland. This offers sporting, cultural and entertainment activities, a social exchange with the local population and lived inclusion. For this purpose, the delegations will be assigned to the cantons in the days before the games according to possibilities; 23 of them will be guests in the twelve districts of the canton of Zurich and twelve districts of the city of Zurich, for example. For this purpose, each Host Town Committee will develop a concept based on free accommodation, food and transport for the international guests. The Canton of Zurich expects around 6,100 overnight stays for the Host Town Program and the opening ceremony, around 10,000 visitors for the opening ceremony and around 2,000 participants at the meetings, receptions and congresses.\n\nAround 2,500 athletes from 110 nations are expected to take part in the games. According to the funding decision, 650 coaches are also expected, making the World Games the second largest multi-sport event in the world after the Olympic Games.\n\nThe games are intended to enable universities and technical colleges to plan and carry out scientific projects on inclusion.\n\nThe Pre-Games are expected to take place in Chur from March 13 to 18, 2028. They are also the National Games of SOSWI and the test event for the WWG 2029. Over 800 athletes and coaches will take part in the sports planned for the WWG 2029 over six days. International delegations, primarily from Europe, are also expected. The competitions are to be held in the competition venues in Graubünden that are also planned for the World Games. In addition to the competitions, experience with accommodation and logistics is to be gained. The opening and closing ceremonies are to take place in Chur.\n\n Goals \nAn important goal is the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Switzerland. It is planned that the partners of the World Games - from the host cities to the sponsors and contractors - will set an example in a charter and begin with concrete measures, such as creating jobs in the primary labour market. Around 30 people are involved in the drafting of the charter. They are to form an inclusion advisory board that will have an advisory function, but also monitor compliance with the charter in the organization of the World Games. The charter is to be presented in 2023. As part of the candidacy for the Special Olympics World Winter Games 2029, a basic study was prepared to improve inclusion in sport, housing and the working world in Switzerland.\n\n Sports and venues \nThe following nine sports will be represented:\n\n Figure skating (Chur)\n Floor Hockey (Chur)\n Snowshoeing (Lenzerheide)\n Short Track (Chur)\n Alpine skiing (Arosa)\n Cross-country skiing (Lenzerheide)\n Snowboarding (Arosa)\n Dance sport (Lenzerheide)\n Indoor hockey (also called unihockey or floorball) (Chur)\n\n Organisation \nThe board of the organization responsible for holding the games is preparing to start its operational activities at the beginning of 2024. The full board is comprised of seven people: the president is Bruno Barth, the managing director of Special Olympics Switzerland. The office of vice president is held by the FDP politician and president of the World Games Association Urs Marti, who was very committed to awarding the games to Graubünden. He will remain in office as mayor of Chur until the end of 2024. The two board members Luana Bergamin and Stefan Frey come from the board of trustees of Special Olympics Switzerland. Lea Sandoz-Mey is committed to inclusion: as part of her high school diploma thesis , she founded the Inclusion 360 association shortly before the turn of the millennium and started a project in Zimbabwe in collaboration with the local Sunshine Project. The board also includes Hans-Willy Brockes, founder and managing director of the ESB Marketing Network with more than 550 partners. He is very well known and well connected in European sports sponsorship. By the end of 2023, one more person with cognitive impairment will be admitted to the Presidium.\n\nBeat Ritschard was appointed Secretary General.\n\n Financing \nThe total budget is 38 million Swiss francs. Around three quarters of this will be financed by public bodies.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, the two chambers of the Swiss Federal Assembly approved 28.6 million Swiss francs for major sporting events of international importance for the years 2025 to 2029, of which 9.5 million francs are earmarked for the Special Olympics World Winter Games 2029. The other public partners of Special Olympics Switzerland had already pledged 19.1 million Swiss francs for the games at an earlier date, subject to a positive decision by the Federal Assembly. Of this sum, 1.8 million francs will come from the canton of Zurich's charitable fund, formerly known as the lottery fund. In Chur, voters approved a loan of 4.25 million francs for the hosting of the games by 7026 votes to 4155. This corresponds to a yes vote share of 62.84 percent.\n\nThe public funding of the games is thus secured. As soon as the text of the vote is available, the formal commitment can be obtained from Special Olympics International and an implementation agreement can be drawn up.\n\n Public relations \n\n Logo \nThe logo is to be developed by the Nyon-based agency Twist by the end of 2023. Workshops for this began in 2023, with members of the Special Olympics Athletes Commission and employees of Twist's Studio Intégratif also participating.\n\n Sponsorships \nThe mountain biker Nino Schurter is an ambassador for the games. He is an Olympic champion (2016), ten-time world champion and eight-time winner of the UCI overall World Cup in cross country.\n\n Weblinks \n\n Interview with Bruno Barth about the Special Olympics World Winter Games 2029\n\n References \n\nCategory:Special Olympics World Games\nCategory:Sports competitions in Zürich\nCategory:2029 in sports\nCategory:2029 in multi-sport events\nCategory:Winter sports in Switzerland",

        "content": "Ram Seshadri is an American materials scientist, chemist and academic. He is the associate dean for research in the College of Engineering as well as distinguished professor in the Materials Department and the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and the Fred and Linda R. Wudl Professor of Materials Science at University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nSeshadri is known for his contributions to understanding the relationships between structure, composition, and properties in functional inorganic materials. His research also encompasses materials for energy conversion and storage, such as Li-ion and related battery materials, magnetocaloric materials, and hybrid halide optoelectronic materials. Furthermore, he is the recipient of 2004 National Science Foundation Career Award, and the 2005 Exxon Mobil Solid State Chemistry Faculty Fellowship of the American Chemical Society. Furthermore, he has published over 400 scientific research publications in leading academic journals.\n\nSeshadri has served on the editorial boards of numerous academic journals and is the editor of the journal Annual Review of Materials Research.\n\nAcademic background\nSeshadri completed his Bachelor's in Chemistry from St. Stephen's College at Delhi University in 1989. Later, he earned his M.S. in chemistry, followed by a Ph.D. under the supervision of professor C. N. R. Rao in Solid State Chemistry, from the Indian Institute of Science, in 1995.\n\nCareer\nSeshadri began his academic career in 1999 as an assistant professor in the Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit at the Indian Institute of Chemistry. From 2002 to 2006, he was an assistant professor in the Materials Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 2006, he was promoted to associate professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, serving until 2008. He then became a professor in the Materials Department and the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the same institution. Furthermore, he is a fellow of Royal Society of Chemistry, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Physical Society and the Neutron Scattering Society of America. Since 2020, he has served as a distinguished professor in the Materials Department and the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, as well as the associate dean for research in the College of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nResearch\nSeshadri research is multi-faceted. In 2013, he co-authored a paper on phosphor materials for solid-state white lighting, focusing on Ce3+ and Eu2+ doped materials, their excitation and reemission properties, and guidelines for developing new host materials. That same year, he worked with to optimize Ce3+ phosphors for high-brightness LEDs. They used the Debye temperature and band gap of host materials to assess structural rigidity and efficiency, proposing a sorting diagram for identifying suitable hosts and addressing related challenges. In 2014, Seshadri investigated the superior thermal stability and luminescence efficiency of intermediate compositions of SrxBa2–xSiO4+ phosphors. He attributed these properties to optimal cation bonding and lattice rigidity, based on experimental and theoretical analyses.\n\nSeshadri has also researched the behavior of compounds with lone pair ions and developed guidelines for determining when these lone pairs influence the crystal chemistry of the compounds. In 2003, he collaborated with others to us density functional theory to explore lone pair behavior and material instabilities in IV-VI chalcogenides, revealing that anion 𝑝 states played a significant role in lone pair localization and that these materials exhibited a balance between structural distortions and metallic tendencies, affecting their dielectric properties and phonon modes. Through his 2016 study, he examined how the lone pair electrons of Sn2+ in CsSnBr3 influenced its structural and optical properties, revealing temperature-dependent distortions and transitions between different crystal structures. Furthermore, in 2023, he examined how lone pairs of electrons influence the electronic structure and properties of crystalline solids, highlighting their role in various materials and their potential as a design element for tuning material functions.\n\nSeshadri has also conducted research on the rapid screening of magnetocaloric materials and photovoltaics, and has made significant contributions to the fields of frustrated magnetism and magnetoelectric multiferroics. In this regard, his 2014 study explored how Mn₃O₄ exhibited phase coexistence and lattice strain below 42 K due to magnetic ordering, with a nearly equal presence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. This study suggested that such phase coexistence might be common in other magnetic spinels at low temperatures. Later in 2017, Seshadri introduced a computational method to predict the magnetocaloric effect of materials using the magnetic deformation ΣM, which was validated experimentally and used to identify promising new compounds for magnetic refrigeration. More recently in 2019, he evaluated around 33,000 inorganic compounds for their potential as photovoltaic materials, identified about 200 high-performing candidates with promising efficiencies and carrier properties, and provided detailed data for further research.\n\nAwards and honors\n2004 – Career Award, National Science Foundation \n2005 – ExxonMobil Solid State Chemistry Faculty Fellowship, American Chemical Society\n2015 – Silver Medal, Chemical Research Society of India \n2018 – Silver Medal, Materials Research Society of India\n\nSelected articles\nSeshadri, R., & Hill, N.

        "content": "alt=A COMIBOL logo|thumb|An emblem at the COMIBOL building in La Paz\nThe Corporación Minera de Bolivia (Mining Corporation of Bolivia), also known as COMIBOL, is a major Bolivian state company that oversees the nation's mining operations. \n\nIn the decades after the Bolivian National Revolution, it became the country's largest and most important public company. After a period of inactivity following the 1985 Bolivian economic crisis, COMIBOL was revived in 2006 and today holds an important, if diminished, place in the country's economy.\n\n History \nCOMIBOL was created by Supreme Declaration 3196 on October 2, 1952.\n\nIt was founded ahead of the nationalization of the Patiño, Hochschild, and Aramayo mines on October 31 by the government of Víctor Paz Estenssoro, in the context of the Bolivian National Revolution. The businesses of the three nationalized mining groups were initially reorganized into 16 mining companies exploiting tin, lead, silver, zinc, tungsten, copper, and gold, with COMIBOL overseeing the administration of these operations.\n\nCOMIBOL was the principal Bolivian public company for many decades after its creation, being the country's main source of foreign currency and its biggest employer. It played an important role in the capitalization of YPFB from the 1950s to '70s. As of November 2014, COMIBOL was the country's third-largest public company based on revenue, after YPFB and the Empresa Metalúrgica de Vinto.\n\nThe history of COMIBOL is intimately linked to Bolivia's development process. Its foundations were the transfer to the state of 163 mines owned across 13 companies by the state's mining barons, Patiño, Hochschild, and Aramayo, which had a labor force of 29,000 people and a total production of 27,000 metric tons of tin.\nalt=A chart showing the proportional export values of COMIBOL (in yellow), small mining (in red), and mid-sized mining (in blue).|thumb|The proportional export values of COMIBOL (in yellow), small mining (in red), and mid-sized mining (in blue).\nDuring the Bolivian National Revolution, from 1952 to 1964, COMIBOL suffered from declining mineral content, a lack of reserves, a lack of administrative capacity, and an excess of workers. At the same time, the government used COMIBOL to generate cheap foreign currency and financial resources. For example, in 1956, COMIBOL contributed 30 million dollars to the  and 10 million to YPFB. It's estimated that during the government of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement in this period, COMIBOL transferred more than 100 million dollars to YPFB.\nalt=A mural at the COMIBOL archives |left|thumb|A mural at the COMIBOL archives\nThe relative importance of COMIBOL's export values was in permanent decline. Since Bolivia's 1985 economic crisis and the institution of Supreme Decree 21060, the value of of exports from small and mid-sized mining, as a percentage of the total value of exports, overtook that of COMIBOL. It became effectively paralyzed between 1986 and 2005, with its activities extremely limited.\n\nIn 2006, the company was reactivated and resumed its productive capacity, though at a lower level than before 1985. \n\nThe COMIBOL archives are housed at the Catavi mine.\n\n Companies \n\n Empresa Minera Huanuni\n Empresa Minera Colquiri\n Empresa Minera Corocoro\n Empresa Metalúrgica Vinto\n Empresa Metalúrgica de Karachipampa\n Empresa Boliviana del Oro\n Empresa Minera San Jose\n Dirección de Medio Ambiente - DIMA\n\nIn 2017, the Gerencia Nacional Recursos Evaporíticos was moved from under COMIBOL and the Ministry of Mining, coming under the purview of the Empresa Pública Nacional Estratégica de , which depends on the Ministry of Energy.\n\n Huanuni \nDue to its high mineral content, Huanuni was the only COMIBOL mine that did not close in 1985, after the tin market crisis and Supreme Decree 21060. It was exploited as a joint venture until 2006, when it was retaken by COMIBOL. \n\nA large part of the technology used in Huanuni is from the 1970s. Owing to the richness of its minerals, it is more mechanized than other mines in Bolivia. The government is constructing a new refinery in Dolores, near Huanuni, that should improve the efficiency and profitability of the Empresa Minera Huanuni. The high price of tin has increased interest in exploitation within the mine. Today, there are around 4,500 workers at Huanuni, including 2,000 on the surface. In 2006, competition over the riches veins almost led to a fight between cooperative miners and those employed by the state. In the end, the government opted to hired the cooperative workers as employees, increasing COMIBOL's payroll.\n\n References \n\nCategory:Government-owned companies of Bolivia",

        "title": "Punjabi dictionary",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_dictionary",
        "content": "Punjabi dictionaries are compilations of words and phrases used in the Punjabi-language and its dialects. Punjabi dictionaries were first published in the 19th century by printing presses operated by Christian missionaries. Punjabi dictionaries exist in romanized Punjabi, Gurmukhi, and Shahmukhi, or combinations of the three.\n\n Terminology and structure \nIn the Punjabi language, the word nirukat refers to an etymology, pariyay/priya/prayais refers to a glossary, and kosh refers to a dictionary.\n\nMany Punjabi dictionaries do not merely classify words as tatsamas, tadbhavas, or ardhatatsamas, but go beyond and use additional categorizations:\n\n Sanskritic tatsamas\n Ardhatatsamas\n Prakrit tadbhavas\n Braj tadbhavas\n Punjabic tadbhavas\n Borrowed – (a) from Perso-Arabic, (b) others, including English, French, Portuguese, as well as words of unknown origin\n\nPrakrit tadbhavas and Braj tadbhavas mostly occur in Sikh scriptures. Punjabi has adopted a high amount of Perso-Arabic borrowings. Perso-Arabic borrowings (nouns and adjectives in-particular) being used as proper names for both Sikhs and Hindus is a unique trait that Punjabi has amongst Indo-Aryan languages. There often exists a Sanskritic tatsama, Perso-Arabic borrowing, and Punjabic tadbhava for synonymous words.\n\n Dictionaries translating between Punjabi and English \n\n Background \nPunjabi lexicography can be traced back to the efforts by Christian missionaries. Punjabi, in Gurmukhi-script, was first printed by printing presses run by Christian missionaries, such as the Serampore Mission Press in Bengal and the Ludhiana Mission Press in Punjab. They established these printing presses to spread Christianity amongst the natives of the Indian subcontinent. In May 1806, the Serampore Mission Press began to experiment with printing in Punjabi, employing Gurmukhi script. In early reports by the Serampore Mission, they referred to the Punjabi-language and Gurmukhi-script as \"Seek\" (a reference to Sikhs, a term used interchangeably by the printing press for the Punjabi-language in Gurmukhi script and for Sikhs). By 1808, a type of Gurmukhi had already been developed by the press. The first Punjabi work printed in Gurmukhi characters with movable type began as early as 1809. The European missionaries were likely assisted by native pundits (for translating, punchcutting, and printing) and craftsmen in the creation of design or production of these types and the creation of letterforms. The first known Gurmukhi metal types were cut by Monohur (of the Karmakāra caste) or by unknown Indian assistants under the supervision of William Ward of the Serampore Mission Press. A Sikh man, named Ajnaram, assisted William Carey by translating the first ninety-two hymns of the Guru Granth Sahib. Ajnaram was paid a sum of five gold mohurs for his translation work. Ajnaram likely assisted the missionaries by translating texts into Punjabi and the development of printing types.\n\nRegarding the Punjabi-language, the Serampore Mission Press stated the following in one of its memoirs:\n\nthumb|Title-page of 'A Grammar of the Punjabee Language' (1812) by William Carey of the Serampore Mission Press, actually published in early 1813\nThe first non-religious book printed in Punjabi (Gurmukhi) was a grammar book (containing vocabulary), titled A Grammar of the Punjabee Language, by the Serampore Mission Press, published in early 1813 (although the published print bears the year 1812). Whilst Carey had begun printing the grammar book in 1811, a fire broke out at the Serampore Mission Press in 1812 that destroyed most of the work that had already been completed up til that point, so he again had to work alongside pundits, whom re-translated the work so a new edition could be brought-out. The Serampore Mission established various schools, such as the Serampore School (est. 1818), for the original purpose of spreading Christianity in India but later for theological studies and education of native Indians. These educational pursuits led the Serampore Mission to start publishing dictionaries, grammars, and scholastic textbooks, relating to local Indian languages.\n\nIn 1838, another grammar book on Punjabi, also titled A Grammar of the Punjabee Language, by Lieutenant John Leech of the Bombay Engineers, was published. Leech's Punjabi grammar book utilizes romanized Punjabi, with some Devanagari and Perso-Arabic usage as well. Leech must have published his grammar book without knowledge of the previous Punjabi grammar book of the same name that had earlier been published by William Carey. This publication was followed in 1849 by yet another grammar book on Punjabi by Captain Samuel Cross Starkey, whom was a British Colonial Officer in India. Starkey's grammar book only employs romanized Punjabi with no usage of native scripts. These early works showcase that not only were there merely religious motivations for improving communication between Europeans and Indians and producing literature on Indian languages, but there were also military reasons for doing-so.\n\nLater, the Ludhiana Mission was established in the Punjab due to the \"almost total lack of a Christian presence\". The missionaries associated with the Ludhiana Mission brought with them Persian, Gurmukhi, Devanagari, and Latin fonts to the Punjab from Calcutta, which allowed them to print literature in the various lects found in the Punjab. The Ludhiana Mission used the same kind of Gurmukhi font that had been previously cast and used by the earlier Serampore Mission. In 1846, during the First Anglo-Sikh War, the Ludhiana Mission Press published a work titled Idiomatic Sentences in English and Panjabi, which mostly covered military concerns, judicial situation, and medical information. However, the printing press faced difficulties in compiling this 1846 publication as there was still no established translating scheme between the English and Punjabi languages in use by the missionaries at Ludhiana. \n\nThe Ludhiana Mission Press, under the supervision of Reverend James Porter, published a grammar book on Punjabi by John Newton, titled A Grammar of the Panjabi Language; With Appendices in 1851. The motivation for publishing this grammar book was due to the aftermath of the annexation of much of Punjab in 1849 after the downfall of the Sikh Empire resulting from the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Many British colonial officials, only familiar with Urdu, began coming into Punjab after the 1849 annexation, so this work attempts to instruct them in the local Punjabi-language. Newton's Punjabi grammar book does make explicit mention of the previous grammar book that was written by William Carey, however whilst being sympathetic, Newton does note inaccuracies in Carey's earlier work. Newton's grammar book focuses mostly on how Punjabi grammar differs from Urdu grammar, rather than being solely dedicated to the comprehensive study of Punjabi's grammar itself. Newton's grammar book is divided into two main partitions: orthography and orthoepy (including syntax), with these main sections being divided into smaller parts based on adjectives, nouns, adverbs, pronouns, interjections, conjunctions, verbs, etc. Newton's Punjabi grammar book would later be republished in 1866, owing to its acclaim and popularity.\n\nA push for compiling the Punjabi dictionary may have come from the East India Company's language policies, as they were long eager to replace the Persian-language as the language of administration with local vernacular languages instead, requesting assistance from mission presses to publish grammar books and dictionaries to assist with this effort to move toward local vernaculars from Persian.\n\n First Punjabi dictionaries \nThe first Punjabi dictionary was A Dictionary, English and Punjabee, Outlines of Grammar, Also Dialogues, English and Punjabee, With Grammar and Explanatory Notes published in Calcutta in 1849. This dictionary authored by Captain Samuel Cross Starkey, whom was assisted in its compilation by jemadar Bussawa Singh. This dictionary was 256-pages and gave the Punjabi translation for 11,000 English words, all in the Latin script.thumb|Title-page of 'A Dictionary of the Panjabi Language' by the Ludhiana Mission (1854)\nThe grammar book of the Ludhiana Press was followed in 1854 by the publication of a Punjabi dictionary, titled A Dictionary of the Panjabi Language, also published by the Ludhiana Mission Press in 1854. This Punjabi dictionary published by the Ludhiana Mission Press had been a work a long time in the making, with it first being worked on by John Newton James Porter and Levi Janiver also assisted with the compilation of the dictionary. In 1841, the annual meeting of the mission gave Newton approval to begin compiling a Punjabi dictionary to assist those wanting to learn the Punjabi language, however Newton had already been collecting material to assist with compiling such a dictionary before this. However, John Newton was preoccupied with other duties of running the printing press and it was tedious work compiling the dictionary, leading to the dictionary being pushed-back by twelve years. Progress of the dictionary was also effected by the departure of prominent missionaries at the press, such as the loss of Reese Morris, and a fire that occurred at the printing press, shortage of funds, and difficulties acquiring printing paper. When the press finally recuperated its losses and restored itself, Newton resumed work on compiling a Punjabi dictionary. In the Twelfth annual report of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church, the missionaries of the press happily reported that almost 20,000 Punjabi words had been collected and arranged, with there being 8,000 fully complete translations into English of these collected words, with 6,000 partial translations yet to be completed, with the rest of the word remaining to have any translation work conducted on them. \n\nHowever, in 1850 work on the dictionary yet again was stalled due to the opening of the Lahore Mission, with many missionaries that were posted at the Ludhiana Mission being transferred there, including Newton himself. The dictionary was finally published in 1854 under the supervision of Levi Janiver, with a note in its preface written by John Newton noting four noteworthy remarks about the dictionary:\n\n The dictionary does not contain all the words used in the Punjabi language (the entirety of the Punjabi lexis is not fully represented).\n Some words found in the dictionary might not be in common circulation anymore.\n He describes the romanization style as being \"Shakespearean modified to suit the peculiarities of the Panjábí language\", which is similar to the precursor grammar book.\n The ਅ (áiṛá) and ਉ (uṛá) glyphs of Gurmukhi script have swapped places in-order, similar to how they arranged in the previous grammar book, whilst the rest of the thirty-five Gurmukhi letters (known as the paintí) are arranged the same way as they are locally by natives.\n\nThe Lahore Mission's 1854 Punjabi dictionary contained 438 triple-columned pages filled with around 25,000 words, mostly sourced from the dialect of Punjabi that was then spoken in and around Ludhiana. The dictionary contained both Latin and Gurmukhi scripts and was arranged according to the traditional ordering of the Gurmukhi letters (apart from the exception noted above involving the first two letters). John Newton and Levi Janiver were both praised by the mission after the publication of the dictionary, with the cost of producing the work almost being fully recuperated by its sales, proving that it was a useful resource for Christian missionaries and other people interested in learning the Punjabi-language. The 1854 Ludhiana Mission dictionary would inspire later colonial-era Punjabi vocabularies, glossaries, and dictionaries.\n\n Later colonial-era dictionaries \nthumb|First content-page of definitions from Maya Singh's dictionary ('The Panjábí Dictionary', Munshi Gulab Singh & Sons, 1895)\nLater colonial-era Punjabi dictionaries were either published as stand-alone books, as part of district settlement reports, or as an appendice adjoined to district gazetteers. Maya Singh, whom was an early member of the Lahore Singh Sabha and an editor of the Khalsa Gazette, was requested by Denzil Ibbetson to produce a lengthy Punjabi dictionary. Maya Singh's dictionary was eventually compiled and published in 1895 as a brief-entry dictionary, titled simply as The Panjábí Dictionary, under the supervision of the Punjab Textbook Committee, Lahore. Maya Singh's dictionary was mostly based upon the 1854 Ludhiana Mission dictionary, however it was ground-breaking in that it was a wide-ranging lexicography that was carried-out in a methodical manner. Maya Singh's dictionary was printed with 1221 large-sized, double-columned pages representing around 40,000 Punjabi words. Furthermore, it also contained usages, idioms, and dialectal variations for each entry. The information for the dialectal variations of Punjabi words utilized existing glossaries published on various dialects, with nearly all of the Punjabic dialects being represented in the work. Maya Singh's dictionary utilized both Latin and Gurmukhi scripts and it was arranged as per the order of the English alphabet, with the Punjabi headword being written in both Gurmukhi and Latin scripts. Addendums of Maya Singh's dictionary were later made by Horace Arthur Rose and also Thomas Grahame Bailey. A Shahmukhi version of Maya Singh's dictionary was prepared by Maqsood Saqib and published by Vanguard Books at Lahore in 1983.\n\nIn 1918, the University of Punjab, Lahore began a project of compiling a fully complete, consolidated, and comprehensive Punjabi-English dictionary due to solicitations, by George Abraham Grierson and the Punjab Government, of such a volume needing to be created. This effort was took-on by Banarsidas, whom was supervised by Alfred Cooper Woolner. Banarsidas, Woolner, and their assistant spent the next 10 years compiling this dictionary by collecting the required materials and following a scientific method. Punjabi words were arranged according to the alphabetical order of English. Four scripts would be employed in this dictionary: Latin, Gurmukhi, Devanagari, and Persian scripts. When nearing completion, the dictionary was divided into twenty-six volumes, containing around 80,000 Punjabi words and idioms in-sum across all the volumes. Between 1941–42, Banarsidas updated the draft of the dictionary and Teja Singh revised it between 1943–45 at Khalsa College, Amritsar. However, just when the printing of the dictionary finally began in 1947, pre-partition riots broke-out in Lahore, which led to the cancellation of the publishing of the dictionary. The unpublished manuscript of the dictionary remains locked-up at the Punjabi University's library in Lahore to this day.\n\n List of later colonial-era dictionaries \nA list of other later colonial-era Punjabi dictionaries are as follows:\n\n In 1895, A Vocabulary of Two Thousand Words from English Into Punjabi, by munshi Jawahar Singh, was published at Lahore. Jawahar Singh's work was mostly meant to be used by army officers.\n In 1897, a dictionary, titled Anglo-Gurmukhi Dictionary, by Lala Saligram Bajaj, was an early attempt at creating a regular English-Punjabi dictionary. Lala Saligram Bajaj's dictionary featured 649 double-columned pages where Punjabi translations of English words are offered in Gurmukhi script. This dictionary was printed at Lahore.\n In 1898, another Punjabi dictionary published in Ludhiana by the Ludhiana Mission, titled Panjábí Grammar, With Exercises and Vocabulary, authored by Reverend E. P. Newton, was released.\n In 1919, a Punjabi dictionary, simply titled as English-Punjabi Dictionary, was published at Calcutta, being authored by Reverend Thomas Grahame Bailey of the Scottish Mission in Wazirabad. This dictionary contained 5,800 words, including their Latin script equivalents, to assist Europeans learning the Punjabi language to converse with locals.\n In 1929, an English-to-Punjabi dictionary, titled An English-Punjabi Dictionary, by Rev. Canon Walter Pullin Hares (of the Church Missionary Society, Gojra), was published by the Civil and Military Gazette press. This dictionary was a landmark achievement in Punjabi lexicography, as it contains 15,000 English words with around 55,000 romanized Punjabi equivalents. \n Angrezi-Punjabi Kosh by Khush Lal Singh. \n Punjabi Arthawali by Amar Nath, an English-to-Punjabi dictionary featuring Punjabi translations of English words in both Latin and Persian scripts. \n Punjabi-Angrezi Kosh by Khushhal Singh (Lahore, 1946). Based upon Maya Singh's dictionary. \n Punjabi-English Vocabulary, a small lexicon published by the Sri Guru Singh Sabha, Lahore. Mostly derived from Maya Singh's dictionary. \n\n Dialect or region-specific colonial-era dictionaries \nMissionaries and officers of British India also produced Punjabi dictionaries focusing on Punjabic lects spoken in particular regions. Some examples are as follows:\n\n Glossary of the Multani Language Compared with Punjábi and Sindhi (Lahore, 1880) by Edward O'Brien – covering the Multani lect found in southwestern Punjab (now classified as a dialect of Saraiki). This work features a series of thematic glossaries and a Punjab-English glossary.\n Grammar and Dictionary of Western Panjabi, as Spoken in the Shahpur District, With Proverbs, Sayings, & Verses (Lahore, 1899) by James Wilson – covering the Shahpuri dialect.\n Dictionary of the Jatki or Western Panjábi Language (London, 1900) by Reverend Andrew Jukes of the Church Missionary Society of Derajats – covering the Jatki dialect.\n\n Post-independence dictionaries \nAfter the independence of India and Pakistan, the Punjabi dictionaries that had been published during the colonial-era were unsuitable for the demands of that time. This is because earlier dictionaries were limited in scope as they had been mostly compiled to serve foreigners, such as the colonial administration/officials and Christian missionaries. These earlier dictionaries neglected special areas of interest, which were to the detriment of developing Punjabi into a language of administration, scholarship, and instruction, in post-independence India. In 1948, the Publication Bureau of Punjab University in Shimla began working on compiling a comprehensive English-Punjabi dictionary to meet the requirements of the day, with the Concise Oxford Dictionary serving as its English vocabulary base. This project was undertaken by Teja Singh with the assistance of Harnam Singh 'Shan'. Due to the sudden decline of Teja Singh's health, only the first part of the dictionary was published in 1953, titled as The Standard English-Punjabi Dictionary. However, a comprehensive Punjabi-English lexicon, to the same magnitude as the unpublished draft manuscript that was prepared by the University of Punjab (Lahore), has yet to be completed post-1947. Many Punjabi dictionaries, both reprints and new works, are published by universities located in the state. Punjabi lexicographers, unlike grammarians, utilize older dictionaries when compiling new ones, attempting to maximize their coverage of the language. An English-Punjabi online dictionary, containing around 40,000 head-words (including scientific and technological jargon), was released by Punjabi University, Patiala in 2011, after having been developed by the university's Department of Linguistics and Punjabi Lexicography. In 2016, a software called Akhar, developed by the team of Gurpreet Singh Lehal from the Centre for Punjabi Language Technology of Punjabi University, was released. The 2021 version of Akhar, known as Akhar-2021, features a Punjabi-English dictionary function and a Gurmukhi-to-Shahmukhi transliterator. Many Punjabi dictionaries available today are digital, app-based dictionaries, such as U-Dictionary. PILAC in Pakistan is planning on compiling a Punjabi-English dictionary.\n\nA list of some Punjabi dictionaries from post-1947 are as follows:\n\n Punjabi-Angreji Shabadkosh (Amritsar, 1954) – jointly compiled by Saran Singh, Gurcharan Singh, and Tara Singh Sethi. It was mostly based on Maya Singh's 1895 dictionary and utilized for general purposes by students.\n Anglo-Punjabi Dictionary (Teja Singh, Ludhiana, 1955) – this dictionary was prepared by Teja Singh after his health got better. It is a concise version of the earlier dictionary he began working on with Harnam Singh 'Shan'. This dictionary contains 504 double-columned pages and was very influential in the future path of modern English-Punjabi dictionaries.\n Many practical Punjabi dictionaries, meant for students, were authored by S. S. Amole, Nihal Singh 'Ras', Bakhshish Singh, and Sant Ram Grover.\n English-Punjabi Dictionary (Department of Punjabi Literary Studies, Punjabi University, Patiala, 1968) – this dictionary features 703 double-columned pages. A revised edition, led by Gurdit Singh 'Premi', was published in 1971.\n PSUTB English-Punjabi Dictionary (Punjab State University Textbook Board, 1982) – this large-scale, brief-entry dictionary was the finalization of The Standard English-Punjabi Dictionary project that had been begun by Punjab University, Chandigarh. The stalled project was eventually revived and taken over by a collaborative effort between the department of lexicography and the Punjab State University Textbook Board. The chief-editors of this dictionary were Attar Singh and Balbir Singh Sandhu. It is a very large dictionary, containing 1407 large-sized, double-columned pages. The pronunciation of English words is displayed in Gurmukhi in bold-face that is aligned to the right-side of every colomn.\n Panjabi-Angrezi Lughat (Kanwal Bashir and Abbas Kazmi, Dunwoody Publishing & Press, 2012) – a Punjabi-English dictionary. The first edition of the dictionary features 2,500 main word entries arranged according to their frequency of use. Each entry features the head-word written in Shahmukhi, a romanization, pronunciation, parts of speech, and the definition. The end of the dictionary features appendices, such as a verb chart and a grammar.\n\n Dictionaries translating between Punjabi and non-English languages \n Hindi-Punjabi Kosh (Patiala, 1953) – a Hindi-Punjabi dictionary that was compiled by Sant Indar Singh Chakarvarti and published by the Punjabi Department, PEPSU, Patiala (now called the Languages Department of the Punjab Government). It contains 862 large-sized, double-columned pages that provide Punjabi translations for 60,000 Hindi words. The Hindi words are written using Devanagari whilst the Punjabi translations are written in Gurmukhi.\n Hindi Words Common to Other Indian Languages: Hindi-Punjabi (Central Hindi Directorate of the Ministry of Education, Government of India, New Delhi, 1960)\n Urdu-Punjabi-Hindi Kosh (Languages Department, Punjab Government, 1968)\n Punjabi Hindi-Kosh (1974)\n Romani-Punjabi-Angrezi Dictionary (1981) by Weer Rajendra Rishi.\n Punjabi-Urdu Dictionary (Sachal Studios and the Punjabi Adabi Board, 2009) by Sardar Mohammad Khan. A Punjabi-Urdu dictionary that covers 64 varieties of Punjabi over around 3,600 pages, containing idioms, riddles, and treatises related to Punjabi traditions and customs. The author is an ethnic Pathan. A small part of the dictionary was published as Punjabi Urdu Lughat in 1965 under his wife's name.\n Punjabi Urdu Lughat (Urdu Science Board, Lahore, 2008) – by Tanvir Bokhari.\n Pothohari Urdu Lughat (Zauraiz Publications, Multan, 2008) – a Pothohari-Urdu dictionary by Muhammad Sharif Shad.\n\n Monolingual Punjabi dictionaries \nWhilst examples of pre-1947 Punjabi-Punjabi dictionaries do exist, they mostly began to be produced after independence in 1947. The most notable Punjabi dictionary of this type was one that began to be worked upon initially for the purpose of cultivating Punjabi as a state language of PEPSU (Patiala and East Punjab States Union). This project began in 1948, with the task of compiling such a dictionary being the responsibility of Ranjit Singh Gill and Giani Lal Singh, with the projected being assigned to Banarsidas. However, Banarsidas retired in 1954, so this responsibility was transferred to Jit Singh Sital, and after him to Dalip Singh. Dalip Singh had a group of scholars and linguists to help him compile the dictionary. In 1955, the first volume of the dictionary was published. It took until 1983 for the sixth and final volume of the dictionary to be published by the Language Department of Punjab in Patiala. This dictionary is titled as Punjabi Kosh and it contains 3500 large-sized, double-columned pages which contain around 150,000 entries. Its entries cover subsidiary formations, usages, idioms, proverbs, and other linguistic aspects. The system of the dictionary is as follows: forms of the head-word give grammatical form, etymology, semantic distinction, dialectical formation, various shades of meaning, and providing many illustrations to describe the words. On 26 February 2014, Punjabi University launched Punjabipedia, a Punjabi-language encyclopedia website that features entries from Punjabi dictionaries. The Punjab Institute of Language, Art and Culture (PILAC) in Pakistan has published a large Punjabi-Punjabi dictionary. PILAC's dictionary spans seven volumes and was compiled over two years by a team of ten researchers under the purview of Sughra Sadaf.\n\n List of monolingual Punjabi dictionaries \nExamples of dictionaries of this type are as follows:\n\n Punjabi Shabad Bhandar (Lahore, 1922) – compiled by Bhai Bishandas Puri under the supervision of the Punjab Textbook Committee, Lahore.\n Punjabi Shabad-Joar by Teja Singh (Punjabi Department of PEPSU, Patiala, 1951) – a spelling dictionary.\n Shabad Ratnakar Arthat Punjabi Shabadkosh by Giani Nihal Singh Ras (Jalandhar, 1954).\n Parmanik Punjabi Kosh by Kartar Singh (first part published in Ludhiana, 1963).\n Punjabi Shabad-Rup Te Shabad-Joar Kosh compiled by Harkirat Singh (Punjabi University, Patiala, published in separate fascicle installments in 1966, 1968, 1980, and 1982) – a spelling dictionary.\n Punjabi Paryaye Ate Viparayaye by Gulwant Singh, Prem Parkash Singh, and Jeet Singh Sital (Punjabi University, Patiala, 1968) – a dictionary covering synonyms and antonyms, containing 192 pages.\n Punjabi Ucharan Dictionary by Mohammad Khan (1982) – spelling dictionary published in Pakistani Punjab that contains 12,000 Punjabi words written in Perso-Arabic script over 176 pages.\n Vaddi Panjabi Lughat: Panjabi Tun Panjabi (Aziz Publishers, Lahore, 2002) – a comprehensive Punjabi-Punjabi dictionary by Muhammad Iqbal Salah-ud-Din. It was published in three volumes.\n\n Dialects and regional languages \nPunjabi dictionaries covering dialects and regional languages (some formerly classified as Punjabic) include:\n\n Pothohari Shabad Kosh (Language Department, Punjab Government, 1960) – covering Pothohari dialect.\n Puedhi Shabad Kosh (Language Department, Punjab Government, 1960) – covering Puadhi dialect.\n Kangri Shabad-Sangrah (Language Department, Punjab Government, 1964) – covering Kangri, now classified as part of the Western Pahari languages.\n Malwai Shabad Kosh by Manmandar Singh – covering the Malwai dialect.\n Lehndi Kosh by Hardev Bahri – covering Lahnda (Western Punjabi).\n Khalsaee Bole by Jawala Singh – covering the Khalsa Bole lect spoken by Nihang Sikhs.\n Lughat-e-Saraiki – Saraiki dictionary by Bashir Ahmad Zami Bahawlpuri.\n Saraiki Samal – Saraiki dictionary by Jamshed Kamtar Rasoolpur.\n Pehli Wadi Saraiki Lughat (Saraiki Area Study Centre, Bahauddin Zakriya University, Multan, 2007) – a comprehensive Saraiki dictionary by Mohammad Saadullah Khan Khetran.\n\n Specialized and technical dictionaries \nPunjabi dictionaries, including monolingual, bilingual, and trilingual types, covering jargon from specialized fields and technical aspects, were published by individual authors and institutions. The publishing of specialized Punjabi dictionaries increased after independence in 1947 as Punjabi was refined for the purpose of being used as an administrative, legal, medical, educational, and academic language.\n\n List of specialized and technical dictionaries \n\n Medical \n Chakitsa Kosh by Sadhu Gurdit Singh (published in four parts, Amritsar, 1888) – medical dictionary containing the Punjabi translations of yunani and ayurvedic terminology and medicine names).\n Aukhadh Parkash Arthat Yunani Vaidikda Kosh by Giani Gurbakhsh Singh (Amritsar, 1890) – medicial dictionary.\n Nighant Vaidik Kosh by Sewa Singh Grover (Amritsar) – medical dictionary.\n Nighant Yunani Kosh by Surat Singh (Ludhiana, 1911) – medical dictionary.\n Doktorki Shabdavali (Punjabi University, Patiala) – medical science dictionary for higher-education.\n\n Legal \n Qanuni Sanket Kosh by justices Lachmandas Kaushal and Ranjit Singh Sarkaria (Patiala, 1950) – a bilinguial dictionary giving meanings in both Hindi and Punjabi of around 10,000 legal words/terms over 570 pages.\n Anglo-Punjabi Dictionary of Legal Terms by sessions judge Bhagat Singh (Patiala, 1953) – covering around 20,000 legal terms.\n Qanuni Shabdavali by Rajinder Singh (Bhasha Vibhag, Patiala, 1970) – law dictionary.\n\n Financial \n Shabad Kosh (Patiala, 1949) – an English-Punjabi dictionary of terms for the PEPSU state budget of 1949–50.\n\n Administration \n Angrezi-Hindi-Punjabi Parbandhiki Shabdavali (Bhasha Vibhag, Patiala, 1968).\n Lokparshasan (Punjab State University Textbook Board, Chandigarh, 1976) – public administration dictionary for university students.\n Lok Parshasan Shabdavali (Punjabi University, Patiala) – public administration dictionary for higher-education.\n\n Education \n Angrezi-Punjabi Takniki Shabadavali: Itihas (Bhasha Vibhag, Patiala, 1969) – English-Punjabi glossary to be used for history students.\n Angrezi-Punjabi Takniki Shabdavali: Itihas (Punjab State University Textbook Board, Chandigarh, 1973) – history dictionary for university students.\n Bhugolik Shabdavali (Punjabi University, Patiala) – geography dictionary for higher-education.\n\n Literature \n Sahitya Sanket by Diwan Singh and Premparkash Singh (Jalandhar, 1956) – dictionary on literary terms.\n\n Miscellaneous \n Handbook of the Economic Products and of the Manufactures and Arts of the Punjab by B.

An early sample of such a kind of dictionary are three glossary manuscripts known as Paryaye that are preserved in the Bavarian State Library in Munich. These manuscripts were collected by Ernest Trumpp during his time at Lahore in 1871. The Paryaye describe archaic and obsolete local words but also loanwords from Arabic and Persian, that were employed in Sikh scripture. Trumpp would later publish his own dictionary of the Sikh scriptures, titled A Dictionary of the Adi-Granth (Lahore-Munich, 1872), however the manuscript is lost. Trumpp would publish a full translation of the Guru Granth Sahib into English in 1877 but his translation was strongly rebuked and criticized by Sikhs as being biased against their religion. Many of the Sikh dictionaries are monolingual Punjabi works.\n\n List of Sikh scriptural dictionaries \nOther Sikh dictionaries are as follows:\n\n Paryaye Sri Guru Granth Sahibji-ke by Daya Singh (Amritsar, 1887).\n Sri Guru Granth Kosh by Giani Hazara Singh (Amritsar, 1889) – this dictionary would be revised numerous times into further editions, with a 2nd (nine small parts, Amritsar, 1923), 3rd (expanded and revised into three volumes of double-columned pages, Amritsar, 1927), and 4th edition (two volumes, Amritsar, 1950 and 1954, later consolidated into one volume in Amritsar, 1982) being published. Vir Singh compiled its third edition. It covers the classical Punjabi-language used in the Guru Granth Sahib. The name of the dictionary translates to \"dictionary of the holy book\".\n A variety of manuscripts known respectively as Guru Gira Padarthavali Kosh, Sankhep Ekakhari Kosh, and Guru Granth Anekarthi Kosh, by Pandit Bhagwan Singh (Amritsar, circa 1890).\n Adi-Granth Da Kosh by Vishnudas Udasi (Amritsar, 1892).\n Sri Guru Granth Sahibji-ke Madh Se Paryaye Farsi Padan De Jo Ati Kathan The by Giani Bhai Chanda Singh (Amritsar, 1894).\n Guru Girarath Kosh by Tara Singh Narotam (compiled in 1889, published at Patiala State in 1895) – this was the first completed dictionary of the Guru Granth Sahib. It consisted of 717 large-sized pages and influenced the Sikh dictionaries compiled thereafter.\n Paryaye Adi Sri Guru Granth Sahibji-de by Sant Sute Parkash (Amritsar, 1898).\n Kosh Adi Sri Guru Granth Sahibji by Sadhu Bishan Das Udasi, in two volumes (Amritsar, 1898).\n Guru Shabad Ratnakar Mahan Kosh, popularly referred to simply as Mahan Kosh, by Kahn Singh Nabha (1930) – dictionary on classical Sikh literature. It is fully in Punjabi.\n Sri Guru Bani Parkash by Sodhi Teja Singh, in two volumes (1932–1952) – 2nd edition published at Amritsar in 1953 by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee.\n Kosh Adi Granth Sahib by Giani Lal Singh Sangrur (Patiala, 1949).\n Kosh Sri Dasam Granth Sahib by Giani Lal Singh Sangrur, in two volumes (Amritsar, 1954) – dictionary of the Dasam Granth.\n Kosh Adi Guru Granth Sahib by Giani Partap Singh Jotshi (Amritsar, 1958).\n Gurbani Kosh by Piara Singh Padam (Patiala, 1960).\n Varan Bhai Gurdas: Shabad Anukarmnika Ate Kosh by Rattan Singh Jaggi (Patiala, 1966) – dictionary of the Varan of Bhai Gurdas Bhalla.\n Nirukat Sri Guru Granth Sahib by Balbir Singh, with assistance by Mohindar Kaur and G. S. Anand (in two volumes, Patiala, 1972 and 1975)– the first etymological dictionary of the Guru Granth Sahib, published by Punjabi University, Patiala. It contains 484 pages of 22 x 28 size. The first efforts to compile such a work was begun by Vir Singh in his Santhya Sri Guru Granth Sahib (nine volumes), later the effort was taken over and completed by his brother, Balbir Singh.\n\n Scholarly analysis \nPunjabi lexicography still remains a nascent field lacking depth due to a variety of organizational and inherent factors. Punjabi dictionaries tend to over-represent nouns and under-represent other word classes, like verbs and adjectives. Punjabi lexicographers give little attention to compound or conjunct verbs. They also tend to group nouns together which may have subtle differences in nuance, misleading the readers into assuming they are the same. Punjabi dictionaries also often enforce particular grammatical gender of nouns and voices of verbs which are not so rigid in the actual language and can vary considerably. Punjabic tadbhavas (including the various patterns of word derivation) tend to be overlooked in Punjabi literature, including dictionaries, due to scholars pursuing literary formalism. In Pakistan, regional languages are neglected in the lexicographical field, with the number of dictionaries available for Punjabi (and Saraiki) lacking, despite the large amounts of people who speak these tongues.\n\n Notes \n\n References \n\n External links \n\n Digitized Punjabi grammar books \n\n A Grammar of the Punjabee Language (early 1813), by William Carey, Serampore Mission Press\n A Grammar of the Punjabee Language (1838) by John Leech, Bombay Government Press\n A Grammar of the Panjabi Language; With Appendices (1851) by John Newton, Lodhiana Mission Press\n\n Digitized Punjabi dictionaries \n\n A Dictionary, English and Punjabee, Outlines of Grammar, Also Dialogues, English and Punjabee, With Grammar and Explanatory Notes (1849) by Samuel Cross Starkey and Bussawa Singh, Calcutta, D'Rozario & Company.\n A Dictionary of the Panjabi Language (1854) by John Newton, James Porter, and Levi Janiver, Lodhiana Mission Press\n The Panjábí Dictionary (1895) by Maya Singh, Lahore, Munshi Gulab Singh & Sons\n Glossary of the Multani Language Compared with Punjábi and Sindhi (1881) by Edward O'Brien, Lahore, The Punjab Government Civil Secretariat Press\n Grammar and Dictionary of Western Panjabi, as Spoken in the Shahpur District, With Proverbs, Sayings, & Verses (1899) by James Wilson, Lahore, The Punjab Government Press\n Dictionary of the Jatki or Western Panjábi Language (1900) by Andrew Jukes, Lahore, Religious Book and Tract Society\n English-Punjabi Dictionary (1991 reprint, first published in 1919) by Thomas Grahame Bailey, New Delhi, Publications India\n\n Online dictionaries \n\n Punjabi-English Dictionary by the Research Centre for Punjabi Language Technology at Punjabi University, Patiala\n Punjabi dictionaries available for online searching by Digital Dictionaries of South Asia, Digital South Asia Library\n Akhar software (Punjabi-English dictionary function included) developed by Centre for Punjabi Language Technology, Punjabi University\n Shabdkosh English-Punjabi dictionary\n SriGranth an online dictionary that features entries sourced from the Mahan Kosh and other Punjabi/Gurmukhi dictionaries\n Punjabi App features a Punjabi-English and Hindi-Punjabi online dictionary, plus Gurmukhi, Shahmukhi, Devanagari, and Latin transliteration tools\n Online Shahmukhi dictionary\n Punjabi Shahmukhi to Urdu and English dictionary\n Lexicool compilation of various Punjabi-English dictionaries\n\nPunjabi\nDictionary",

        "title": "2024 Serbian environmental protests",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Serbian_environmental_protests",
        "content": "In July 2024, a series of environmental protests began in Serbia against the Jadar mine, a European Union–backed and Serbian government-approved lithium mining project. The project was proposed by Anglo-Australian Rio Tinto to develop Europe's largest lithium mine in the West Serbian region of Jadar, causing significant backlash due to its potential environmental damage and exploitation of the local population for economic and geopolitical gain.\n\n Background \nLithium is a critical element needed for the production of batteries used in electric vehicles and mobile devices, and had significantly increased demand in the 2020s due to the global shift towards renewable energy and electric transportation, especially for the automotive industry. The European Union and the United States have designated lithium as a \"strategically important resource\".\n\nSerbia is home to one of Europe's largest lithium reserves, located in the Jadar valley region of western Serbia with a population of about 18,000 people. The region contains wide stretches of diverse forest ecosystems, agricultural land, and water resources from the Jadar river. Many farmers live and work in the valley due to its fertile soil, with several families living in the region for generations. Multinational mining company Rio Tinto probed the region for several years and desired to launch efforts to excavate its large lithium supply to meet global demand for lithium.\n\nSerbia's candidacy to join the European Union has been complicated due to its difficulties toward meeting its environmental standards, with Serbia being deemed one of Europe's most polluted nations.\n\n Prelude \n\nIn 2021 to 2022, widespread environmental protests across Serbia, which included blocking several high-traffic roads and bridges in Belgrade and other regions, led to the suspension of Rio Tinto's lithium mining project in the region. The Serbian Prime Minister at the time, Ana Brnabić, stated that \"everything is finished\" and that the project was \"over\". However, in early July 2024, Serbia's constitutional court overruled the prior cancellation of the US$2.4 billion mining project. The court claimed that the initial ruling was \"not in accordance with the Constitution or the law\" and reinstated the company's licence to mine in the region.\n\nOn 19 July 2024, following EU pressure, President of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić, Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz, and European Union energy chief Maroš Šefčovič met and signed an agreement regarding the European Union's access to \"critical raw materials\" mined in Serbia, representing a further step towards facilitating the Jadar mining project. The deal represented an effort by Europe to lower its dependency on China for essential minerals such as lithium, as well as aligning Serbia more closely with the EU instead of with Russia and China, especially in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and China's diplomatic and economic partnership with Russia. Vučić claimed that the mine would \"not endanger anyone or anything\", and planned to grant locals \"new jobs and better salaries\".\n\n Protests \nThe reinstatement of Rio Tinto's mining licence triggered a new wave of indignation and protests across Serbia. Many environmentalists argued that the excavation would cause irreversible environmental damage to the agriculturally fertile Jadar valley, while offering limited benefits to Serbian citizens, especially locals in the region. Many emphasised the importance of preserving Serbia's natural resources and ecosystems over short-term economic gains, with Biljana Stepanovic, a representative of the Proglas rights organisation, stating that \"we cannot live without clean air and water, but we can live without lithium batteries and electric cars\". Locals and business owners feared that the project would pose an existential threat to local communities in the region.\n\nOne of the environmentalist groups called \"Ne damo Jadar\" (English: We won't give up Jadar) strictly opposed the plans and began to set up local protests starting in June 2024. Group representative and local farmer Zlatko Kokanovic stated:\n\nThe group feared that the resulting landfills and pollution would devastate the ecosystem, poison the river's water supply, destroy agricultural farmland, and introduce toxic particles into the air, causing significant increases in disease and cancer rates.\n\nHe also condemned Germany's role in pushing the project forward at the expense of Serbian farmers and locals, retorting:\n\n Political opposition \nOpposition MP and environmentalist Aleksandar Jovanović Ćuta called the approved mining plan \"an epic crime against people and nature\". He referred to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz as a \"little American puppet\" who was content with displacing the citizens living in Gornje Nedeljice that \"feed Serbia\". He further stated:\n\nHe warned the government that if they did not outlaw the mining operations and future exploitation of raw materials, that the locals would start \"a rebellion\".\n\n Rallies \nOn 29 July 2024, thousands of protesters gathered in the city of Šabac, located approximately 50 kilometres northeast of the proposed mine site. Protesters in Šabac marched through the town, with many waving Serbian flags.\n\nDemonstrations simultaneously occurred in the central Serbian towns of Barajevo, Kraljevo, Ljig, and Aranđelovac. In Kraljevo, activist Nebojsa Kovandzic rallied protesters around the claim that the Serbian government was prioritising its interests towards economic and diplomatic opportunities over those of the citizens. Many environmental groups threatened to escalate future protests, announcing plans to block major railroads and junctions in August 2024 as a form of civil disobedience.\n\n Response \nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz attempted to assure protesters by suggesting that the project would only proceed if it complied with EU environmental standards, which was generally met with scepticism from protesters and environmental groups.\n\nIn response to escalating protests, Serbian President Vučić announced that the government would set up a referendum on the project by the end of 2025. Vučić also stated that no operations would begin before 2028, and would make sure to follow environmental guidelines stringently before construction started.\n\n See also \n\n 2017 Serbian protests\n Serbian protests (2018–2020)\n 2020–2022 Serbian protests\n 2021–2022 Serbian environmental protests\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:2024 in Serbia\nCategory:2024 protests\nCategory:July 2024 events in Serbia\nCategory:Environmental protests\nCategory:Environmentalism in Europe\nCategory:Political history of Serbia\nCategory:Protests in Serbia\nCategory:2024 in the European Union\nCategory:21st-century protests",

        "title": "Meyer Road",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyer_Road",
        "content": "Meyer Road is a primary access street in Katong, Singapore. Named in 1921 after Sir Manasseh Meyer, it stretches from Tanjong Rhu Road to Tanjong Katong Road at a length of 1.4km. It is connected to many prominent past and present landmarks such as Katong Park (and by extension, Fort Tanjong Katong) and formerly the Crescent Flats and Meyer Flats (thought to be Singapore's first luxurious beach-front condominiums) as well as Katong Park Hotel (Malaya's biggest hotel since World War 2). It is nicknamed \"the Little India of East Coast\" due to the large number of Indian residents living there.\n\n History \nthumb|Sea View Hotel in 1928, shortly after it was rebuilt|left\nThe road was named after Sir Manasseh Meyer, a Jewish businessman known for his extensive philanthropic efforts such as donating to those in or out of the Jewish community as well as establishing Singapore's only synagogues: the Chesed-El Synagogue and the Maghain Aboth Synagogue. Ostensibly, the road was named by Sir Meyer himself since he owned the old Sea View Hotel and the Adelphi Hotel, the former of which was located at present-day Meyer Road. However, the name of the road was established in 1921 as a part of a street-naming exercise to simplify the house numbering system in Katong. Prior to land reclamation works in the area, the road \"enjoyed an enviable seafront.\" Sharon Lim Weekend East reported in March 1993 that penthouses in eastern parts of Singapore, \"especially those in the Meyer Road area\", had \"soared in value.\"\n\nIt is thought that the earliest beach-front, luxurious condominiums built in Singapore were located on Meyer Road: the Crescent Flats in 1909 and the Meyer Flats in 1928 (both built by Sir Meyer). The crescent curves for both buildings were inspired by the design of terrace houses in Bath, United Kingdom. Both were demolished in the early 1990s.\n\nthumb|Fort Tanjong Katong in 1880Arguably, one of the most famous landmarks connecting to Meyer Road is Katong Park. Katong Park was initially built by the British in 1879 as a coastal fortress to defend against sea attacks. However, in 1901, it was abandoned and buried. Subsequently, Katong Park was built over the buried fort and was opened on 19 December 1931. Between September and October 1963, a total of three bombs exploded in Katong Park as a part of the Konfrontasi. Apart from there being no casualties, the bombs did damage nearby cars and the windows of the Ambassador Hotel (better known as Katong Park Hotel) on the opposite side of the park. The park remained popular until the 1960s, when reclamation works in the area shifted the shore away from the park, which lost it seafront. The extension of Fort Road also led to much of the park being demolished.\n\nthumb|The Embassy Hotel in March 1953, a month before its opening\nAnother famous landmark that was in Meyer Road was the Katong Park Hotel (formerly the Embassy Hotel, Hotel Ambassador, and Duke Hotel). Opened on 26 April 1953, it was operated as the Embassy Hotel by the descendants and relatives of the late Lim Ah Eng. The Embassy Hotel was famed for being Malaya's biggest hotel since World War 2. It was closed in 1960 and was briefly opened, closed, and renamed a few times before being owned by the Tan family in 1994. They tried to sell it in September 1998 but they withdrew it due to selling it for a high price. However, since the Tan family failed to repay the Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions from November 1997 to May 1998, the CPF board declared the Katong Hotel to be insolvent, therefore resulting in the closure of it. It was demolished to make way for the condominium project TheView@Meyer by GuocoLand, which was completed in 2006.\n\n Details \nMeyer Road is a primary access street that stretches from Tanjong Rhu Road to Tanjong Katong Road at a length of 1.4km. According to The Sunday Times, the road \"offers a fairly wide mix of housing choices\", with a \"clear delineation\" between the condominium complexes on one side of the road and the semi-detached houses on the other and offers \"relative peace and [quietness]\". The neighbourhood is popular with Indian expatriates due to its location near East Coast Park and the city. In fact, the surrounding area of Meyer Road is nicknamed the \"Little India of the East Coast\" due to a large number of North Indians living there.\n\nLandmarks\n\nthumb|Chinese National Day at 61 Meyer Road in 1936\nthumb|\"Hollywood\" in September 1934\nthumb|The residence of M. E. Isaac in 1938\nthumb|Exit 1 of Katong Park station along Meyer Road\nThe following is a list of landmarks that are/were near Meyer Road:\n\n 30 Meyer Road, a bungalow worked on by little-known British architect Eric Vernon Miller. The house was bought by Singaporean entrepreneur and philanthropist Jack Sim in the 1990s. Sim restored the building, which by then had become a \"wreck\".\n 58 Meyer Road, a bungalow which was rented out to Low Pui-Kim (also known as Liu Beijin), an entrepreneur of Muar, Malaysia. Liu established the film production studio of the Low Pui-Kim Nanyang Independent Film Production Company at the building in July 1926. The company produced New Friend, the first locally produced film. It was partially filmed in the bungalow, which also housed a staff dormitory and a film processing room. The studio moved to 333 Pasir Panjang Road following the film's release. However, plans for a second film never materialised.\n 61 Meyer Road, which was the residence of Parkcane C. Hwang, the founder and manager of the local branch of the Bank of China. The \"huge\" house was built by Manasseh Meyer, who died in 1930, shortly after it was completed. His wife, Rebecca, then rented the house to the bank.\n 87 Meyer Road (former residence of Lee Seng Gee, chairman of the Lee foundation)\n Aalto\n Belaria, an \"E\"-shaped bungalow at 165 Meyer Road. Owned by Jacob M. Meyer, a twin son of Manasseh Meyer, the house served as the holiday home of the Meyer family. A September 1934 article in The Straits Times described it as \"easily the most distinguished building along Meyer Road\", featuring a \"lovely view of the island-studded south and east and all the variety of the international marine life of a busy Eastern port.\" Its garden was then \"fast becoming one of the prettiest in the neighbourhood.\" The bungalow was also among the few houses in the Katong area with \"modern sanitation\" at the time.\n Crescent Flats\n Crescent Road\n Eastern Mansion, a condominium. It was demolished to make way for Aalto.\n Fort Road\n Fort Tanjong Katong (buried underneath Katong Park, part of it is displayed there)\n Hollywood, a \"Californian\"-style bungalow designed mostly by the wife of lawyer and historian Sir Roland Braddell with his assistance. It was built in 1928 after Braddell had heard of the site through Meyer, who was his landlord. The Straits Times reported in September 1934 that \"Mrs. Braddell's sense of colour and form has blended splendidly with Mr. Braddell's strong sense of beauty; both have a flair for art and besides gathering around them the works of masters, model and paint themselves.\" The interior was fitted by furniture designed by Mrs. Braddell and made by the Frankel family.\n Katong Park\n Katong Park MRT station, which was built under the road. Opened as part of Stage 4 of the Thomson–East Coast MRT line on 23 June 2024, the station has two exits serving the Meyer Road area.\n Katong Park Hotel (formerly the Embassy Hotel, Hotel Ambassador, and Duke Hotel, now replaced by TheView@Meyer).\n M. E. Isaac's residence, which was listed by The Straits Times in March 1938 as an example of \"modern, flat-roofed reinforced concrete\" buildings that indicated a \"departure\" from the \"old style of domestic architecture in Malaya\", along with the then-under construction bungalow of Chee Guan Chiang on Grange Road, the smaller bungalow within the same estate which served as Chee's temporary residence prior to the completion of the main building, and the residence of surveyor Langdon Williams on Golf Club Road (now Sime Road).\n Meyer Flats\n Meyer Park, a condominium complex featuring one 21-storey block and one 11-storey block. It was designed by architect Thng Hooi Haw, who intended to provide every unit with an \"angular\" view of the sea. In February 2023, it was sold en bloc to United Venture Development, a joint venture between the UOL Group and the Singapore Land Group, for $392.18 million.\n Mindanao Gum Tree (displayed at Katong Park)\n Sea View Hotel, which opened in 1906. Owned by Manasseh Meyer, it was leased to Eleazar Johannes in 1912. It took over the nearby Grove Hotel as an annexe by the following year. The Sarkies Brothers became the managers of the hotel in 1923, after which it underwent a major refurbishment. The estate of Meyer took ownership of the hotel in 1931. In 1936, it was described in Willis' Singapore Guide as one of three leading hotels in Singapore. It was closed in 1964, after which it was demolished.\n Tanjong Katong MRT station (Exit 1)\n Tanjong Katong Road\n Tanjong Rhu Road\n TheView@Meyer\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Roads in Singapore\nCategory:Central Region, Singapore",

        "title": "Perianal injectable bulking agent",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perianal_injectable_bulking_agent",
        "content": "These procedures aim to inject bio-compatible material (perianal injectable bulking agents, also termed sphincter bulking agents or biomaterial injectables) into the walls of the anal canal, in order to bulk out these tissues. This may bring the walls of the anal canal into tighter contact, raising the resting pressure, creating more of a barrier to the loss of stool, and thereby reducing fecal incontinence. This procedure has many advantages over more invasive surgery, since there are rarely any serious complications.\n\nHistory\nOriginally, injectable bulking agents were used to treat stress urinary incontinence in females. The procedure aimed to bulk out the tissues of the neck of the bladder, and it was successful. The technique was first used for FI in 1993 by an Egyptian surgeon. He used polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE/polytef/Teflon) paste injected into the submucosal layer of anal canal. Later publications described autologous transplantation of fat from the abdominal wall or the buttock. After about the year 2000, many different materials started to be used as well as variations of the technique. Some of these materials were concurrently being used to treat urinary incontinence. The latest development of this technique is the implantable bulking agents \"Gatekeeper\" and \"Sphinkeeper\". These are not injectable materials but rather implants which expand after placement. As such, they are termed \"self-expandable prostheses\", and the term \"non-self-expandable prostheses\" is used to refer to older injectable materials. \n\nProcedure\nThe exact methods of this procedure are not standardized and vary considerably, for example the exact number and locations of the injections and the volume of the injected material. \n\nBefore the operation, antibiotic prophylaxis may be given. The rectum is prepared with a phosphate enema at least 2 hours before the procedure. The procedure can be carried out under local anesthetic on an out patient basis, or with caudal epidural anesthesia, or with intravenous sedation, or under general anesthesia. Ultrasound guidance may be used during the injections, which is sometimes reported as being more effective than the surgeon simply palpating (feeling) and looking where to inject.\n\nThe site of the bulking material can be inter-sphincteric (in the space between the IAS and the EAS), submucosal injections (under the mucosal layer, usually just above the dentate line), or within the IAS itself. Injection of the material can be by the different routes: transanal route, trans-sphincteric, intersphincteric, perianal route (going through the muscle complex) or transcutaneous route. As such, there are several different variations of injection location and route:\n Trans-sphincteric route into the IAS, \n Inter-sphincteric route into the IAS, \n Inter-sphincteric route into the submucosa, \n Trans-anal injection into the submucosa (similar to injection sclerotherapy for haemorrhoids), \n Trans-sphincteric route into the inter-sphincteric space, \n Inter-sphincteric route into the inter-sphincteric space, \n Trans-sphincteric route injecting submucosally.\n\nThe perianal injection route (intersphincteric or transsphincteric) gives better results than the transanal route according to one review. Submucosal implant location may have a higher risk of erosion and sepsis.\n\nInjectable materials\nMany different materials have been used as perianal injectable bulking agents. The ideal injectable or implantable material would be biocompatible, non-migratory, non-allergenic, non-carcinogenic and non-immunogenic (and therefore induce a minimal inflammatory and fibrotic reaction). The material should also be easy to inject. The particles should be greater than 80 µm in diameter in order to prevent migration away from the injection site. On the other hand, materials with particles small enough to be used in small caliber needles may be desirable, in order to leave a smaller needle track, which may reduce the chance of leakage of the material via the needle track. Alternatively, some materials are shape-retaining porous hydrogels with no particles. The ideal material should produce an improvement in continence not only in the short term, but in the long term, and repeated procedures should not be necessary. Technically, most materials are particles suspended in a carrier (excipient) solution, which is usually a biodegradable gel. It is not known which of the available materials is the best.\n\n Autologous fat (fat tissue transferred from elsewhere in the body). \n Teflon.  \n Bovine glutaraldehyde cross‐linked collagen (collagen from cows).  \n Carbon‐coated zirconium/graphite beads (\"Durasphere\").  \n Polydimethylsiloxane elastomer (silicone) biomaterial implants (\"PTQ implant\"). \n Dextranomer in non‐animal stabilised hyaluronic acid (\"Solesta\", \"NASHA Dx\"). \n Hydrogel cross‐linked with polyacrylamide (\"Bulkamid\"). \n Porcine dermal collagen (collagen from pig skin, \"Permacol\").  \n Synthetic calcium hydroxylapatite ceramic microspheres.  \n Polyacrylonitrile in cylinder form. \n aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA).\n\nTeflon (polytef)\nThis was the original material used as a bulking agent, first used to treat urinary incontinence in 1964, and then about 20 years later it was the first material used as a bulking agent to treat FI.  Polytef paste is polytetrafluoroethylene, glycerin and polysorbide. The particles are mostly very small in size (4–40-µm). Research in animals has shown that these particles migrate and may be found in lymph nodes, lungs, kidneys, spleen and brain. If the material mostly migrates away, any benefit will be temporary, and there are safety concerns that it could lead to the formation of foreign body granulomas and the development of sarcoma.\n\nAutologous fat transplant\nThis variation of the procedure uses the patient's own fat cells, and therefore is non-allergenic and non-immunogenic. The fat cells are taken from the abdominal wall by suction. Then they are purified and put into a saline solution before injection. When used in other fields such as urology or facial surgery, autologous fat transplants have very rarely been reported to cause fat embolism and stroke. This material is also subject to rapid digestion and migration.\n\nPTQ implant\nThis is a silicone biomaterial, marketed as \"PTQ\" or \"Bioplastique\". It is polydimethylsiloxane elastomer particles suspended in a biocompatible carrier hydrogel of poly-N-vinyl-pyrrolidone (povidone). Significantly more publications exist which investigate this material compared to the other materials, and it has been the most widely used bulking material used for FI. Publications used inter-sphincteric or  within IAS injection sites via the trans-sphincteric route. The particles are in the range 100–450 µm with smaller particles in the gel. Therefore there is a possibility of migration and granuloma formation. There are also concerns about a link between autoimmune diseases and silicone. The bulking agent is very viscous which makes it difficult to inject. After injection there is irregular collagen deposition around and inside the implant. \n\nDurasphere\nAfter PTQ, this material has most scientific publications. Publications described using it via the transmucosal or trans-sphincteric routes, with the end location of the material being the submucosa. It is composed of carbon-coated zirconium beads (pyrolytic carbon-coated beads) in a water-based carrier gel containing β-glucan. Pyrolytic carbon is not biologically reactive and does not undergo degradation. It is used in various medical devices including heart valves. The particle size of Durasphere is in the range 212-500 µm, which is approximately 3 times the migration threshold of 80 μm. However, one report of the material as used in urology showed significant migration to local and distant lymph nodes.\n\nDextranomer in sodium hyaluronate \nThis is a newer material which became more popular after 2011. It is marketed as NASHA Dx, Zuidex, or Solesta. As of 2022, NASHA Dx is the only material approved in the US by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This material is composed of crosslinked dextranomer (dextran) microspheres and non-animal stabilized sodium hyaluronate (NASHA) in phosphate-buffered 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The particles are 120 µm in diameter. The material is non-allergenic, non-immunogenic and non-migratory. After injection, the hyaluronic acid is degraded, and soft tissue fibrosis forms with ingrowth of fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, blood vessels and collagen. This means that even though the particles undergo degradation, the bulking effects may persist. There are several publications which report the use of this material. They used submucosal injection site via the transmucosal route. Uncertainty about indications, cost, and durability of the material in the long term stopped widespread adoption of this material.\n\nCalcium hydroxylapatite\nMarketed as \"Coaptite\", this is spherical particles of calcium hydroxylapatite ceramic suspended in a sodium carboxylmethylcellulose, glycerine and water carrier gel. This is a synthetic version of a compound that is a normal component of bones and teeth. It is non-antigenic and noninflammatory. The particle size is in the range 75–125 µm and therefore should avoid migration away from the implant site.  Once in place, the particles are enmeshed in a non-encapsulated stable soft collagen matrix. This matrix maintains volume even after the solid particles have been degraded and resorbed. The material is radio-opaque (and therefore will be visible on x-rays). It has been used in dental and orthopedic reconstructive surgery, and for replacement heart valves. In the field of plastic surgery, it is termed Radiance FNTM. As of 2022 only one publication exists. The material was used in submucosal injection site via transsphincteric route. \n\nGAX (glutaraldehyde cross-linked) collagen\nGAX (glutaraldehyde cross-linked) collagen is purified collagen from cow skin, marketed as Contigen. Enzymes are used to remove telopeptides, which reduces the antigenicity (the degree to which the body's immune cells will be able to recognize the material as a foreign body). About 5% of patients will have an immune reaction to this material, therefore allergy testing is carried out before the final procedure. There is also a concern about disease transmission. This material contains 95% collagen Type I and 1-5% of collagen Type III. Chemical cross-linking with glutaraldehyde is intended to stop the degradation of the material by collagenases. The carrier solution is physiological saline with phosphate. The material does not seem to be associated with formation of granulomas or migration, however it is subject to degradation over time. In publications is has been used with submucosal injection site via transmucosal route. This material has not achieved widespread use.\n\nPorcine dermal collagen\nCross-linked porcine dermal collagen matrix (collagen from pig skin) has been used, marketed as Permacol. It consists of large particles of cross-linked porcine dermal collagen. It has been used for urinary incontinence and for facial contour augmentation, as well as for FI. It is biocompatible, non-allergenic and has improved durability due to revascularization and cell ingrowth following injection. In several publications where the material was used for FI, submucosal or intersphincteric injection site was used, via the transmucosal or intersphincteric routes.  \n\nHydrogel cross‐linked with polyacrylamide\nMarketed as Bulkamid, this material is a synthetic non-particulate hydrogel composed of water and cross-linked polyacrylamide (2.5%). The size of the molecules is large which makes it resistant to migration. Since it is a non particulate homogeneous hydrogel, it is thought to retain elasticity and does not lead to hard tissue fibrosis or cause other significant reaction in the surrounding tissues. It is non-resorbable and non allergenic. In plastic surgery it is marketed as Aquamid. In one publication where it was used for FI, intersphincteric injection site was used via the intersphincteric route. This material has not achieved widespread use.\n\nAluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA)\nALTA injection is somewhat different to the other materials because it is a sclerosant (i.e. it is a type causes sclerosis, or hardening of tissue). Therefore, it may be technically classified as a type of sclerotherapy. This injectable material has been used for treatment of grade III to IV prolapsed internal hemorrhoids, where it gives effects similar to hemorrhoidectomy. It has also been used for treatment of rectal prolapse and rectocele. The material causes a local inflammatory reaction, followed by sclerosis and retraction of tissues. This results in a chronic granulomatous inflammatory process and persistant fibrosis. When used to treat rectal prolapse or mucosal prolapse, it is injected into a wider area (not just into the hemorrhoid cushions, but also into parts of the rectal mucosa), leading to thickening and toughening of the anal canal and rectal wall. This has been shown to increase the maximal resting pressure of the anal canal. Therefore, the result is thought to be similar to other injectable bulking agents, although it is claimed that there is no risk of dissipation and no need for repeated procedures. ALTA has the advantage that it may be used to treat related anorectal conditions which would be contraindications for other injectable bulking agents.\n\nEthylene vinyl alcohol co-polymer in dimethyl sulfoxide\n8% ethylene vinyl alcohol co-polymer in dimethyl sulfoxide solution has been used. For FI it is marketed as Onyx34, and for gastroesophageal reflux disease it is marketed as Enteryx. After injection, it forms a spongy solid mass via solidification of the hydrophobic copolymer. This occurs because the co-polymer is hydrophic, and the solvent is dissolved away upon contact with tissues. In one publication inter-sphincteric injection site was used via the inter-sphincteric route.\n\nStem cells\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and muscle-derived stem cells (MDSC) have been used in urology to treat urinary incontinence. Fibroblasts in a collagen carrier were injected into the submucosa of the urethra, and myoblasts were injected into the urethral sphincter. The procedure was reported as being successful in most cases. Injection of MSCs may lead to engrafting and forming multinucleated myotubes, which helps to regeneration after injury. In theory, use of stem cells removes the problems of reabsorption and migration of the bulking material. There is similar research which aims to regenerate muscles and repair tissues by cell therapy to treat injuries of the external anal sphincter.\n\nGatekeeper and Sphinkeeper implants\n\nThe \"Gatekeeper\" and \"Sphinkeeper\" are related procedures. They are self-expandable prostheses which are implanted into the inter-sphincteric space of the anal canal using an applicator gun. Gatekeeper is a solid polyacrylonitrile (hyexpan) cylinder which expands to approximately 720% original size within 24 hours after the implantation.\n\nComplications\nOne review of 23 publications involved a total of 889 patients reported an overall rate of complications of 18%.\n\nReported complications are mostly minor, and include: bleeding, perianal pain / discomfort (which may rarely be persistent), leakage of injected material, infection / abscess (which rarely may require drainage), mucosal erosion, obstructed defecation, hypersensitivity reaction, hematoma, diarrhea, pruritus ani, dermatitis, and bowel urgency (sudden strong urge to defecate). \n\nEffectiveness\nA landmark randomized placebo control trial on NASHA Dx was published in 2011 in the Lancet. 136 were given real injections and 70\npatients were given shame (fake) injections. 80% of the patients had no improvement 1 month after the procedure, and were given a second injection. After 6 months, 52% of patients who received real injections had improved symptoms. The placebo treatment gave over 30% improvement in symptoms, suggesting that patient psychology (i.e. the placebo effect) may be in part responsible for any positive results. 6% of patients who received real injections were fully continent after 6 months. After publication of this study, the material was approved by the FDA in the USA in 2012. The material was aggressively marketed, and became popular for a time because of its potential as an in office treatment with low risks compared to other surgical options. However uncertainty about indications, cost, and long term durability stopped widespread adoption.\n\nA Cochrane systematic review of the efficacy of this type of treatment for FI was updated in 2013. The review included 5 randomized trials, which in total was 382 patients. 4 of the trials were assessed as uncertain or high risk of bias. Another commentator drew attention to the fact that all existing research on these procedures was driven by the companies who also marketed the treatments, and therefore the studies are indeed at high risk of bias. Another author in 2008 raised concern that 2 randomized placebo controled trials had been conducted, but their results remained unpublished for unknown reasons. None of the studies in the Cochrane review reported long term follow up after 3, 6 or 12 months post procedure. Another problem with some of the trials is that they were too small. \n\nThe Cochrane review found that most trials reported short term improvement following the procedure, regardless of which material was used. In some studies in the control groups, even placebo (sham) injections and saline injections lead to patients reporting improvement. One trial showed that dextranomer (NASHA Dx) was more effective six months after the procedure compared to placebo for just over half of patients. Another study showed that PTQ has some advantages and was safer than Durasphere in the short term. The authors concluded that due to the small amount of research available and its methodological weaknesses, further conclusions could not be made, especially regarding the long term effectiveness of the procedure.  \n\nAnother review which aimed to focus on the long term impact of the procedure included 889 patients across 23 studies. It reported a pooled improvement rate in measures of incontinence of 39.5%, on average 2 years after the procedure. In some cases there was no improvement after the procedure, and the injections needed to be repeated in up to 34% of cases. There can also be worsening of symptoms after an initial improvement period.\n\nA randomized trial by Dehli et al. compared perianal injectable bulking agents to sphincter training and biofeedback, and found the former to be superior. Both methods lead to an improvement of FI, but comparisons of St Mark's scores between the groups showed no difference between treatments.\n\nAnal manometry is sometimes used to investigate changes in the anal canal before and after the procedure. Usually mean anal resting pressure and mean anal squeeze pressure are the parameters used. Improvements in these measurements are often, but not always reported up to 3–12 months after the procedure. These improvements are not always maintained after 12 months. The length of the anal canal has also been reported to increase following the procedure. In one report, dextranomer did not increase anal resting or squeeze pressures. In the same study, dextranomer injections were found to be no different to biofeedback. \n\nThere is limited research available on this topic, and these publications are mostly of poor quality. Apart from the available research, most of the claims of benefit of these procedures is anecdotal.\n\nOne author criticized these procedures, stating that simply narrowing the anal canal was an instinctive and naïve solution which does not consider the complex pathopysiological mechanisms of FI. They suggested that these treatments are in theory suitable only for passive and minor forms of FI. Concerns have been raised about migration of the particles (in the case of Durasphere) away from the site of injection, or the total resorption of the material (in the case of hyaluronic acid and hydroxyl coaptite). Most research suggests that the positive effects of most of the bulking agents seem to reduce after 6 to 12 months. Endoanal ultrasound has sometimes been used to assess the presence of the material at follow up. At 6 months the material has been reported as missing or migrated in 18.4% of cases, at 3 years or more in 20.2% of cases. NASHA Dx and ALTA injection may have longer lasting effects, with most patients still having improvement after 3 years.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:Colorectal surgery\nCategory:Incontinence",

        "content": "Perihelion Summer is a science fiction novella/novel by Australian writer Greg Egan, published by Tor Books in 2019.\n\n Plot \nTaraxippus, a double system of two black holes with the heavier one having one-tenth the mass of the sun, is discovered using gravitational lensing and observing its Einstein rings. It passes through the Solar System and shifts the orbits of the planets. Earth in particular is thrown onto a more elliptical orbit with roughly ten to fifteen degrees more and less while passing through its perihelion and aphelion. Countries prepare, for example by enclosing entire cities under a glass dome or opening borders for refugees. Matt and his friends build the Mandjet, a boat with a self-sustaining ecosystem to stay off land and potentially head to Antartica. They meet other boats at sea, take people on board if needed and form a flotilla together. Matt hears of a fire in his hometown Perth and heads back to save his parents and sister, who all previously deemed staying at sea to be too unsafe. He arrives one hour after his father died of a heart attack, which was fatal as he previously concealed the necessity for a hospital while the family fleed Perth. He also learns that his mother blames him for it and even for Taraxippus, as he didn't stop talking about it. Matt can bring his mother and sister to the Mandjet successfully, but learns it has been taken over by invaders. Together with his friends, they manage to gain control again. Matt is then forgiven by his mother.\n\n Reviews \nRussell Letson writes in the Locus Magazine, that the novella \"is certainly more than 'just a ride': a description of how wrong things can go and how fast, a hard-SF, procedural-didactic treatment that follows its disaster from causes through effects and responses, supported by the meticulously precise observations of processes one expects from this writer.\" He also adds that the \"early chapters also sketch in the range of social and political reactions\" and that \"the rest of the book unpacks the implications of political pathologies and clima­tological disturbances as populations face or flee the deadly extremes of ice and fire.\" He further thinks that \"Egan always insists on examining and unfold­ing the way the world works and the ways we interact with those operations\", that the novella \"also models the rational, the possible, the decent, and the humane in its picture, as though reluctant to give in to the most melodramatic options offered by the situation\" and that Egan is \"modeling both an accelerated version of the future we face and a perhaps-as-unlikely kind of response to it – a rational and humane refusal to give up or give in to survivalist power fantasies and magical thinking.\"\n\nKirkus Reviews called the story \"more an appetizer than an entree\" as well as \"more than a novella yet less than a novel\" and further wrote \"In a series of quick, vivid sketches, Egan shows us how, for those aboard the Mandjet and their friends and relatives still on land, life—the entire planet—will change forever. As a metaphor representing global climate change, it's effective enough; more than 30 years ago, another Australian, George Turner, did something comparable in Drowning Towers. This lacks that book's weight and complexity, though it's certainly a noteworthy contribution to a debate whose implications Egan is content to leave to our imaginations.\"\n\nReferences\n\n External links \n\n \n\nCategory:2019 Australian novels\nCategory:Novels by Greg Egan\nCategory:Australian science fiction novels\nCategory:2019 science fiction novels\nCategory:Hard science fiction",

The new shoots and young twigs are clothed in very fine pale or white hairs, and leaves are simple (undivided) and without lobes or teeth on the margins. They are arranged in opposite pairs on the twigs, on petioles up to  long. Leaves are ovate to elliptic and measure up to  long by  wide.

He chose the species epithet sessilis due to the plant having sessile flowers and fruit.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nRhodamnia sessiliflora is restricted to coastal and subcoastal parts of northeastern Queensland, extending from about Rossville south to the Paluma Range National Park. It grows in well developed rainforest and monsoon forest on various soils, at altitudes from near sea level to about .\n\nEcology\nFruit of this tree are eaten by cassowaries (Casuarius casuarius), figbirds (Sphecotheres vieilloti), spotted catbirds (Ailuroedus maculosus) and Lewin's honeyeaters (Meliphaga lewinii).\n\nDiseases and conservation\nAs a plant in the Myrtaceae family, this species is susceptible to the introduced pathogen Puccinia psidii — commonly known as myrtle rust — and is in rapid decline.

One of the recommendations proposed by the committee included established specialised schools in mathematics, science, sports, and the arts, to diversify the education landscape. As such, on 12 August 2003, the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (abbreviated as MITA, now known as MDDI) appointed Lee Tzu Yang as chairman of the Arts School Committee, to study the needs and feasibility of establishing a specialised school in arts.\n\nOn 12 March 2004, the Report of the Committee on Specialised Arts School was presented to MITA. The recommendation of establishing a specialised school in arts was accepted by MITA, and announced in the 10th Parliament of Singapore on the next day.\n\nAuditions for places in the inaugural intake began in November 2006, and due to an overwhelming response, more auditions were held up until July 2007. In total, more than 1,000 students attended the auditions.\n\nOn 2 January 2008, Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts Lee Boon Yang officiated the opening of SOTA at its interim campus at 90 Goodman Road, with more than 200 students forming the inaugural batch. The first principal was Rebecca Chew, former principal of Naval Base Secondary School.\n\nOn 5 July 2012, SOTA signed a memorandum of understanding with Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA), allowing students to transfer to NAFA and complete diploma and degree programmes in a shorter amount of time.\n\n Admissions \nAdmissions to SOTA is conducted solely via the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme for secondary schools, and around 200 students are admitted in each intake. From 2010 onwards, SOTA also joined the DSA scheme for junior colleges, admitting a small group of students to its Year 5 cohort.\n\n Curriculum \nSOTA offers a six-year International Baccalaureate (IB) arts and academic curriculum, leading to a IB Diploma Programme (IBDP) or IB Career-related Programme (IBCP). The first batch of IBDP and IBCP students graduated in 2012 and 2015 respectively.\n\nIn 2011, SOTA partnered with Louis Vuitton to develop a visual arts programme as part of the curriculum, benefiting more than 60 visual arts students.\n\nAnnounced on 6 June 2022, IB collaborated with SOTA to develop a new literary arts course, as part of the school-based syllabus under the IB Group 6 subjects. The course was introduced for teaching from January 2023, and will begin assessments in November 2024.\n\n Campus \nThe  campus is located at 1 Zubir Said Drive in Bras Basah, along the foot of Mount Sophia. Announced by acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts Lui Tuck Yew on 8 May 2009, the address of the campus was named in honour of Zubir Said.\n\nCosting S$145 million, construction of the permanent campus was completed in 2009, and SOTA moved in on 4 January 2010.\n\n Notable alumni \nRegina Song – Singaporean singer-songwriter\n\n Principals \nName of PrincipalYears ServedRebecca Chew2008–2012Lim Geok Cheng2013–2018Mary Seah2019–present\n\n References \n\n External links \n\n ",

First introduced by Brussels' MIVB in 2008, it has since has expanded to include the public transport operators NMBS, De Lijn, and TEC. Each operator issues a MOBIB card with a unique design, but it can be used with all four operators. Transport tickets are usually specific to each operator, though some subscriptions, such as 'Brupass' and 'Brupass XL', are valid across multiple operators.\n\nThe card contains a near-field communication (NFC) tag and is compatible with the ISO 7816 contact interface. It can store up to eight tickets, including single trips, multi-trip passes, and subscriptions. Additionally, bicycle-sharing (like Villo! and Blue-Bike), car-sharing (such as Cambio), and station parking subscriptions can also be loaded onto the card.\n\nUnlike the Dutch OV-chipkaart, the MOBIB card is not a stored-value card and therefore does not support loading a monetary balance.

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facility_Requirements_Based_on_Sex_Act",
        "content": "The Facility Requirements Based on Sex Act, also known as Committee Substitute for House Bill 1521 (CS/HB 1521), is a 2023 Florida anti-trans bathroom law which mandates that individuals must use restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities that correspond to their sex assigned at birth in in some public, some state-licensed, and private college-run student housing facilities and private colleges. It is the most populous state in the United States with a bathroom law. The law has generated significant controversy and legal challenges. \n\nHistory\nPrior to July 1, 2023, transgender people in Florida were never mandated to use public restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities that correspond to their sex assigned at birth in public buildings and private educational institutions that receive state funding. In 2015, the Kentucky Senate passed a bathroom bill, which would have required people to use bathrooms corresponding to their biological sex in public schools and public facilities, but died in the Kentucky House of Representatives in committee without a vote.\n\nIn 2016, North Carolina enacted the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, which required transgender individuals in public buildings to use bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to their biological sex as stated on their birth certificates, rather than their gender identity.There was no penalty or enforcement mechanisms for violating the requirement in the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act. On March 30, 2017, the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act was repealed following public backlash. In 2017, the Texas Senate passed a bathroom bill, which would restrict bathroom use based on biological sex in both public schools and government buildings, but died in the Texas House of Representatives in committee without a vote.\n\nIn 2019, the South Dakota Legislature passed a bathroom bill, which included provisions related to bathroom access based on biological sex in certain public facilities, but it was vetoed by Governor Dennis Daugaard. From 2021 to 2022, bathroom laws for public schools were enacted in Tennessee, Alabama and Oklahoma. Prior to March 7, 2023, state legislatures in Arkansas and Tennessee, along with the Idaho House of Representatives, the Kentucky Senate and the Oklahoma Senate passed bathroom bill for public schools, while the North Dakota House of Representatives passed a bathroom bill which requires government entities to restrict restroom access based on biological sex.\n\n Legislative history \n\nOn March 7, 2023, House Bill 1521 (HB 1521), a bill which would require public facilities, including restrooms and changing facilities, to be designated for exclusive use based on a person's sex at birth, with certain exceptions, and impose penalties for violations, was introduced in the Florida House of Representatives (FL House) by Representative Rachel Plakon. On March 29, 2023, House Regulatory Reform & Economic Development Subcommittee adopted, by a vote of 11-3, Amendment 808359, which clarified restroom and changing facility requirements, ensuring that facilities were designated based on biological sex with specific exceptions for unisex facilities, caregiving, and emergency situations. On April 19, 2023, the FL House passed, by a vote of 80-37, HB 1521. On May 2, 2023, Amendment 730228, which introduced key changes to HB 1521, was passed by a voice vote in the Florida Senate (FL  Senate).\n\nAmendment 730228 allowed for the creation of unisex restrooms and changing facilities as alternatives to sex-designated facilities, provided they meet specific privacy standards. Additionally, it clarified exceptions for entering facilities designated for the opposite sex, including caregiving, law enforcement, emergency situations, and maintenance activities. The amendment also introduced a requirement for covered entities to establish disciplinary procedures for violations of the act, including measures for staff and inmates or students who refuse to comply with facility-use rules.\n\nFurthermore, Amendment 730228 authorized the Florida Attorney General to bring civil enforcement actions against entities failing to comply, with fines of up to $10,000 for willful violations. Lastly, a severability clause was included to ensure the act’s provisions remain enforceable even if certain sections are found invalid. On May 3, 2023, at 2:23 PM ET, the FL Senate passed, by a vote of 26-12, HB 1521. That same day, at 3:56 PM ET, the Florida House concurred with Amendment 730228 and passed, by a vote of 80-36, HB 1521. On May 17, 2023, Governor Ron DeSantis signed HB 1521 into law, which took effect on July 1, 2023.\n\nProvisions\nThe following facility restrooms, locker rooms and changing facilities are covered by the Facility Requirements Based on Sex Act:\n\n Private facilities\nApproximately 23.5% are private facilities covered. The Facility Requirements Based on Sex Act is unique in that is the the only state with a  bathroom law that explicitly applies to some private facilities.\n\n College-run student housing (since April 1, 2024)\n Colleges (since April 1, 2024)\n Correctional institutions (since April 1, 2024)\n Universities (since April 1, 2024)\n\n Public facilities\nApproximately 52.9% are public facilities covered.\n\n College-run student housing (since April 1, 2024)\n Colleges (since April 1, 2024)\n Correctional institutions (since April 1, 2024)\n Domestic violence centers\n Healthcare facilities\n K-12 schools\n Shelters\n State government buildings with restrooms or changing facilities\n Universities (since April 1, 2024)\n\n State-licensed facilities\nApproximately 64.7% are state-licensed facilities covered. The Facility Requirements Based on Sex Act is unique in that is the the only state with a bathroom law that explicitly applies to some state-licensed facilities.\n\n Assisted living facilities\n Domestic violence centers\n Healthcare facilities\n Massage establishments\n Optical establishments\n Shelters\n State colleges (since April 1, 2024)\n State universities (since April 1, 2024)\n Pain management clinics\n Pharmacies\n Substance abuse treatment facilities\n\nExtension\nIn August 2023, the Florida Board of Education applied these restrictions of the Facility Requirements Based on Sex Act to private colleges and universities. On September 20, 2023, the Florida Board of Governors extended the enforcement of the act to cover all state universities. This expansion requires universities to designate restrooms and changing facilities for males and females based on their biological sex at birth, with unisex options provided where necessary. Non-compliance by university staff may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. Private colleges, private universities and state universities are required to submit documentation proving compliance by April 1, 2024.\n\n Penalties \n\nThe following penalties apply to individuals and institutions that fail to comply with the Facility Requirements Based on Sex Act's requirements:\n\n If an individual willingly enters a restroom or changing facility designated for the opposite sex and refuse to leave when asked commit trespass in a structure or conveyance, which is classified as a second-degree misdemeanor, which has a maximum penalty of up to 60 days in jail and a fine of up to $500.\n Educational institutions, correctional facilities, detention centers, and public agencies are required to establish internal disciplinary procedures for staff, students, or inmates who violate the bill's provisions. Penalties for violating those procedures may include suspension, termination, or other appropriate disciplinary measures according to the institution's policies.\n Covered entities that fail to comply with the law may face civil actions initiated by the Florida Attorney General. The Attorney General can seek injunctive relief and impose fines of up to  $10,000 per violation for willful non-compliance.\n\nExceptions\n\nThe following exceptions are listed in the Facility Requirements Based on Sex Act:\n\n Assisting someone who needs help due to age, disability, or medical reasons.\n Providing medical aid or emergency care.\n Responding to an emergency.\n For cleaning, maintenance, or inspection when the facility is not in use.\n If the assigned restroom is broken or under repair and the opposite one is empty.\n Excludes students and school staff from the trespassing rule.\n Excludes juveniles and staff from the trespassing rule in juvenile facilities.\n Excludes public employees from the trespassing rule in public buildings.\n Excludes individuals receiving treatment for intersex conditions (disorders of sexual development) under a doctor’s care.\n\n Enforcement \nCurrently there have been no publicly reported arrests or prosecutions under the Facility Requirements Based on Sex Act.\n\n Lawsuits \nShortly after the law was signed, several lawsuits were filed challenging its constitutionality. The most prominent lawsuit was filed by a coalition of transgender individuals and advocacy groups in September 2023. The plaintiffs argue that the law violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments by discriminating against transgender people and infringing on their rights to privacy and freedom of expression.WUSF News, \"Florida Bathroom Law Faces Court Challenge\"\n\nThe lawsuit is still pending, but legal experts predict that the case could set a national precedent regarding bathroom access for transgender individuals.\n\nExternal links\n Facility Requirements Based on Sex Act\n\n See Also \n Bathroom bill\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:2024 controversies in the United States\nCategory:2024 in LGBT history\nCategory:LGBT history in Florida\nCategory:Florida statutes\nCategory:Political controversies in the United States\nCategory:Restrooms in the United States\nCategory:Sex segregation\nCategory:LGBT rights in Florida\nCategory:Legal discrimination against transgender people in the United States",
