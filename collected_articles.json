        "content": "Sierra National Forest is a U.S. national forest located on the western slope of the central Sierra Nevada in California, bounded on the northwest by Yosemite National Park and on the south by Kings Canyon National Park. The forest is known for its mountain scenery and beautiful lakes. Forest headquarters are located in Clovis, California. There are local ranger district offices in North Fork and Prather.\n\nHistory\nSierra National Forest was the second National Forest created in California and the largest at the time. It covered over six million acres (24,000 km2) of the Sierra Nevada and was about four times the average area of typical California National Forests. Originally it embraced parts of eight counties from Tuolumne on the north to Kern on the south and Mono and Inyo on the east. Initially its name was descriptive, but later when the Sierra was divided into different units this was no longer the case.\nPresident Benjamin Harrison proclaimed the Sierra Forest Reserve on February 14, 1893. Four years later the south half became a separate unit and was named Sierra South during the \"forest reserves\" era. This designation was dropped after the administrative transition to the National Forests on March 4, 1907. On July 1, 1908, the Sequoia National Forest, and Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks were established from this south portion of Sierra National Forest. Eastern portions of Sierra National Forest became the Inyo and Toiyabe National Forests; northern portions were used for Yosemite National Park and the Stanislaus National Forest.\nThe Sierra National Forest contains artifacts dating back over 10,000 years, mainly from indigenous people before written records started about 150 years ago. Around the late 1700s, the Fresno River marked the area between the Southern Sierra Miwok and the Chukchansi Yokuts, with the Western Mono living near today's Bass Lake. The borders between these groups were not clear-cut, showing that the Miwok, Yokuts, and Mono territories often overlapped.\nThe first timber sale on a California National Forest took place in the Sierra NF by the United States General Land Office in 1899.\n\nGeography\nSierra National Forest covers, in descending order of forestland area, the eastern portions of Fresno, Madera, and Mariposa counties, adjacent to the southern part of Yosemite National Park. It includes more than 1,300,000 acres (2,000 sq mi; 5,300 km2), at altitudes ranging from 900 to 13,986 feet (274 to 4,263 m) in elevation. The terrain includes rolling, oak-covered foothills, heavily forested middle elevation slopes and the tundra landscape of the High Sierra.\n\nBoundaries\nThe forest's boundary starts clockwise at the intersections of the Merced River, Sweetwater Creek and HWY 140, then moves east following the Merced River canyon to the border with Yosemite National Park near El Portal. Then it follows the park's southern boundary until it reaches the Inyo National forest near Electra Peak. From there it travels south to its border with Kings Canyon National Park near Mount Goethe. It follows the park's northern border, then heads south to the Kings River near Deer Canyon. From there it moves down the Kings River canyon east; south of the river is the Sequoia National Forest. When it reaches Pine Flat Lake near Trimmer, it turns north towards Tollhouse and continues on to Auberry. From there Sierra National Forest moves on to North Fork, then west to form a small finger towards Coarsegold. Finally, the boundary travels north to Yosemite Forks and moves west towards Miami Mountain, then heads north to return to the Merced River.\n\nRecreation\nThe forest includes a number of scenic attractions, including Fresno Dome and Nelder Grove. Several reservoirs offer fishing and boating, including Bass Lake, Shaver Lake, Wishon Reservoir, and Courtright Reservoir. There are numerous hiking opportunities in wilderness areas: Ansel Adams, John Muir, Dinkey Lakes, Kaiser, and Monarch. There is also a ski resort, China Peak, that operates under a special use permit. Great sailing opportunities exist at Huntington Lake.\n\nAdministration\nThe Sierra National Forest is located within the Pacific Southwest region of the US Forest Service. The forest is divided into three ranger districts:\nBass Lake Ranger District is north and west of the San Joaquin River. Its Ranger District office is located at 57003 Road 225 North Fork, California, 93643. The district includes 36 camp sites, 17 picnic sites, 7 Off Highway Vehicle Trails, and 10 trails. It includes the Forest Service Offices of Oakhurst (40343 Hwy 41, Oakhurst, California 93644), and the Clover Meadow Wilderness Office.\nHigh Sierra Ranger District is south and east of the San Joaquin River; it has its Ranger District office out of 29688 Auberry Rd P.O. Box 559 Prather, California 93651. This district contains 30 camp sites, 11 picnic sites, and 13 Off Highway Vehicle Trails. It also includes the following Forest Service Offices; the High Sierra visitor information station near Mono Hot Springs on the Kaiser Pass Road, Eastwood visitor information center at Hwy 168 and Kaiser Pass Road at Huntington Lake, Dinkey Creek visitor information center on Dinkey Creek Road near the Dinkey Creek Campground,\nSupervisor's Office (an administrative Unit) contains the Sierra National Forest Supervisor's office (1600 Tollhouse Rd Clovis, California, 93611); the Yosemite Sierra Visitor Bureau (40343 Highway 41, Oakhurst, California 93644); and the Fresno Air Attack Base which is co-located with the Sierra National Forest Emergency Communications Center (2307 and 2309 N Clovis Ave, Fresno, California 93727) at Fresno Yosemite International Airport.\nIn addition, the forest has a close relationship with the Teakettle Experimental Forest which is deep inside the forest and the San Joaquin Experimental Range which is just outside the forest boundaries. They both fall in the Pacific Southwest Research Station which is based in Berkeley, California.\n\nEcology\nThe ecology of the National Forest is typical for the western side of the southern Sierra Nevada: distributions of species are largely governed by climate, which is strongly dependent on altitude. The ecology can be described by biotic zones, which are marked by either a tree indicator species, or by a lack of trees. The biotic zones include the foothill woodland zone from 1,000 to 3,000 feet (300 to 910 m) (interior live oak), the lower montane zone from 3,000 to 7,000 feet (910 to 2,130 m) (Ponderosa pine), the upper montane zone from 7,000 to 9,000 feet (2,100 to 2,700 m) (lodgepole pine/red fir), the subalpine zone from 9,000 to 9,500 feet (2,700 to 2,900 m) (whitebark pine), and the alpine zone from 9,500 feet (2,900 m) (above the tree line).\nSome 383,000 acres (598 sq mi; 1,550 km2) of the forest are old growth, containing lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and red fir (Abies magnifica).\n\nNational monument proposal\nA campaign to designate the national forest as a national monument was begun in 2015. The proposal for the 1,400,000-acre (5,700 km2) Range of Light National Monument would prevent new mining operations and phase out logging and grazing, resulting in a continuous protected area linking Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon national parks. Former Sequoia National Park ranger Deanna Lynn Wulff founded the organization Unite the Parks to campaign for the monument's establishment. The proposal has been endorsed by numerous local businesses and organizations, a group of 200 scientists, the California Democratic Party, Democratic National Committee, Sierra Club, and the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks. The protection of old-growth trees would contribute to the 30 by 30 initiative. It is opposed by Congressman Tom McClintock and the logging industry.\nIn December 2022, Congressmembers Jackie Speier and Jerry McNerney introduced a bill that would establish Range of Light National Monument comprising the entirety of Sierra National Forest and the San Joaquin Gorge managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The new national monument would be administered by the National Park Service, which would manage land for conservation rather than multiple-use.\nUnite the Parks has also led a lawsuit to prevent logging in fisher habitat.\n\nSee also\nList of national forests of the United States\nCreek Fire\nFerguson Fire\nRailroad Fire\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nUSDA Forest Service: Sierra National Forest website"

        "content": "Jeremy Bernard Corbyn (; born 26 May 1949) is a British politician who has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Islington North since 1983. An independent, Corbyn was a member of the Labour Party from 1965 until his expulsion in 2024, and is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group parliamentary caucus. He served as Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Labour Party from 2015 to 2020. Corbyn identifies ideologically as a socialist on the political left.\nBorn in Chippenham, Wiltshire, Corbyn joined the Labour Party as a teenager. Moving to London, he became a trade union representative. In 1974, he was elected to Haringey Council and became Secretary of Hornsey Constituency Labour Party until elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included Anti-Fascist Action, the Anti-Apartheid Movement, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and advocating for a united Ireland and Palestinian statehood. As a backbencher, Corbyn routinely voted against the Labour whip, including New Labour governments. A vocal opponent of the Iraq War, he chaired the Stop the War Coalition from 2011 to 2015, and received the Gandhi International Peace Award and Seán MacBride Peace Prize. Following Ed Miliband's resignation after the party had lost the 2015 general election, Corbyn won the 2015 party leadership election to succeed him. The Labour Party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.\nTaking the party to the left, Corbyn advocated renationalising public utilities and railways, a less interventionist military policy, and reversals of austerity cuts to welfare and public services. Although he had sometimes been critical of the European Union (EU), he supported the Remain campaign in the 2016 EU membership referendum. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016 through a leadership challenge, he won a second leadership contest against Owen Smith. Despite hostile treatment from the media, in the 2017 general election Corbyn led Labour to increase its vote share by 10 percentage points to 40 per cent, their largest rise since the 1945 general election. During his tenure as leader, Corbyn was criticised for the antisemitism within the party. He condemned antisemitism and apologised for its presence, while his leadership saw a strengthening of disciplinary procedures regarding hate speech and racism. In 2019, after deadlock in Parliament over Brexit, Corbyn endorsed holding a referendum on the withdrawal agreement, with a personal stance of neutrality. In the 2019 general election, Labour's vote share fell to 32 per cent, leading to a loss of 60 seats, leaving it with 202, its fewest since the 1935 general election. Corbyn remained Labour leader for four months while the leadership election to replace him took place. His resignation as Labour leader formally took effect in April 2020 following the election of Keir Starmer, who led the party to victory at the next general election in 2024.\nAfter asserting that the scale of antisemitism had been overstated for political reasons, Corbyn was suspended from the party in 2020. In May 2024, after the 2024 general election had been called, Corbyn was not allowed to stand as a Labour candidate for his constituency, and subsequently announced he would stand as an independent candidate for Islington North; he was then expelled from Labour. He won re-election with a majority of 7,247.\n\nEarly life\nJeremy Bernard Corbyn was born on 26 May 1949 in Chippenham, Wiltshire, the son of mathematics teacher Naomi Loveday (née Josling; 1915–1987) and electrical engineer and power rectifier expert David Benjamin Corbyn (1915–1986). He has three elder brothers; one of them, Piers Corbyn (born 1947), is a weather forecaster who later became known as a climate change denier and anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist. For the first seven years of his life, the family lived in Kington St Michael, Wiltshire. His parents were Labour Party members and peace campaigners who met in the 1930s at a committee meeting in support of the Spanish Republic at Conway Hall during the Spanish Civil War.\nWhen Corbyn was seven, the family moved to Pave Lane, Shropshire, where his father bought Yew Tree Manor, a 17th-century farmhouse which was once part of the Duke of Sutherland's Lilleshall estate. Corbyn attended Castle House School, an independent preparatory school near Newport, Shropshire, before becoming a day student at Newport's Adams Grammar School at the age of 11.\nWhile still at school, Corbyn became active in the League Against Cruel Sports and the Labour Party Young Socialists within The Wrekin. He joined the Labour Party at the age of 16. He achieved two A-Levels at grade E, the lowest possible passing grade, before leaving school at 18. Corbyn joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in 1966 while at school and later became one of its three vice-chairs and subsequently vice-president. Around this time, he also campaigned against the Vietnam War.\nAfter school, Corbyn worked briefly as a reporter for the local Newport and Market Drayton Advertiser newspaper. Around the age of 19, he spent two years doing Voluntary Service Overseas in Jamaica as a youth worker and geography teacher. He subsequently visited Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay throughout 1969 and 1970. While in Brazil, he participated in a student demonstration in São Paulo against the Brazilian military government. He also attended a May Day march in Santiago, where the atmosphere around Salvador Allende's Popular Unity alliance which swept to power in the Chilean elections of 1970 made an impression on him: \"[I] noticed something very different from anything I had experienced... what Popular Unity and Allende had done was weld together the folk tradition, the song tradition, the artistic tradition and the intellectual tradition\".\n\nEarly career and political activities\nReturning to the UK in 1971, Corbyn worked as an official for the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers. He began a course in Trade Union Studies at North London Polytechnic but left after a year without a degree after a series of arguments with his tutors over the curriculum. He worked as a trade union organiser for the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE) and Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, where his union was approached by Tony Benn and \"encouraged ... to produce a blueprint for workers' control of British Leyland\"; the plans did not proceed after Benn was moved to a different Department.\nCorbyn was appointed a member of a district health authority and in early 1974, at the age of 24, he was elected to Haringey Council from South Hornsey ward. After boundary changes in 1978 he was re-elected in Harringay ward as councillor, remaining so until 1983. As a delegate from Hornsey to the Labour Party Conference in 1978, Corbyn successfully moved a motion calling for dentists to be employed by the National Health Service (NHS) rather than as private contractors. He also spoke in another debate, describing a motion calling for greater support for law and order as \"more appropriate to the National Front than to the Labour Party\".\nCorbyn became the local Labour Party's agent and organiser, and had responsibility for the 1979 general election campaign in Hornsey.\nAround this time, he became involved with the London Labour Briefing, where he was a contributor. Described by The Times in 1981 as \"Briefing's founder\", The Economist in a 1982 article named Corbyn as \"Briefing's general secretary figure\", as did a profile on Corbyn compiled by parliamentary biographer Andrew Roth in 2004, which states that he joined the editorial board as General Secretary in 1979. Michael Crick, in the 2016 edition of his book Militant, says that Corbyn was \"a member of the editorial board\", as does Lansley, Goss and Wolmar's 1989 work The Rise and Fall of the Municipal Left. Corbyn said in 2017 that these reports were inaccurate, telling Sophy Ridge: \"I read the magazine. I wrote for the magazine. I was not a member of the editorial board. I didn't agree with it.\"\nHe worked on Tony Benn's unsuccessful deputy leadership campaign in 1981. Corbyn was keen to allow former International Marxist Group member Tariq Ali to join the party, despite Labour's National Executive having declared him unacceptable, and declared that \"so far as we are concerned ... he's a member of the party and he'll be issued with a card.\" In May 1982, when Corbyn was chairman of the Constituency Labour Party, Ali was given a party card signed by Corbyn; in November, the local party voted by 17 to 14 to insist on Ali's membership \"up to and including the point of disbandment of the party\".\nIn the July 1982 edition of Briefing, Corbyn opposed expulsions of the Trotskyist and entryist group Militant, saying that \"If expulsions are in order for Militant, they should apply to us too.\" In the same year, he was the \"provisional convener\" of \"Defeat the Witch-Hunt Campaign\", based at Corbyn's then address. The Metropolitan Police's Special Branch monitored Corbyn for two decades, until the early 2000s, as he was \"deemed to be a subversive\". According to the Labour Party, \"The Security Services kept files on many peace and Labour movement campaigners at the time, including anti-Apartheid activists and trade unionists\".\n\nParliamentary backbencher (1983–2015)\nLabour in opposition (1982–1997)\nCorbyn was selected as the Labour Party candidate for the constituency of Islington North, in February 1982, winning the final ballot for selection by 39 votes against 35 for GLC councillor Paul Boateng, who in 1987 became one of the first three Black British Members of Parliament (MP). At the 1983 general election he was elected MP for the constituency, defeating the Independent Labour incumbent Michael O'Halloran, and immediately joined the socialist Campaign Group, later becoming secretary of the group.\nShortly after being elected to Parliament, he began writing a weekly column for the left-wing Morning Star newspaper. In May 2015, he said that \"the Star is the most precious and only voice we have in the daily media\". In February 2017, the Morning Star said of Corbyn: \"He has been bullied, betrayed and ridiculed, and yet he carries on with the same grace and care he always shows to others – however objectionable their behaviour and treatment of him might be.\"\nIn 1983, Corbyn spoke on a \"no socialism without gay liberation\" platform and continued to campaign for LGBT rights.\nHe was a campaigner against apartheid in South Africa, serving on the National Executive of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, and was arrested in 1984 while demonstrating outside South Africa House, leading, decades later, to a viral image of Corbyn being arrested circulated by supporters on social media. This was as a member of the City of London Anti-Apartheid Group (CLAAG) who carried out a \"non-stop picket\" for 1,408 days to campaign for Nelson Mandela's release from prison. The Anti-Apartheid Movement did not support this protest, as they had agreed not to demonstrate within 30 feet of the embassy, and the picket failed to gain support from the London ANC; Mandela's failure to respond to CLAAG following his release from prison in 1990 is frequently described as a 'snub'.\nHe supported the 1984–85 miners' strike. In 1985, he invited striking miners into the gallery of the House of Commons; they were expelled for shouting: \"Coal not dole\". At the end of the strike Corbyn was given a medallion by the miners in recognition of his help.\nIn 1985, he was appointed national secretary of the newly launched Anti-Fascist Action.\nDuring the BBC's Newsnight in 1984, Conservative MP Terry Dicks said that so-called Labour \"scruffs\" (such as Corbyn, who at this time was known for wearing an old polo-necked sweater to the Commons) should be banned from addressing the House of Commons unless they maintained higher standards. Corbyn responded, saying that: \"It's not a fashion parade, it's not a gentleman's club, it's not a bankers' institute, it's a place where the people are represented.\"\nIn 1990, Corbyn opposed the poll tax (formally known as the Community Charge) and nearly went to jail for not paying the tax. He appeared in court the following year as a result.\nCorbyn supported the campaign to overturn the convictions of Jawad Botmeh and Samar Alami for the 1994 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in London which argued that there was insufficient evidence to tie them to the act, along with Amnesty International, Unison and a number of journalists and other MPs. Botmeh and Alami had admitted possessing explosives and guns but denied they were for use in Britain. The convictions were upheld by the High Court of Justice in 2001 and by the European Court of Human Rights in 2007.\nCorbyn sat on the Social Security Select Committee from 1992 to 1997.\n\nIrish politics\nA longstanding supporter of a united Ireland, in the 1980s Corbyn met Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams a number of times. Corbyn consistently stated that he maintained links with Sinn Fein in order to work for a resolution to the armed conflict. According to The Sunday Times, Corbyn was involved in over 72 events connected with Sinn Féin or other pro-republican groups during the period of the IRA's paramilitary campaign.\nCorbyn met Adams at the 1983 and 1989 Labour conferences (facilitated by pro-IRA Red Action) and in 1983 at Westminster, along with a number of other Labour MPs. In 1984, Corbyn and Ken Livingstone invited Adams, two convicted IRA volunteers and other members of Sinn Féin to Westminster. He was criticised by the Labour Party leadership for the meeting, which took place two weeks after the IRA's bombing of the Conservative Party leadership that killed five people.\nDuring the 1980s he campaigned on behalf of the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six, who were wrongly convicted of responsibility for IRA bombings in England in the mid-1970s. In 1986, Corbyn was arrested with 15 demonstrators protesting against what they saw as weak evidence and poor treatment during the trial of a group of IRA members including Patrick Magee, who was convicted of the Brighton hotel bombing and other attacks. After refusing police requests to move from outside the court, Corbyn and the other protesters were arrested for obstruction and held for five hours before being released on bail, but were not charged.\nIn 1987, Corbyn attended a commemoration by the Wolfe Tone Society in London for eight IRA members who were killed by Special Air Service soldiers while attacking a Royal Ulster Constabulary police station in Loughgall, County Armagh. At the commemoration, he told his fellow attendees that \"I'm happy to commemorate all those who died fighting for an independent Ireland\" and attacked the British government's policies in Northern Ireland, calling for all British troops to be withdrawn from the region. Corbyn subsequently said that he had attended the event, which included a minute of silence for the eight IRA members, to \"call for a peace and dialogue process\".\nHe voted against the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, saying \"We believe that the agreement strengthens rather than weakens the border between the six and the 26 counties, and those of us who wish to see a United Ireland oppose the agreement for that reason.\"\nIn the early 1990s, MI5 opened a file on Corbyn to monitor his links to the IRA.\nIn 1994, Corbyn signed a Commons motion condemning the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings, which killed 21 people.\nA short time after IRA plans to bomb London were foiled in 1996, Corbyn invited Adams to the House of Commons for a press conference to promote Adams' autobiography, Before the Dawn. Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam and Labour leader Tony Blair condemned the invitation, with Mowlam arguing that it was detrimental to the peace process, and Blair threatening disciplinary action. Adams cancelled the event, to save further embarrassment to Corbyn and to avoid negative publicity.\nIn 1998, he voted for the Good Friday Agreement, saying he looked forward to \"peace, hope and reconciliation in Ireland in the future.\"\nIn 2017, Corbyn said that he had \"never met the IRA\", although Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott later clarified that although he had met members of the IRA, \"he met with them in their capacity as activists in Sinn Fein\".\n\nLabour in government (1997–2010)\nBetween 1997 and 2010, during the New Labour governments, Corbyn was the Labour MP who voted most often against the party whip, including three-line whip votes. In 2005 he was identified as the second most rebellious Labour MP of all time during the New Labour governments. He was the most rebellious Labour MP in the 1997–2001 Parliament, the 2001–2005 Parliament and the 2005–2010 Parliament, defying the whip 428 times while Labour was in power. Jacobin described him as \"a figure who for decades challenged them [Labour Party elites] from the backbench as one of the most rebellious left-wing members of parliament\".\nCorbyn has called for Tony Blair to be investigated for alleged war crimes during the Iraq War. In July 2016, the Chilcot Report of the Iraq Inquiry was issued, criticising Blair for joining the United States in the war against Iraq. Subsequently, Corbyn – who had voted against military action against Iraq – gave a speech in Westminster commenting: \"I now apologise sincerely on behalf of my party for the disastrous decision to go to war in Iraq in March 2003\" which he called an \"act of military aggression launched on a false pretext\" something that has \"long been regarded as illegal by the overwhelming weight of international opinion\". Corbyn specifically apologised to \"the people of Iraq\"; to the families of British soldiers who died in Iraq or returned injured; and to \"the millions of British citizens who feel our democracy was traduced and undermined by the way in which the decision to go to war was taken on.\"\nCorbyn sat on the London Regional Select Committee from 2009 to 2010.\n\nStop the War Coalition and anti-war activism\nIn October 2001, Corbyn was elected to the steering committee of the Stop the War Coalition, which was formed to oppose the War in Afghanistan which started later that year. In 2002, Corbyn reported unrest : \"there is disquiet...about issues of foreign policy\" among some members of the Labour party. He cited \"the deployment of troops to Afghanistan and the threat of bombing Iraq\" as examples. He was vehemently opposed to Britain's involvement in the Iraq War in 2003, and spoke at dozens of anti-war rallies in Britain and overseas. He spoke at the February anti-Iraq War protest which was said to be the largest such protest in British political history. At the same time, he expressed support for the Iraqi insurgency and the Palestinian intifada when he signed the second Cairo Declaration in December 2003, which said \"The Iraqis themselves are now engaged in a titanic struggle to rid their country of occupying forces. The Palestinian intifada continues under the most difficult circumstances. The US administration threatens Iran and other countries on a daily basis. Now is the time to draw together the forces of resistance in the Arab world and from around the globe.\"\nIn 2006, Corbyn was one of 12 Labour MPs to support Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party's call for a parliamentary inquiry into the Iraq War. He was elected chair of the coalition in succession to Andrew Murray in September 2011, but resigned once he became Leader of the Labour Party in September 2015.\n\nParliamentary groups and activism\nCorbyn is a member of a number of Parliamentary Trade Union Groups: he is sponsored by several trade unions, including UNISON, Unite and the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. He is a supporter of the Unite Against Fascism pressure group. Corbyn was chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on the Chagos Islands, chair of the APPG on Mexico, Vice-Chair of the APPG on Latin America and vice-chair of the APPG on Human Rights. He has advocated for the rights of the forcibly removed Chagossians to return to the British Indian Ocean Territory.\n\nCorbyn appeared on a call-in show on Press TV, an Iranian government television channel, several times between 2009 and 2012. He was criticised for appearing on the channel in light of Iran executing and imprisoning homosexuals, as well as Corbyn not questioning contributors who called the BBC \"Zionist liars\" and described Israel as a \"disease\". Corbyn said in response that he used the programme to address \"human rights issues\" and that his appearance fee was \"not an enormous amount\" and was used to help meet constituency office costs. Corbyn's final appearance was six months after the network was fined by Ofcom for its part in filming an interview with Maziar Bahari, an Iranian journalist, saying the interview had been held under duress and after torture.\n\nLabour in opposition (2010–2015)\nIn the 2010 Labour Party leadership election, Corbyn supported Diane Abbott in the first round in which she was eliminated; thereafter, he supported Ed Miliband.\nCorbyn was one of 16 signatories to an open letter to Ed Miliband in January 2015 calling for Labour to make a commitment to opposing further austerity, to take rail franchises back into public ownership, and to strengthen collective bargaining arrangements.\nCorbyn sat on the Justice Select Committee from 2010 to 2015. Before becoming party leader Corbyn had been returned as member of Parliament for Islington North seven times, gaining 60.24% of the vote and a majority of 21,194 in the 2015 general election.\n\nLeadership elections\nFollowing the Labour Party's defeat at the general election on 7 May 2015, Ed Miliband resigned as its party leader, triggering a leadership election. Corbyn decided to stand as a candidate, having been disillusioned by the lack of a left-wing voice, and said to his local newspaper, The Islington Tribune, that he would have a \"clear anti-austerity platform\". He also said he would vote to scrap the Trident nuclear weapons system and would \"seek to withdraw from Nato\". He suggested that Britain should establish a national investment bank to boost house-building and improve economic growth and lift wages in areas that had less investment in infrastructure. He would also aim to eliminate the current budget deficit over time and restore the 50p top rate of income tax. He added: \"This decision is in response to an overwhelming call by Labour Party members who want to see a broader range of candidates and a thorough debate about the future of the party. I am standing to give Labour Party members a voice in this debate\". He indicated that, if he were elected, policies that he put forward would need to be approved by party members before being adopted and that he wanted to \"implement the democratic will of our party\". The other candidates were Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham and Shadow Care Minister Liz Kendall. Several who nominated Corbyn later said they had ensured he had enough votes to stand, more to widen the political debate within the party than because of a desire or expectation that he would win.\nAt the Second Reading of the Welfare Reform and Work Bill in July 2015, Corbyn joined 47 Labour MPs to oppose the Bill, describing it as \"rotten and indefensible\", whilst the other three leadership candidates abstained under direction from interim leader Harriet Harman. In August 2015, he called on Iain Duncan Smith to resign as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions after it was reported that thousands of disabled people had died after being found fit to work by Work Capability Assessments (instituted in 2008) between 2011 and 2014, although this was challenged by the government and by FullFact who said that the figure included those who had died and therefore their claim had ended, rather than being found fit for work.\nCorbyn rapidly became the frontrunner among the candidates and was perceived to benefit from a large influx of new members. Hundreds of supporters turned out to hear him speak at the hustings across the nation and their enthusiastic reception and support for him was dubbed \"Corbynmania\" by the press. Membership numbers continued to climb after the start of his leadership. In addition, following a rule change under Miliband, members of the public who supported Labour's aims and values could join the party as \"registered supporters\" for £3 and be entitled to vote in the election. There was speculation that the rule change would lead to Corbyn being elected by registered supporters without majority support from ordinary members. He was elected party leader in a landslide victory on 12 September 2015 with 59.5% of first-preference votes in the first round of voting. He would have won in the first round with 51% of votes, even without \"£3 registered supporters\", having gained the support of 49.6% of full members and 57.6% of affiliated supporters. His 40.5% majority was a larger proportional majority than that attained by Tony Blair in 1994. His margin of victory was said to be \"the largest mandate ever won by a party leader\".\nAn internal Labour Party report, entitled The work of the Labour Party's Governance and Legal Unit in relation to antisemitism, 2014–2019, was leaked to the media in April 2020. The report stated that during the 2015 and 2016 leadership contests, staff members at Labour party headquarters looked for ways to exclude from voting members who they believed would vote for Corbyn. The staff members referred to this activity as \"trot busting\", \"bashing trots\" and \"trot spotting\".\n\nCorbynmania\nCorbyn was initially viewed as a token candidate for the left wing of the party and not expected to win. However, many new, young party members, who had joined after the membership fee had been reduced to £3, were attracted by what they saw as Corbyn's authentic, informal style and radical policies. Hundreds of supporters turned out to hear him speak at the hustings across the nation and their enthusiastic reception and support for him was dubbed \"Corbynmania\" by the press.\nJonathan Dean characterised Corbynmania as a political fandom, comparable with the enthusiastic followings of popular media stars and other modern politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Justin Trudeau. Specific features included use of the #jezwecan hashtag, attendance at rallies and the posting of pictures such as selfies on social media. Artistic, merchandising and other activity consolidated and spread this fannish enthusiasm. This included a \"Jeremy Corbyn for Prime Minister\" (JC4PM) tour by celebrities such as Charlotte Church, Jeremy Hardy and Maxine Peake; a Corbyn superhero comic book; mash-ups and videos. Many of Corbyn's supporters felt he possessed personal qualities such as earnestness and modesty leading them to develop a sense of emotional attachment to him as individual. These were seen as cultish by critics such as Margaret Beckett who said in 2016 that the Labour Party had been turned into the \"Jeremy Corbyn Fan Club\".\nA chant of \"Oh, Jeremy Corbyn\" was adopted as an anthem or chorus by his supporters. Sung in the style of a football chant to the tune of a riff from \"Seven Nation Army\" by The White Stripes, it attracted special attention at the Glastonbury Festival 2017, where Corbyn appeared and spoke to the crowds. Labour's weaker-than-expected performance in the 2018 local elections led to suggestions that Corbynmania had peaked.\n\nLeadership of the Labour Party (2015–2020)\nFirst term as Leader of the Opposition (2015–2017)\nAfter being elected leader, Corbyn became Leader of the Official Opposition and shortly thereafter his appointment to the Privy Council was announced. In Corbyn's first Prime Minister's Questions session as leader, he broke with the traditional format by asking the Prime Minister six questions he had received from members of the public, the result of his invitation to Labour Party members to send suggestions, for which he received around 40,000 emails. Corbyn stressed his desire to reduce the \"theatrical\" nature of the House of Commons, and his début was described in a Guardian editorial as \"a good start\" and a \"long overdue\" change to the tone of PMQs. He delivered his first Labour Party Conference address as leader on 29 September 2015. Party membership nearly doubled between the May 2015 election and October 2015, attributed largely to the election as leader of Corbyn.\nIn September 2015 an unnamed senior serving general in the British Army stated that a mutiny by the Army could occur if a future Corbyn government moved to scrap Trident, pull out of Nato or reduce the size of the armed forces. The general said \"the Army just wouldn't stand for it. The general staff would not allow a prime minister to jeopardise the security of this country and I think people would use whatever means possible, fair or foul to prevent that. You can't put a maverick in charge of a country's security\".\nIn July 2016, a study and analysis by academics from the London School of Economics of national newspaper articles about Corbyn in the first months of his leadership of Labour showed that 75% of them either distorted or failed to represent his actual views on subjects.\n\n2017 general election\nThe Labour campaign in the 2017 general election focused on social issues such as health care, education and ending austerity. Corbyn's election campaign was run under the slogan \"For the Many, Not the Few\" and featured rallies with a large audience and connected with a grassroots following for the party, including appearing on stage in front of a crowd of 20,000 at the Wirral Live Festival in Prenton Park. \nAlthough Labour started the campaign as far as 20 points behind, and again finished as the second largest party in parliament, it increased its share of the popular vote to 40%, resulting in a net gain of 30 seats and a hung parliament. This was its greatest vote share since 2001. It was the first time Labour had made a net gain of seats since 1997, and the party's 9.6% increase in vote share was its largest in a single general election since 1945. This was partly attributed to the popularity of its 2017 Manifesto that promised to scrap tuition fees, address public sector pay, make housing more affordable, end austerity, nationalise the railways and provide school students with free lunches.\n\n2019 general election and resignation\nIn May 2019, Theresa May announced her resignation and stood down as prime minister in July, following the election of her replacement, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Corbyn said that Labour was ready to fight an election against Johnson.\n\nThe 2019 Labour Party Manifesto included policies to increase funding for health, negotiate a Brexit deal and hold a referendum giving a choice between the deal and remain, raise the minimum wage, stop the age pension age increase, nationalise key industries, and replace universal credit. Due to the plans to nationalise the \"big six\" energy firms, the National Grid, the water industry, Royal Mail, the railways and the broadband arm of BT, the 2019 manifesto was widely considered as the most radical in several decades, more closely resembling Labour's politics of the 1970s than subsequent decades.\nDuring the campaign for the upcoming general elections, Corbyn was accused by the Hindu Council UK of promoting anti-Hindu sentiments following his disparaging comments on the caste system & his condemnation of the Hindu-right wing Bharatiya Janata Party led Indian government's revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Many Hindus living in the UK saw Corbyn's attitude towards Hindus to be heavily influenced by Pakistani Muslim leaders of his party, with whom he shared a common pro-Palestinian stance.\nThe 2019 general election was the worst defeat in seats for Labour since 1935, with Labour winning just 202 out of 650 seats, their fourth successive election defeat. At 32.2%, Labour's share of the vote was down around eight points on the 2017 general election and is lower than that achieved by Neil Kinnock in 1992, although it was higher than in 2010 and 2015. In the aftermath, opinions differed to why the Labour Party was defeated to the extent it was. The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell largely blamed Brexit and the media representation of the party. Tony Blair argued that the party's unclear position on Brexit and the economic policy pursued by the Corbyn leadership were to blame.\nFollowing the Labour Party's unsuccessful performance in the 2019 general election, Corbyn conceded defeat and stated that he intended to step down as leader following the election of a successor and that he would not lead the party into the next election. Corbyn himself was re-elected for Islington North with 64.3% of the vote share and a majority of 26,188 votes over the runner-up candidate representing the Liberal Democrats, with Labour's share of the vote falling by 8.7%. The Guardian described the results as a \"realignment\" of UK politics as the Conservative landslide took many traditionally Labour seats in England and Wales. Corbyn insisted that he had \"pride in the manifesto\" that Labour put forward and blamed the defeat on Brexit. According to polling by Lord Ashcroft, Corbyn was himself a major contribution to the party's defeat. Corbyn remained Labour leader for four months while the leadership election to replace him took place. His resignation as Labour leader formally took effect in April 2020 following the election of Keir Starmer.\n\nPost-leadership\nEHRC report and suspension\nAllegations of antisemitism within the party grew during Corbyn's leadership. Incidents involving Naz Shah in 2014 and Ken Livingstone in 2016 resulted in their suspension from party membership pending investigation. In response, Corbyn established the Chakrabarti Inquiry, which concluded that while the party was not \"overrun by anti-Semitism or other forms of racism,\" there was an \"occasionally toxic atmosphere\" and \"clear evidence of ignorant attitudes.\"\nIn 2017, Labour Party rules were amended to categorize hate speech, including antisemitism, as a disciplinary matter. In 2018, Corbyn faced scrutiny for his response in 2012 to an allegedly antisemitic mural and for his association with Facebook groups, mainly pro-Palestinian, containing antisemitic posts. Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) adopted a definition of antisemitism, for disciplinary purposes, in July of that year, aligning with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) Working Definition, with modified examples related to criticism of Israel. In September 2018, the NEC incorporated all 11 IHRA examples, unamended, into the party's code of conduct. In May 2019, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) launched an inquiry into whether Labour had \"unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish.\" After asserting that the scale of antisemitism had been overstated for political reasons, Corbyn was suspended from the party in 2020.\nThe Forde Report, written by lawyer Martin Forde in response to the dossier that was leaked in April 2020 (The work of the Labour Party's Governance and Legal Unit in relation to antisemitism, 2014–2019), was released on 19 July 2022, stating that: \"[R]ather than confront the paramount need to deal with the profoundly serious issue of anti-Semitism in the party, both factions treated it as a factional weapon.\" It also described senior Labour staff as having displayed \"deplorably factional and insensitive, and at times discriminatory, attitudes\" towards Corbyn and his supporters, and detailed concerns by some staff about a \"hierarchy of racism\" in the party which ignored Black people. The report also expressed regret that Corbyn himself did not engage with the authors' request to interview him.\nResponding to this, Corbyn's former advisor Andrew Fisher wrote: \"Forde confirms that reflection is necessary. Cultural change requires painstaking work, not glib assertions of change.\" Corbyn himself stated that report \"calls into question the behaviour of senior officials in the party, in particular during the 2017 election\" and that \"wrongs must be righted.\"\n\nPeace and Justice Project\nOn 13 December 2020, Corbyn announced the Project for Peace and Justice. Corbyn launched the project on 17 January 2021, and its affiliates include Christine Blower, Len McCluskey and Zarah Sultana. Rafael Correa said that he \"welcome[d] the creation\" of the project.\n\nStop the War Coalition statement on Ukraine crisis\nOn 18 February 2022, in the week before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Corbyn alongside 11 Labour MPs cosigned a statement from the Stop the War Coalition opposing any war in Ukraine. The statement said that \"the crisis should be settled on a basis which recognises the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination and addresses Russia's security concerns\", that NATO \"should call a halt to its eastward expansion\", and that the British government's sending of arms to Ukraine and troops to eastern Europe served \"no purpose other than inflaming tensions and indicating disdain for Russian concerns\". The statement's authors also said that they \"refute [sic] the idea that NATO is a defensive alliance\".\nOn the evening of 24 February, the first day of the invasion, Labour chief whip Alan Campbell wrote to all 11 Labour MPs who had signed the statement, requesting that they withdraw their signatures. All 11 agreed to do so the same evening. Corbyn and fellow former Labour independent MP Claudia Webbe did not withdraw their signatures from the statement, though David Lammy urged Corbyn to do so.\n\nExpulsion from the Labour Party and 2024 general election\nMedia speculation that Corbyn would contest the 2024 general election as an Independent was reported in October 2023. Despite \"unanimous support\" from his Constituency Labour Party (CLP), Corbyn was not permitted to stand as a Labour parliamentary candidate. After announcing on 24 May 2024 that he would stand as an independent parliamentary candidate for Islington North, he was fully expelled from the Labour Party. He was endorsed by Mick Lynch of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers.\nCorbyn responded to Keir Starmer's claim of knowing the party would lose the 2019 election by saying \"Well, he never said that to me, at any time. And so I just think rewriting history is no help. It shows double standards, shall we say, that he now says he always thought that but he never said it at the time or anything about it. He was part of the campaign. He and I spoke together at events and I find it actually quite sad.\"\nA poll released just over two weeks before the election showed Corbyn in second behind Labour candidate Praful Nargund. Leading members of the Islington North CLP resigned in order to support Corbyn, while also criticising the manner in which Nargund was selected as Islington North's candidate. Corbyn was comfortably re-elected as an independent, even as Labour won a landslide victory in the general election. His majority over Nargund was over 7,000.\n\nPolicies and views\nCorbyn self-identifies as a socialist. He has also been referred to as a \"mainstream [Scandinavian] social democrat\". He advocates reversing austerity cuts to public services and some welfare funding made since 2010, as well as renationalisation of public utilities and the railways. A longstanding anti-war and anti-nuclear activist, he supports a foreign policy of military non-interventionism and unilateral nuclear disarmament, and has been a prominent activist for Palestinian solidarity throughout the Gaza–Israel conflict. Writer Ronan Bennett, who formerly worked as a research assistant to Corbyn, has described him as \"a kind of vegan, pacifist idealist, one with a clear understanding of politics and history, and a commitment to the underdog\".\nIn 1997, the political scientists David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh described Corbyn's political stance as \"far-left\". Corbyn has described Karl Marx as a \"great economist\" and said he has read some of the works of Adam Smith, Marx and David Ricardo and has \"looked at many, many others\". However, some have argued that Corbyn is less radical than previously described: for example, the journalist George Eaton has called him \"Keynesian\". In 2023, The Daily Telegraph reported that most of the tax policies in Corbyn's 2019 general election manifesto had been implemented by the winning Conservative government, including a higher corporation tax, a windfall tax on oil companies, a reduction in annual tax allowances on dividend income, raising income tax on high earners, and introducing a digital services tax on online retailers.\nCorbyn named John Smith as the former Labour leader whom he most admired, describing him as \"a decent, nice, inclusive leader\". He also said he was \"very close and very good friends\" with Michael Foot.\n\nMedia coverage\nAnalyses of domestic media coverage of Corbyn have found it to be critical or antagonistic. In July 2016, academics from the London School of Economics published a study of 812 articles about Corbyn taken from eight national newspapers around the time of his Labour leadership election. The study found that 75 percent of the articles either distorted or failed to represent his actual views on subjects. The study's director commented that \"Our analysis shows that Corbyn was thoroughly delegitimised as a political actor from the moment he became a prominent candidate and even more so after he was elected as party leader\".\nAnother report by the Media Reform Coalition and Birkbeck College in July 2016, based on 10 days of coverage around the time of multiple shadow cabinet resignations, found \"marked and persistent imbalance\" in favour of sources critical to him; the International Business Times was the only outlet that gave him more favourable than critical coverage.\nIn August 2016, a YouGov survey found that 97% of Corbyn supporters agreed that the \"mainstream media as a whole has been deliberately biasing coverage to portray Jeremy Corbyn in a negative manner\", as did 51% of the general \"Labour selectorate\" sample.\nIn May 2017, Loughborough University's Centre for Research in Communication and Culture concluded that the media was attacking Corbyn far more than May during nine election campaign weekdays examined. The Daily Mail and Daily Express praised Theresa May for election pledges that were condemned when proposed by Labour in previous elections.\nIn February 2018, Momentum reported that attacks on Corbyn in the press were associated with increases in their membership applications. In September 2019, Labour leaders argued that traditional mainstream media outlets showed bias.\nIn December 2019, a study by Loughborough University found that British press coverage was twice as hostile to Labour and half as critical of the Conservatives during the 2019 general election campaign as it had been during the 2017 campaign.\nIn an interview with Middle East Eye in June 2020, Corbyn described the media's treatment of himself while he was Labour leader as obsessive and \"at one level laughable, but all designed to be undermining\". He said that the media coverage had diverted his media team from helping him pursue \"a political agenda on homelessness, on poverty in Britain, on housing, on international issues\" to \"rebutting these crazy stories, abusive stories, about me the whole time\". He said he considered suing as a result of media treatment but was guided by advice from Tony Benn, who told him, \"Libel is a rich man's game, and you're not a rich man [...] Go to a libel case – even if you win the case, you'll be destroyed financially in doing so\".\n\nPersonal life\nCorbyn lives in the Finsbury Park area of London. He has been married three times and divorced twice, and has three sons with his second wife. In 1974, he married his first wife, Jane Chapman, a fellow Labour Councillor for Haringey and now a professor at the University of Lincoln. They divorced in 1979. In the late 1970s, Corbyn had a brief relationship with Labour MP Diane Abbott.\nIn 1987, Corbyn married Chilean exile Claudia Bracchitta, granddaughter of Ricardo Bracchitta (Consul-General of Spain in Santiago), with whom he has three sons. He missed his youngest son's birth as he was lecturing National Union of Public Employees members at the same hospital. Following a difference of opinion about sending their son to a grammar school (Corbyn opposes selective education), they divorced in 1999 after two years of separation, although Corbyn said in June 2015 that he continues to \"get on very well\" with her. His son subsequently attended Queen Elizabeth's School, which had been his wife's first choice. Their second son, Sebastian, worked on his leadership campaign and was later employed as John McDonnell's Chief of Staff.\nCorbyn's second-eldest brother, Andrew, who was a geologist, died of a brain haemorrhage while in Papua New Guinea in 2001. Corbyn escorted the body from Papua New Guinea to Australia, where his brother's widow and children lived.\nIn 2012, Corbyn went to Mexico to marry his Mexican partner Laura Álvarez, who runs a fair trade coffee import business that has been the subject of some controversy. A former human rights lawyer in Mexico, she first met Corbyn shortly after his divorce from Bracchitta, having come to London to support her sister Marcela following the abduction of her niece to America by her sister's estranged husband. They contacted fellow Labour MP Tony Benn for assistance, who introduced them to Corbyn, who met with the police on their behalf and spoke at fundraisers until the girl was located in 2003. Álvarez then returned to Mexico, with the couple maintaining a long-distance relationship until she moved to London in 2011. Álvarez has described Corbyn as \"not very good at house work but he is a good politician\". They have a cat called El Gato (\"The Cat\" in Spanish), while Corbyn had previously owned a dog called Mango, described by The Observer in 1984 as his \"only constant companion\" at the time.\n\nPersonal beliefs and interests\nWhen interviewed by The Huffington Post in December 2015, Corbyn refused to reveal his religious beliefs and called them a \"private thing\", but denied that he was an atheist. He has said that he is \"sceptical\" of having a god in his life. He compared his concerns about the environment to a sort of \"spiritualism\". Corbyn has described himself as frugal, telling Simon Hattenstone of The Guardian: \"I don't spend a lot of money, I lead a very normal life, I ride a bicycle and I don't have a car.\" He has been a vegetarian for nearly 50 years, after having volunteered on a pig farm in Jamaica when he was 19, and stated in April 2018 that he was considering becoming a vegan. Although he has been described in the media as teetotal, he said in an interview with the Daily Mirror that he does drink alcohol but \"very, very little\".\nCorbyn is a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Cycling. He enjoys reading and writing, and speaks fluent Spanish. He supports Arsenal F.C., which is based in his constituency, and has signed parliamentary motions praising the successes of its men's and women's teams. He named Jens Lehmann, Ian Wright, and Dennis Bergkamp as his favourite Arsenal players, and has campaigned for the club to pay its staff a living wage. Corbyn is an avid \"drain spotter\" and has photographed decorative drain and manhole covers throughout the country.\nCorbyn co-edited with Len McCluskey the anthology Poetry for the Many, published in November 2023 by OR Books.\n\nAwards and recognition\nIn 2013, Corbyn was awarded the Gandhi International Peace Award for his \"consistent efforts over a 30-year parliamentary career to uphold the Gandhian values of social justice and non‐violence\". In the same year, he was honoured by the Grassroot Diplomat Initiative for his \"ongoing support for a number of non-government organisations and civil causes\". Corbyn has won the Parliamentary \"Beard of the Year Award\" a record six times, as well as being named as the Beard Liberation Front's Beard of the Year, having previously described his beard as \"a form of dissent\" against New Labour.\nIn 2016, Corbyn was the subject of a musical entitled Corbyn the Musical: The Motorcycle Diaries, written by journalists Rupert Myers and Bobby Friedman.\nIn 2017 the American magazine Foreign Policy named Corbyn in its Top 100 Global Thinkers list for that year \"for inspiring a new generation to re-engage in politics\". In December 2017 he was one of three recipients awarded the Seán MacBride Peace Prize \"for his sustained and powerful political work for disarmament and peace\". The award was announced the previous September.\n\nSee also\nElectoral history of Jeremy Corbyn\nList of peace activists\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nJeremy Corbyn on Twitter \nCampaign website for the 2024 general election\n\nProfile at Parliament of the United Kingdom\nContributions in Parliament at Hansard\nContributions in Parliament at Hansard 1803–2005\nVoting record at Public Whip\nRecord in Parliament at TheyWorkForYou\nAppearances on C-SPAN"

        "content": "A gridiron pendulum was a temperature-compensated clock pendulum invented by British clockmaker John Harrison around 1726. It was used in precision clocks. In ordinary clock pendulums, the pendulum rod expands and contracts with changes in temperature. The period of the pendulum's swing depends on its length, so a pendulum clock's rate varied with changes in ambient temperature, causing inaccurate timekeeping. The gridiron pendulum consists of alternating parallel rods of two metals with different thermal expansion coefficients, such as steel and brass. The rods are connected by a frame in such a way that their different thermal expansions (or contractions) compensate for each other, so that the overall length of the pendulum, and thus its period, stays constant with temperature.\nThe gridiron pendulum was used during the Industrial Revolution period in pendulum clocks, particularly precision regulator clocks employed as time standards in factories, laboratories, office buildings, railroad stations and post offices to schedule work and set other clocks. The gridiron became so associated with accurate timekeeping that by the turn of the 20th century many clocks had pendulums with decorative fake gridirons, which had no temperature compensating qualities.\n\nHow it works\nThe gridiron pendulum is constructed so the high thermal expansion (zinc or brass) rods make the pendulum shorter when they expand, while the low expansion steel rods make the pendulum longer.  By using the correct ratio of lengths, the greater expansion of the zinc or brass rods exactly compensate for the greater length of the low expansion steel rods, and the pendulum stays the same length with temperature changes.  \nThe simplest form of gridiron pendulum, introduced as an improvement to Harrison's around 1750 by John Smeaton, consists of five rods, 3 of steel and two of zinc.  A central steel rod runs up from the bob to the suspension pivot.\nAt that point a cross-piece (middle bridge) extends from the central rod and connects to two zinc rods, one on each side of the central rod, which reach down to, and are fixed to, the bottom bridge just above the bob. The bottom bridge clears the central rod and connects to two further steel rods which run back up to the top bridge attached to the suspension. As the steel rods expand in heat, the bottom bridge drops relative to the suspension, and the bob drops relative to the middle bridge. However, the middle bridge rises relative to the bottom one because the greater expansion of the zinc rods pushes the middle bridge, and therefore the bob, upward to match the combined drop caused by the expanding steel.\nIn simple terms, the upward expansion of the zinc counteracts the combined downward expansion of the steel (which has a greater total length). The rod lengths are calculated so that the effective length of the zinc rods multiplied by zinc's thermal expansion coefficient equals the effective length of the steel rods multiplied by iron's expansion coefficient, thereby keeping the pendulum the same length.: p.261 \nHarrison's original pendulum used brass rods (pure zinc not being available then); these required more rods because brass does not expand as much as zinc does.  Instead of one high expansion rod on each side, two are needed on each side, requiring a total of 9 rods, five steel and four brass. The exact degree of compensation can be adjusted by having a section of the central rod which is partly brass and partly steel. These overlap (like a sandwich) and are joined by a pin which passes through both metals. A number of holes for the pin are made in both parts and moving the pin up or down the rod changes how much of the combined rod is brass and how much is steel. \nIn the late 19th century the Dent company developed a tubular version of the zinc gridiron in which the four outer rods were replaced by two concentric tubes which were linked by a tubular nut which could be screwed up and down to alter the degree of compensation.\nIn the 1730s clockmaker John Ellicott designed a version that only required 3 rods, two brass and one steel (see drawing), in which the brass rods as they expanded with increasing temperature pressed against levers which lifted the bob. The Ellicott pendulum did not see much use.: p.272-273\n\nDisadvantages\nScientists in the 1800s found that the gridiron pendulum had disadvantages that made it unsuitable for the highest-precision clocks. The friction of the rods sliding in the holes in the frame caused the rods to adjust to temperature changes in a series of tiny jumps, rather than with a smooth motion. This caused the rate of the pendulum, and therefore the clock, to change suddenly with each jump. Later it was found that zinc is not very stable dimensionally; it is subject to creep. Therefore, another type of temperature-compensated pendulum, the mercury pendulum invented in 1721 by George Graham, was used in the highest-precision clocks.: p.289 \nBy 1900, the highest-precision astronomical regulator clocks used pendulum rods of low thermal expansion materials such as invar and fused quartz.\n\nGallery\nMathematical analysis\nTemperature error\nAll substances expand with an increase in temperature \n  \n    \n      \n        θ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n  \n, so uncompensated pendulum rods get longer with a temperature increase, causing the clock to slow down, and get shorter with a temperature decrease, causing the clock to speed up.

Before 1900 most buildings were unheated, so clocks in temperate climates like Europe and North America would experience a summer/winter temperature variation of around 14 °C (25 °F) resulting in an error rate of 6.8 seconds per day.: p.259   Wood has a smaller CTE of 4.9 x 10−6 per °C thus a pendulum with a wood rod will have a smaller thermal error of 0.21 sec per day per °C, so wood pendulum rods were often used in quality domestic clocks.  The wood had to be varnished to protect it from the atmosphere as humidity could also cause changes in length.\n\nCompensation\nA gridiron pendulum is symmetrical, with two identical linkages of suspension rods, one on each side, suspending the bob from the pivot.

But in a gridiron pendulum, the gridiron constitutes a significant part of the mass of the pendulum.  This changes the moment of inertia so the center of oscillation is somewhat higher, above the bob in the gridiron.

This factor is hard to calculate accurately.

        "content": "Ngee Ann Building was a building on Orchard Road in Singapore housing both shops and apartments. Built by the Ngee Ann Kongsi and opened in 1957, the rent collected from the building enabled the organisation to establish the Ngee Ann College. It was demolished in 1985 to make way for Ngee Ann City.\n\nHistory\nThe land on which the building stood was once the Tai Shan Ting Cemetery, owned by the Ngee Ann Kongsi. The exhumations began following a ceremony on 1 September. A special shed was built for the ceremony, presided over by Buddhist priest Reverend Miao Chung of the Sam Lim Ji Temple on Kim Keat Road. Joss sticks were burnt early in the morning to \"inform the dead of the meeting\". By then, offerings had already been placed within the hut. The reverend climbed to the top of the hill within the cemetery to \"invite the dead\" to the shed. Joss sticks were then burnt and placed on the ground to \"guide the spirits from their resting places.\" Prayers were then offered to deities, after which paper money and clothes were burnt. The exhumation of the graves commenced following the conclusion of the ceremony.\nIn the same month, then-Ngee Ann Kongsi chairman Lee Wee Nam announced that there were also plans to demolish the nearby Kampong Teochew to make way for \"better class bungalow buildings.\" By October, over 4,000 graves at the cemetery had been reburied at a Chinese cemetery in Seletar. By July 1952, 15,000 out of the 20,000 graves had been exhumed. The remains were later reinterred at the Teochew Memorial Park. The granite from the tombstones and monuments of the cemetery were to be repurposed as the foundations of the new buildings. The project was initially planned to include a \"garden city\" with and a self-contained housing unit accompanied by a shopping centre, with 84 shophouses, 423 flats, 20 bungalows, a hotel, school, cinema, amusement park, electrical substation and a petrol kiosk. However, in July 1952, it was announced that the project would have to be developed by private investors and not by the Ngee Ann Kongsi as initially planned, as the trustees of the organisation were prevented by law from doing so.\nThe first phase of the plan was to see the completion of a five-storey building along Orchard Road with 40 flats and 10 shops. However, by February 1955, before tenders had been called for the project, its architect, Ng Keng Siang, had begun seeking approval from the Singapore Improvement Trust for an alteration to the plans for the first phase, which would add a floor to the building, adding 10 more flats. The project's plans were eventually revised such that it only involved a 10-storey building with 90 flats and 12 shops, as well as a hotel and restaurant next to it. The plans for an entire block of shops and flats were shelved in favour of a car park. Work on the first phase began in August 1955, with the project scheduled to be completed by 1959.\nIn October, it was announced that plans for 25 blocks of 10-storey blocks with housing and shops accompanied by car parks had been finalised, with the first building scheduled to be completed by the end of the following year. Each floor was to have four three-bedroom flats and six two-bedroom flats, all of which had servants' quarters, bathrooms and hot water. Rent for the two-bedroom flats was to range  from $320 to $400 while rent for the three-bedroom flats was to range from $420 to $500. There was to be an information office on the ground floor, as well as two automated lifts and one manipulated lift for \"servants\" in every block. The project was to cost $3 million.\nThe building was completed in the middle of 1957. In addition to shops, its ground floor also had a bank. In March, the plot of land which stood at the junction of Orchard Road and Grange Road was put up for sale, as plans made by the Kongsi to develop the land had been shelved in favour of developing the rest of the estate. The land next to the building was then leased off, with construction of the Wisma Indonesia on the site beginning in early 1962. Also in 1962, it was announced that the Ngee Ann Kongsi would be using the rent collected from the building to establish the Ngee Ann College, now known as the Ngee Ann Polytechnic, which was to begin taking in students in the following year. By then, it was collecting nearly $400,000 a year in rent. Rent was also used to fund the establishing of the Ngee Ann Kongsi Home for the Incurable Sick within two unused wards at the Trafalgar Home in 1979. The building became a \"popular place for expatriates taking long-term apartments in Orchard Road.\" The building housed The Mount D'or Cafe, which was \"among the first coffee houses to open in the town.\" The Straits Times called it \"one of the best things that has happened about town for a long time.\" The coffeehouse's interior was designed by a Swiss firm.\nIn January 1971, it was announced that the building would be demolished to make way for the Orchard Square development. The first phase of the project involved the completion of an office block and an apartment block which the tenants of the Ngee Ann Building would move into before the building's demolition. A shopping centre and a car park would then be erected on the site. In August 1975, it was announced that the building may not be demolished to make way for the project, as there had been alterations to the plans of the project, on which work had yet to begin. In May 1983, the building's tenants, which then included the Mont D'or Coffee House, the Asia Motor Company, the American Express Travel Service and Transmarco, were told to vacate the premises by 14 August. However, by then, the land on which Orchard Square was to be built on had shrunk by over three quarters and construction had yet to begin, with the original plans for the project never materialising. The remaining property was put up for sale in December 1984 with the tender document stipulating that the successful tenderer demolish the building within three months. In July of the following year, it was announced that the building's demolition was to finish by September. Ngee Ann City was opened in 1993.\n\n\n== References =="

If no presidential candidate receives a majority in the first round of voting, a runoff will take place on Sunday 24 November 2024.\n\nBackground\nIncumbent President Luis Lacalle Pou, who won the 2019 elections, cannot run again as the constitution bars a president from immediate re-election. As a result, the governing National Party has to nominate a new candidate.\nLacalle Pou took office in 2020, heading the Multicolor Coalition, a big tent political alliance formed after October 2019 first round that remains active in the 2024 elections under the name Republican Coalition. His cabinet is composed of leaders from the member parties of the coalition, which holds a majority in both chambers of Parliament, allowing it to push through various legislative initiatives despite the Broad Front opposition.\nDuring the period from 2020 to 2024, the government of Luis Lacalle Pou has faced various controversies and challenges. These have included issues related to the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic policies, corruption scandals and social issues such as education reform and security.\n\nElectoral system\nVoting in Uruguay is compulsory and extends to all citizens aged 18 and over. Those who cannot vote without a valid reason will face a fine or be sanctioned with the inability to carry out various public procedures. According to the Constitution of Uruguay, voting is not only a right of the citizen but above all, it is a duty as a citizen, as well as an obligation.\nThe President of Uruguay is elected using the two-round system, with a run-off held between the two most-voted candidates if no candidate receives 50% of the vote in the first round. The 30 members of the Senate are elected by proportional representation in a single nationwide constituency. The vice president, elected on the same ballot as the president, becomes president of the Senate, with his vote being determinant in case of tie. The 99 members of the Chamber of Representatives are elected by proportional representation in 19 multi-member constituencies based on the 19 departments. Seats are allocated using the highest averages method.\nThe elections are held using the double simultaneous vote method, whereby voters cast a single vote for the party of their choice for all three seats of Presidency, Senate and Chamber of Representatives.\n\nParties and candidates\nPresidential primaries were held on 30 June 2024 to nominate the presidential candidate for every political party. Fourteen political parties surpassed the minimum of 500 valid votes in the internal elections required by the Electoral Court to participate in the general elections. Of these fourteen, only eleven ultimately participated in these elections (the same number of parties as in the previous elections of 2019, but with different parties). \nBelow are the parties that surpassed the 2024 primary elections, listed by their results in the 2019 general elections.\n\nSummary\nCandidates in first round\nParties with parliamentary representation\nParties without parliamentary representation\nDisqualified before the first round\nParties that did not manage to gather the minimum required of 251 delegates in their National Convention before August 31 to approve their presidential ticket.\n\nWithdrew after the primaries\nDefeated in the primary elections\nCampaign slogans\nOpinion polls\nParty polling after primaries\nParty polling before primaries\nParty polling with hypothetical presidential candidates\nPresidential polling with hypothetical candidates\nSecond round\n\nNotes\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Libertad was a Spanish newspaper published in Valladolid between 1931 and 1979. Originally founded by the fascist leader Onésimo Redondo as a weekly of fascist, pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic ideology, during the Civil War it became a daily newspaper. It continued to be published until its disappearance in 1979, after the end of the Franco regime.\n\nHistory\nEarly years\nThe newspaper was originally founded by the fascist leader Onésimo Redondo as the weekly Libertad, on 13 June 1931. A group of authors who used to publish there, such as Javier Martínez de Bedoya, Carlos Fernández-Cuenca, Jesús Ercilla and Emilio Gutiérrez Palma, gathered around Redondo.\nDuring the republican period it was the main fascist publication in Valladolid, which caused it a few problems with the authorities: suspensions, fines and legal proceedings. In one of these suspensions, the publication had to be temporarily replaced – between 1932 and 1933 – by the weekly Igualdad, before circulating again. From Libertad, a strong follow-up of German Nazism was made, reaching the point of reproducing the writings of Adolf Hitler. Anti-Semitic diatribes appeared in its pages and the anti-Semitic libel Protocols of the Elders of Zion was even published in instalments. During these years it also served as the organ of the party founded by Redondo, the Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica (JCAH), and later it would also be the organ of its successor, the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (JONS). After the union of the JONS with the Spanish Falange, the magazine continued to be published with some interruptions until 20 May 1935, when it ceased to be published on the orders of the Falangist leader José Antonio Primo de Rivera – who with this measure would have sought to promote the dissemination of the weekly Arriba of Madrid.\n\nFrancoist Spain\nAfter the start of the Civil War in the summer of 1936, Libertad re-emerged as a weekly. Under the new direction of Gabriel Arias-Salgado, as of 21 August 1938, the old weekly began to be published daily. Subsequently, the newspaper became the property of FET and the JONS, and during the Franco dictatorship it became part of the so-called Movement Press as its official organ in Valladolid.\nDuring the years of Francoism, Narciso García Sánchez, Víctor Gómez Ayllón, Timoteo Esteban Vega, passed by the direction of the newspaper. In this period it was one of the three newspapers that were published in the capital of Valladolid, along with Diario Regional and El Norte de Castilla. However, unlike the others, Libertad never had very high sales among the population. In 1966, the newspaper was deficient for the public coffers. After Franco's death, it was incorporated into the state entity Media de Comunicación Social del Estado (MCSE), but the situation continued to worsen. By 1979, it had accumulated losses of almost forty-six million pesetas, and its daily print run was only 885 copies. This situation made its maintenance unsustainable and its closure was finally agreed in 1979.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBardavío, Joaquín; Sinova, Justino (2000). Todo Franco.

        "content": "Robert Middleton (born Samuel Abraham Messer; May 13, 1911 – June 14, 1977) was an American film and television actor known for his large size, beetle-like brows, and deep, booming voice (for which he was known as \"Big Bob Middleton\"), usually in the portrayal of ruthless villains.\n\nEarly years\nA native of Cincinnati, Ohio, Middleton was one of four children of a building contractor. He trained for a musical career at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nCareer\nMiddleton's career in entertainment began with a job as an announcer on WLW radio in Cincinnati. He worked steadily as a radio announcer and actor.\nOne of his early works was as the narrator of the educational film \"Duck and Cover\".  After appearing on the Broadway stage and live television, Middleton began appearing in films in 1954, and in film opposite Humphrey Bogart in The Desperate Hours (1955), Danny Kaye in The Court Jester (1955), Gary Cooper in Friendly Persuasion (1956), Richard Egan and Elvis Presley in Love Me Tender (1956), Dorothy Malone and Robert Stack in The Tarnished Angels (1958), Robert Taylor and Richard Widmark in The Law and Jake Wade (1958), and Dean Martin in Career (1959).\nMiddleton appeared in many television programs in the 1950s and 1960s, including the CBS anthology series Appointment with Adventure. He played a dishonest candidate for the United States House of Representatives in an episode of ABC's The Real McCoys, starring Walter Brennan and Richard Crenna. In the story line, Middleton falsely claimed to have previously been a farmer in a bid for the farm vote. Middleton was cast as \"The Tichborne Claimant\" in the NBC anthology series The Joseph Cotten Show. \nIn 1956, he guest starred on James Arness’s TV Western series Gunsmoke, playing the title character in the episode “Dutch George” (S1E32), a flamboyant career horse thief who was friends with Matt Dillon in their wilder younger days (this episode unveiled some of Dillon’s shadier past, once being a young man who also might have stolen, who at a yet to be revealed crossroad in life, opted to be a lawman).  He starred as Lucius Crane in 1959 in an unaired pilot episode for a detective series called The Fat Man based on a successful radio series of the same name. In 1961, he was cast as Arthur Sutro in the episode \"The Road to Jericho\" of the ABC Western series, The Rebel, starring Nick Adams, and guest-starred in the episode \"A Man of Means\" of the short-lived crime adventure-drama series The Investigators, starring James Franciscus and James Philbrook. \nMiddleton was cast in ten episodes of  the ABC family Western drama, The Monroes, with costars Michael Anderson, Jr., and Barbara Hershey. In 1963 he portrayed Josh Green in the episode \"Incident of the Mountain Man\" on CBS's Rawhide.\nAmong his several appearances in the long-running Alfred Hitchcock Presents, he portrayed a gangster in high places, Mr. Koster, in the 1956 episode \"The Better Bargain\".  In 1958, he played the villain in the first episode of NBC's Bat Masterson Western series, starring Gene Barry in the title role. He appeared in four episodes of The Untouchables, including the 2 part episode, \"The Unhired Assassin\", as Chicago mayor Anton Cermak. In 1961, he appeared in the episode \"Accidental Tourist\" on the James Whitmore ABC legal drama The Law and Mr. Jones. That same year, he portrayed the highly sympathetic but fiercely dedicated state executioner in an episode of Thriller (U.S. TV series) entitled \"Guillotine\". \nHe appeared in three episodes of Bonanza from 1960 to 1967. In 1960, Middleton guest-starred on the episode \"Death at Dawn,\" portraying the ruthless Sam Bryant. In February 1964, he starred as mountain man Grizzly Martindale on the episode \"King of the Mountain.\" Middleton made his final appearance as the wealthy C.J. Shasta on the episode \"The Greedy Ones\" in May 1967.  \nMiddleton appeared as defendant \"Judge Daniel Redmond\" in the 1963 Perry Mason episode, \"The Case of the Witless Witness\". In the early 1950s, Middleton appeared on Broadway in Ondine (1954), A Red Rainbow (1953), and The Wild Duck (1951). Other significant film roles included The Court Jester (1955) as a grim and determined knight who jousts with Danny Kaye in the famous \"pellet with the poison\" sequence, and as Edwin M. Stanton in The Lincoln Conspiracy (1977). In between, he played an array of brutish mountain men, corrupt cigar-biting town bosses and lynch mob leaders.  Middleton guest-starred on Get Smart as the KAOS villain \"The Whip\", intent on hypnotizing Agent 86 in the 1970 series finale \"I Am Curiously Yellow\".\n\nPersonal life and death\nOn July 14, 1951, Middleton married in Cincinnati; he and his wife, Roberta, separated on September 5, 1955. They had two sons, who were the subjects of a custody hearing on February 15, 1956. He sought custody in the divorce suit, charging that she had a romantic relationship with his cousin.\nMiddleton died on June 14, 1977, in Encino, California, at the age of 66.\n\nSelected Films & Television\nThe Silver Chalice (1954) – Idbash\nThe Big Combo (1955) – Police Captain Peterson\nThe Desperate Hours (1955) – Sam Kobish\nTrial (1955) – A.A.

        "content": "Bridget (Japanese: ブリジット, Hepburn: Burijitto) is a fictional character in Arc System Works's Guilty Gear video game series. Bridget first appeared in the 2002 video game Guilty Gear X2. In the series, Bridget was born male with a twin brother in a village where the birth of same-sex twins is considered bad luck; therefore, Bridget's parents named and raised Bridget as a girl to hide her identity, despite how much it pained them. In her youth, Bridget recognized their pain and set out to be a man and gain great wealth in order to disprove the superstition and to make her parents happy. After disproving the superstition, Bridget found that being a man did not make her happy, and realized that her true self was her desire to live as a woman in accordance with her gender identity.\nBridget was created as \"a cute character\" by Daisuke Ishiwatari, who wanted to vary the cast of Guilty Gear X2, where she was presented as a cross-dressing but self-identifying boy. Due to the character's appearance, Bridget was initially described as female by video game press. When they became aware of her biological sex, reviewers included Bridget on lists of best androgynous and cross-dressing characters, and debated her sexual orientation. Bridget has become a popular character among gamers, and critics have described her as \"a memorable character\" in the series. Critics praised her appearance in Guilty Gear Strive in which she realized her identity as a trans woman.\n\nConception and development\nWhen developing Guilty Gear X2, series creator Daisuke Ishiwatari was initially working on a character to replace Kliff, a character that had appeared in the first Guilty Gear. Early on, he considered a design of a young boy with a cat-themed oversized toy hammer that would \"meow\" when it struck an opponent. However, another developer proposed the idea of making a character based on an acquaintance of his, an experienced yo-yoer. Intrigued by the idea of such a weapon in a 2D fighting game due to how it moved, he changed the character's design entirely, and both bought and practiced with a yo-yo to fully understand the range of movement available. In an interview he joked that he may have spent more time with the yo-yo than drawing. However, as there was some elements he could not adapt to the fighting game character, he gave them a secondary weapon of a teddy bear. The weapon proved very difficult however, with the character having double the frames of animation\" due to the yo-yo's movements. He spent \"a very long, very frustrating time trying to get the animation to work\", rejecting many versions before studio staff made Bridget \"look natural\".\nFrom the get-go he decided Bridget would be a cross-dressing boy, and considered giving them an Osaka accent. Ishiwatari \"wanted something unconventional\" to differentiate Bridget from other fighting games' cute characters and felt it \"would be interesting to make the character a guy.\" Most of the staff meanwhile was kept unaware of Bridget's gender. He felt if they had known the animation team would have approached Bridget as a man pretending to be a woman, so instead he told them Bridget was \"a  girl without breasts\". Ishiwatari incorporated elements into Bridget's appearance to hint at their gender however, such as giving the in-game portraits a slightly masculine face. The character's androgyny was intended to give them a sense of \"charm\", despite several characters being surprised by Bridget's gender status. Ishiwatari however noted several times during development he almost abandoned the concept and was worried he may receive backlash for incorporating such a character into the game, going to lengths in the final product to emphasize that Bridget was actually male.\nThe subject matter of Bridget's gender identity was revisited years later in Guilty Gear Strive, with Ishiwatari redefining them as transgender. In the context of the game's story, Bridget had overcome the restrictions placed upon them regarding their gender, but found themselves unhappy as a man. As a result, Bridget now identifies as a woman, and uses female pronouns.\n\nDesign\nStanding 5 ft 2 in (158 cm), Bridget is a feminine young girl with neck-length blonde hair that frames her face. As Ishiwatari developed her character he incorporated various ideas into the design, wanting to express her as \"born unequal\" in a similar manner to new character Dizzy, but at the same time someone that was happy despite the world assuming they were not. To this end he gave her an \"immoral design\" of a Catholic nun's outfit, coupled large metal handcuff was placed around her waist to indicate her capability of binding others. Crosses were used on her outfit, though instead of a religious symbol they were meant to represent femininity and her status between genders. The nun's habit was expanded into a cape behind her to obscure the visibility of her movements, though her feet were given a \"bare\" silhouette to compensate. In terms of personality, Ishiwatari wanted to illustrate Bridget as a comical character, wanting to deal with the life handed to her in a positive manner and show her parents the connections she had made with others.\nWith the character's inclusion in Strive, Ishiwatari wanted to unify Bridget character design and outfit to give a sense of realism. Ishiwatari tried to avoid the disconnect a viewer would feel when seeing a character walk around in an outfit that cannot be considered normal clothing. One point in her design that he was particular about was the symbol on her head piece. Originally the male symbol ♂, he had clear intention of changing it to a transgender symbol ⚦ for Guilty Gear Strive. When drawing the roughs, where he had already drawn her with the transgender symbol, the person in charge of cleaning up the model sheets accidentally drew her with the old design's symbol, but this mistake was corrected.\n\nAppearances\nBridget was introduced in the third installment of the series, Guilty Gear X2 (2002), where she was presented as a cross-dressing boy wearing a nun's habit. Bridget was assigned male at birth, one of twin brothers named and raised by her wealthy parents as a girl in a British village. They do this to protect her and to hide her cisgender identity, since the other villagers believe that identical twins bring bad luck, and her parents were not willing to give her away. Bridget nonetheless grows up identifying as a boy. She possesses a cheerful and happy personality, which is result of her trying to not worry her parents who, unable to raise her as a boy, were in pain and felt guilt for feeling they are forcing her to live in a certain way. She even took up yo-yoing in order to show that she was happy. However, she realized the more she insisted that she was happy, the more it pained her parents. Bridget came to the conclusion that in order to free her parents from their guilt and to make them happy, she would need to live as a man and to bring home riches to disprove the superstitions. To do this, she becomes a bounty hunter who fights with her yo-yo and Roger (ロジャー, Rojā), Bridget's mechanical, oversized teddy bear. Although she makes one of her first bounties on the Gear Dizzy, she is tricked by I-No in taking fake bounties targeting other cast of characters. In one ending path, she goes to Ky to receive her bounty rewards. He points out that the targets of these fake bounties are innocent but compensates her for her troubles anyway. In a second path, Bridget finds Dizzy with May and the Jellyfish Pirates and tries to capture the Gear. However, after the fight, she finds out that Dizzy isn't a bad person and befriends her instead. In the last path, Johnny intervenes and tries to seduce Bridget but soon gets embarrassed after he realized that she is a boy.\nIn Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus (2008), despite working to become an accomplished bounty hunter, all the wanted criminals were already taken care of. In order to make ends meet, she decides to become an entertainer. Although she tries to recruit Venom for his talent at pool and I-No for her ability to play electric guitar, both refuse her suggestion. Without money, in one ending Bridget works as a waitress in Jam Kuradoberi's restaurant. In an alternate ending she returns to her birth village, finds that her twin brother has disappeared, and begins searching for him.\nBridget is also a playable character in the spin-offs Guilty Gear Isuka (2004), Dust Strikers (2006), and Judgment (2006).\nIn 2022, Bridget returned as a DLC character for Guilty Gear Strive. English promotional material such as the Strive website and Bridget's official moveset guide video avoided referring to Bridget with any pronouns. At this point of time, although she wasn't able to capture Dizzy for her bounty, she showed great talent as a bounty hunter and managed to successfully bring home a great amount of wealth. Thus, the superstition faded and freed her and her parents from this restriction. But as a result, without her original goal, and after trying to live as a man but with it not feeling right, she is left searching for another purpose. Bridget begins Strive's arcade mode storyline presenting as a boy, as Bridget identified in previous games, but is now questioning this cisgender identity. In conversations with Goldlewis Dickinson and Ky Kiske, Bridget expresses feeling unhappy but afraid of making the wrong choice, and the other characters relate to Bridget by sharing their own experiences of hiding secrets for the sake of others and of having the courage to reveal them and live as one's \"true self\", drawing a comparison to Bridget hiding her transgender identity. At the end of her hard-difficulty mode story, Bridget comes out as a woman to Goldlewis and Ky.\n\nReception\nBridget has been generally well received by fans and critics alike, both as a Guilty Gear character and in gaming as a whole. Gamasutra's Zoran Iovanovici ascribed Bridget's popularity to the fact that she was feminine despite being presented as a boy, to which Zoran was not surprised by her popularity. In a 2013 poll conducted by Arc System Works, Bridget was voted as the most popular character from the series. Eurogamer called Bridget \"one of Guilty Gear's more memorable characters\", while Kotaku's Brian Ashcraft, who called her an \"iconic character\", felt that she was both one of the most memorable characters in Guilty Gear but also gaming. Bridget received a nomination for Best LGBTQ+ Character at the Gayming Awards 2023, but lost to Lor from New Tales from the Borderlands.\nBridget has been the subject of discussion about her gender identity, even before the release of Guilty Gear Strive and confirmation that she is female rather than male, due to her feminine appearance. When she was first revealed for Guilty Gear X2, Game Watch and other sources identified Bridget as female, though the character identified as male at the time. It was clarified a month later that Bridget was a boy. When this was revealed, some fans online were disappointed, having expected a \"new cute, playable girl\". However, there was a shift in perception, with fans appreciating Bridget for being cute. The phrase \"there's no way someone this cute is a girl\" originated in a 5ch thread about Bridget, which eventually became a \"defining phrase of the otokonoko boom\". The phrase \"everybody is gay for Bridget\" also became a popular saying on the Internet. She was also regarded as a notable example of a cross-dressing character, as well as receiving praise from The Escapist for being a heroic cross-dressing player character, in contrast to more antagonistic cross-dressing and transgender characters, such as Poison.\nCritics praised Bridget's storyline in Guilty Gear Strive, in which she struggled with her gender identity and ultimately came out as a trans woman. Bridget's debut as a DLC character for Guilty Gear Strive was her first playable appearance in 10 years. Kenneth Shepard of Fanbyte speculated that her extended absence may have been due to uncertainty over how to address her backstory, which he said was presented with homophobic and transphobic tropes in her prior appearances. Her announcement prompted Josh Tolentino of Siliconera to wonder if the developers planned to change her characterization with respect to gender presentation, noting that her official biography on Arc System Works's website avoided using gendered personal pronouns. Shepard acknowledged the challenge of sorting through Bridget's complicated backstory to tell a respectful coming out narrative. Renata Price of Waypoint drew parallels between Bridget's evolution and the increasing presence and acceptance of queer players in the fighting game community. She found Bridget's circuitous path to self-acceptance to be an asset, calling it \"messy and genuine in the way that real queer stories are\". Price and Shepard connected Bridget's story to Arc System Works's recent treatment of Testament, who identified as non-binary in a prior DLC for Strive.\n\nMisinformation\nFollowing her inclusion in Guilty Gear Strive, some fans alleged that Bridget's trans identity was invented by the translation and localization team and was not present in the Japanese version of the game; additional rumors purported that she only comes out as trans in a \"bad ending\" and identifies as a cisgender man in other endings, with the implication that Goldlewis pressured her into identifying as female. Both claims were refuted by Akira Katano and Daisuke Ishiwatari in their Developer's Backyard blog. Katano stated that \"although the difficulty and story dialogue of Arcade Mode change depending on your match results, this doesn't change the main plot, nor are there alternate endings such as 'good' or 'bad' endings. The same goes for other characters' Arcade stories as well\", while Ishiwatari reaffirmed that \"[a]fter the events of Bridget's story in Arcade Mode, she self-identifies as a woman. So, as to whether 'he' or 'she' would be the correct pronoun for Bridget, the answer would be 'she'.\" Katano stated that they did expect it to be a topic of discussion and disagreement. However, they saw a lot more people misinterpreting the message they were putting out and asking for clarity. They were conflicted on stating their stance as not doing so invited an irresponsible amount of discussion. On the other hand, they also were opposed to spoiling the conclusion of her story on the official site. But after a forgery came out claiming to be an official Arc System Works response and that Bridget was still male, which was denounced by Arc System Works in an official response soon after, they felt the need to be clear on their position.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Bridget (Guilty Gear) at Wikimedia Commons"

        "content": "Daisuke Sekimoto (関本 大介, Sekimoto Daisuke) (born February 9, 1981) is a Japanese professional wrestler, currently signed to Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW) in the Strong BJ division. He is also known for his appearances in Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max. He is a three-time BJW World Strong Heavyweight Champion, while also being a former one-time NWA Pan-Pacific Premium Heavyweight Champion, one-time wXw Unified World Wrestling Champion and a two-time Zero1 World Heavyweight Champion. Other major singles championships include the BJW Heavyweight Championship, the KO-D Openweight Championship and the Strongest-K Championship. Also a successful tag team wrestler, he has held the AJPW World Tag Team Championship three times, the All Asia Tag Team Championship two times, the BJW Tag Team Championship twelve times and the KO-D Tag Team Championship two times with his most successful tag team combination being with Yuji Okabayashi.\n\nHigh school\nSekimoto played on the baseball team at Meitoku Gijuku High School, and has been labeled as one of the \"Matsuzaka Generation\" of players, even though he did not go on to become a professional baseball player. He was at the team's 1998 Summer Koshien semifinal loss against Yokohama High School, described as a \"miracle comeback\" for Yokohama, which won despite trailing 6–0 in the top of the eighth inning. Sekimoto has cited the moment that Daisuke Matsuzaka came on as a reliever for Yokohama in that game as a source of inspiration as well as a reminder to stay humble in his own wrestling career — even as a high schooler, Matsuzaka's celebrity commanded such a response from the crowd that \"the atmosphere in the ballpark changed completely\" when he took the field.\nSekimoto decided to pursue his childhood dream of becoming a professional wrestler after graduating from high school, joining Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW) on a recommendation from his baseball coach Shirou Mabuchi.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\nBig Japan Pro Wrestling (1999–present)\nDaisuke Sekimoto made his professional wrestling debut for BJW on August 10, 1999 by losing to Ryuji Ito. As is customary in professional wrestling, especially in Japan, Sekimoto lost the majority of his matches in his early career. Sekimoto would win his first match ever on March 27, 2000 when he teamed up with Daikokubo Benkei to defeat Guerrero del Futuro and Ryuji Ito. On January 28, 2001, Sekimoto teamed up with MEN's Teioh and defeated Kamikaze and Abdullah Kobayashi to become the BJW Tag Team Champions, this was the first championship Sekimoto ever held. This combination of Sekimoto and Teioh would prove to be extremely successful, along with the BJW Tag Team Championship, the pair would go on to defeat Kintaro Kanemura and Ryuji Yamakawa for the FMW/WEW Hardcore Tag Team Championship and would hold it for over one hundred days before losing the titles to Jun Kasai and The Winger on March 21, 2002. While still holding the BJW Tag Team Championship, Sekimoto challenged Daikokubo Benkei for the BJW Heavyweight Championship and on August 18, 2002 defeated him for the title which was the first singles honour of his career. Holding both the BJW Heavyweight Championship and the BJW Tag Team Championship, Sekimoto was on top of Big Japan but this would last only a short time. Cracks started to show in the relationship between Sekimoto and Teioh and on September 15, 2002 they lost the BJW Tag Team Championship to Benkei Daikokuboh & Abdullah Kobayashi. After losing the titles, Teioh turned on Sekimoto which led to a match between the two for the BJW Heavyweight Championship which took place on September 23 which Teioh won.\nWith 2003 and 2004 being mostly uneventful for Sekimoto, he started 2005 with a bang by winning the New Generation Battle Tournament by defeating HERO! in the final on January 9.

        "content": "Alexander \"Alex\" Mahone  is a fictional character portrayed by William Fichtner in the American television series Prison Break. Mahone is introduced in the premiere of the second season as a special agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, specializing in manhunts for escaped prisoners for 14 years.\nWhen the protagonist of the series, Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), successfully orchestrates the escape of eight prisoners from Fox River State Penitentiary, Mahone is assigned to spearhead the task force assembled to recapture the fugitives and manages to capture four of them. He is later arrested in Panama and imprisoned in Penitenciaría Federal de Sona in the second-season finale. Mahone manages to escape, and is coerced into taking down the Company, a secret group of multinationals which exerts an influence on the White House. An assassin is hired by the Company to murder his son, and Mahone spends the majority of season four seeking revenge.\nThe writers created Mahone's character in the second season so that there would be a fugitive pursuer who was not corrupt. When the writers saw that the number of antagonists was increasing, they decided to make him the alter ego of Scofield. The writers try to let Mahone inhabit a gray area, shifting the audience's sympathy for the character. Fichtner, attracted to the potential of the character, was cast as Mahone just one day before filming began for the second season; he signed on for only two seasons, but was convinced to appear in a third.\n\nPlot\nBackground\nMahone was born at Boardman, Ohio into an abusive family, and was repeatedly beaten by his father. After joining the military Mahone was transferred to Special Ops during the Gulf War, later becoming an FBI Special Agent. The nature of his quick advancement is questioned, and many of his files are classified.\nHe married a woman named Pamela (Callie Thorne) and they had a son, Cameron. The marriage lasts for 12 years until Mahone abruptly ends it without explanation, ordering his family out of the house.\nBefore separating from his wife Mahone pursued Oscar Shales, a murderer whom he struggled to capture; it is revealed that Mahone killed Shales and buried the body in his backyard. Fearful that his wife would discover his secret, he cuts her out of his life. Mahone is plagued with visions of Shales, which cause him to self-medicate with prescription drugs.\n\nSeason 2\nAfter eight prisoners escape from the Fox River State Penitentiary, Mahone leads the investigation to capture them. Reviewing their files, he decides to concentrate his efforts on Michael Scofield, mastermind of the breakout. He tracks the escapees to Oswego, Illinois, but they manage to escape. Mahone continues to pursue Michael and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), who are able to avoid him on several occasions. While investigating a car explosion Mahone is shown to have a drug problem, swallowing pills concealed in a pen.\nMahone eventually tracks down John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare) and David \"Tweener\" Apolskis (Lane Garrison). Mahone orders his men to shoot Abruzzi to death when he fails to surrender, and later murders Tweener in cold blood. When he returns to his office, Mahone is questioned by Internal Affairs Agent Richard Sullins (Kim Coates) about their suspicious deaths.\nIt is revealed that Mahone was being blackmailed by Paul Kellerman (Paul Adelstein), a Secret Service agent forced to work for the Company. Kellerman threatens to reveal that Mahone killed Shales, and forces him to kill all the escapees in exchange for his silence. Although hesitant, Mahone agrees when an operative of the Company, Agent Kim (Reggie Lee), threatens to murder his family. Mahone continues his hunt for the remaining six escapees but is betrayed and shot by Kellerman, who transfers his allegiance to the brothers. He survives and decides to stop chasing the escapees, but is forced to resume his search when his son is injured in a car accident orchestrated by one of Kim's agents. Before returning to work, he murders the agent who arranged the accident. Mahone returns to his FBI field office, where he is informed by Agent Wheeler (Jason Davis) that Internal Affairs is investigating him.\nWhen Charles \"Haywire\" Patoshik (Silas Weir Mitchell) murders a civilian, Mahone asks Brad Bellick (Wade Williams) (former captain of correctional officers at Fox River) to help him find Haywire. Bellick finds Haywire, chasing him up a grain mill; Mahone climbs the mill and talks Haywire into committing suicide.\nMahone's next target, Benjamin Miles \"C-Note\" Franklin (Rockmond Dunbar), narrowly evades him; C-Note soon offers to turn himself in, however, if his wife and child are cared for. C-Note is taken to jail, and Mahone tells him to commit suicide in order to guarantee the protection of his family. C-Note attempts suicide, but is rescued by the guards. Sullins makes a deal with him, and promises to release him if he testifies against Mahone.\nBecause he is unable to capture Michael, Mahone orders Agent Lang (Barbara Eve Harris) to follow Michael's girlfriend Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies). Mahone's sanity begins to unravel from his determination to catch Michael and Lincoln, and from his benzodiazepine addiction. Michael and Lincoln travel to Panama, where Mahone lures them into a trap by impersonating fellow escapee Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco). He captures Lincoln and contacts Michael, ordering him to surrender Charles Westmoreland's (Muse Watson) five million dollars and his boat, the Christina Rose. Michael plants drugs on the Christina Rose, which he gives to Mahone. After an attempt to kill Kim, Mahone takes the boat and leaves; however, he is arrested on drug-possession charges. Mahone is taken to Sona along with Michael, Bellick and Fox River escapee Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell (Robert Knepper).\n\nSeason 3\nInside Sona, Mahone attempts to convince Michael to form a partnership. Michael refuses to work with him, angry because Mahone killed his father. As new prisoners, Michael and Mahone are brought before Lechero (Robert Wisdom) (a prisoner who rules Sona and its residents). When Mahone learns about the bounty placed on fellow inmate James Whistler (Chris Vance), he manages to find him and deliver him to Lechero.\nMahone begins to suffer from drug withdrawal and is informed by his state-appointed lawyer that his trial is almost a full year away. When Whistler realizes that Michael is not entirely on his side, he forms an alliance with Mahone. Mahone deduces that Michael is planning to break Whistler out of the prison, and Michael eventually agrees to let him join the escape. After he begins hallucinating about Haywire, Mahone accepts heroin from T-Bag to calm himself.\nAgent Lang visits Mahone and offers him a deal: eight years in a St. Louis prison in exchange for testifying against the government in the Lincoln Burrows conspiracy, or multiple homicide charges if he does not cooperate. Mahone eventually accepts the offer and confesses to Lang that he killed Shales, and that guilt made him turn to drugs. Because he is unable to maintain his composure while testifying, Mahone's testimony is dismissed, and Lang is forced to return Mahone to Sona.\nMahone (now rehabilitated) approaches Whistler and Michael and rejoins the escape. He is informed that their escape route (a tunnel leading to the edge of the prison) is almost complete, and that they will break out of Sona that night. Michael, Whistler, Mahone and fellow inmate McGrady (Carlo Alban) manage to escape; Lechero, T-Bag and Bellick are caught by the Sona guards.\nLincoln wants to shoot Mahone in revenge for killing his father, but Whistler escapes from Lincoln's custody and Lincoln is forced to chase him. Mahone takes advantage of the situation and flees, eventually making his way to a bar.\nMahone is approached by Whistler, who offers him a job in the Company with him and operative Gretchen Morgan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). Mahone warns Whistler that Gretchen is the \"weak link\", and that Michael will eventually hunt them down if Gretchen has indeed killed Sara.\n\nSeason 4\nMahone accepts Whistler's offer to work for the Company, although the group is secretly working with Homeland Security to destroy the Company, focusing their attention on a card (code-named \"Scylla\"), which contains information on all of the Company's agents and operations. Whistler finds the card; however, he is killed by the Company's hitman, Wyatt (Cress Williams), who takes the card.\nMahone returns to his family home to find his son has been murdered and since he is a wanted criminal, he is arrested by the police. Mahone is contacted by Agent Don Self (Michael Rapaport), a Homeland Security agent who was working with Whistler to take down the Company. He offers Mahone freedom if he joins an unofficial operation to recover Scylla from the Company. Mahone accepts, learning that other members of the operation are Michael, Lincoln, Sara, Bellick, Sucre and computer hacker and identity thief Roland Glenn (James Hiroyuki Liao). The group devises a plan to regain the card, which succeeds, however, they learn that Scylla is actually made up of six cards held by different members of The Company. The group continues to look for the other cards, while Mahone asks Lang to find out who killed his son.\nMahone obtains a picture of Wyatt and meets with his estranged wife Pam, who makes him promise to hunt down and kill Wyatt. When Wyatt is captured Mahone tortures him, forcing him to apologize to his wife over the phone. He ties a cinderblock to Wyatt's wrists, and drowns him in the ocean. The group manages to complete Scylla, and Lincoln absolves Mahone for his role in his father's death. Self betrays the team and steals Scylla, forcing them to be fugitives once again.\nWhile the others hunt Self, Mahone meets with Lang and asks for help. Lang calls Wheeler to help Mahone; however, Wheeler lies to Mahone about a meeting with the Attorney General and arrests him. While transporting Mahone to the airport, Lang allows him to escape and lies to Wheeler about the direction in which he has fled. Mahone returns to help Lincoln, Self, T-Bag and Gretchen retrieve Scylla. When Gretchen is shot while trying to double-cross the team, Mahone and the others leave her for the authorities.\nAfter realizing Lincoln's mother (Christina Scofield) took Scylla, Mahone helps him stop her and retrieve Scylla after the Company threatens him with a photo of Pam. He later saves Lincoln from being assassinated by one of Christina's snipers. Mahone identifies one of the people who have connections with Christina, Vincent Sandinsky. The team does not find any connections with him and he believes his story. They catch him in the lie; after Krantz arrives to take charge they interrogate Sandinsky, who reveals some information about a hotel room. He and the team track a car rental slip and after more digging, eventually find the car (with their passports) outside the energy conference; they realize it is a set-up. It is revealed that Christina is setting the team up for the assassination of the Indian Prime Minister's son (who was thought to have brought Scylla). After the assassination of Naveen Banarjee, Mahone and Self are outside the hotel on the phone with Scofield and Burrows. The brothers tell Mahone to go to the apartment where Sara is holding Christina hostage, and make Christina talk by any means necessary. Mahone goes to the apartment, finding only Sara tied up and gagged; he unties Sara and heads back to the loft, where the General and T-Bag are. Mahone, Michael and Lincoln then head to a bank, where they believe Christina is with Scylla. They enter the bank wearing masks, to avoid being recognized. They take Scylla, and when they get outside a shootout begins. Mahone and Michael get away, but Linc is caught.\nIn the next episode, Mahone and Michael are the only ones left on the team. Linc and Sara are captured, and Self is in the hospital. Mahone and Michael decide it is time to bring the Company down and save everyone; they decide to go after Lincoln first. They set up a trap for Christina, but the police arrive; one of Christina's guards is killed in an explosion set up by Michael and meant for Christina. Later Michael gives Scylla to Mahone without the hard drive and has him save Lincoln, while Michael goes after Sara. Mahone has a bomb in Scylla which is large enough to kill Christina and her man, Downey. Christina has Mahone put in the same room Lincoln is in, moving Lincoln to the other side of the room. When the bomb fails to detonate and Christina realizes there is something wrong with Scylla, she calls on Mahone to check the device and threatens to kill him if he cannot activate it. He sets it manually. After a struggle with Christina and Downey, Mahone runs to the room where Lincoln is; the bomb detonates, killing Downey, but Christina survives. Michael and Sara come to pick up Lincoln and Mahone and head to another location, where Scylla's hard drive is. The remaining team then heads to a hospital for supplies to treat Lincoln's gunshot wound. Sara and Mahone go into the hospital, and Mahone is arrested by Federal agents. He is later freed and exonerated when Michael delivers Scylla to Kellerman. In the series' epilogue (set four years later), Mahone has begun dating Lang, and he, Lincoln, Sucre, Michael's child and Sara visit Michael's grave at a beach.\n\nThe Final Break\nAfter the FBI finds out that Michael is going to try and break Sara out of prison they contact Mahone. Mahone is offered his old job back with the FBI if he agrees to give them credible information that leads to proof of Michael's plans. Mahone gives up the blind spot in the cameras that Michael had found, which the FBI fixes and then demands more information from Mahone. Mahone eventually decides not to turn his back on Michael but instead to use the connection to his advantage. Mahone informs the FBI that Michael is going to parachute into the prison, and when a dummy is parachuted into the prison Michael has enough of a distraction to break Sara out. Once Sara has escaped safely, Mahone gives her and Lincoln a tape from Michael that explained why he sacrificed himself for Sara.\n\nSeason 5\nIn July 2016 it was revealed that Fichtner would not be reprising his role as Mahone in the upcoming fifth season. Robert Knepper told Digital Spy that \"[writer] Paul Scheuring loves Bill Fichtner and I love Bill Fichtner. He's a brilliant actor – but Paul honestly said to me, 'I don't know what to do with that character'. He didn't want to just bring everybody back, so that the audience go, 'Oh, look, it's Bill Fichtner again!' – he honestly thought, 'I'm not sure where to do that in the plot.' So if someday there's another chapter of this, maybe then Bill will be back. But I think the characters that are there, each of our moments that we have, are key to the storytelling, which is how it should be.\"\nMahone's absence is somewhat explained in the final episode of the revival; in which Michael Scofield recounts to Theodore Bagwell how their mutual enemy Poseidon had been monitoring Michael's communications with anyone he believed could be a resource or ally. With those individuals, such as Mahone, unavailable; Michael is forced to turn to Bagwell himself for assistance.\n\nCharacteristics\nMahone is depicted as an intelligent FBI agent with \"an amazingly sharp mind\", quickly discovering the secret of Michael's tattoos and his plans. His thoroughness and investigational skills allow him to extrapolate the fugitives' location, causing Michael to remark, \"It's like he knows where we're going, what we're thinking.\" Mahone has been described as \"intellectually matched with Scofield\", mainly in his ability to analyze and interpret his surroundings. Craig Blanchard of The San Diego Union-Tribune describes Michael as the \"brains of the operation\" and Mahone as his \"arch-nemesis, sort of his equal on the other side of the law.\" Michael and Mahone have been described as \"two sides of the same brilliant coin\"; however, Mahone notes, \"there's one big difference between you and I (sic), Michael. And you just proved it. You can't kill. And that's what it's gonna take to stop me. Because I don't have the same reservations. I can.\" His willingness to commit murder in order to preserve his life is shown when Michael asks if he would kill two innocent men to \"get his life back\", to which he replies \"Absolutely.\" Fichtner defends Mahone by saying that he \"doesn't do everything he does because he wants to do it. He's not OK about it. It's going to start to come out.\"\nMahone is not a straightforward character, and his past is revealed as the series progresses. According to series creator Paul Scheuring, the writers try to let all the characters in the show \"inhabit a gray area.\" Scheuring says that although Mahone's pursuit in the second season is very noble, \"there are some things about him that we will learn that are slightly less than noble.\" Fichtner tries to play the character with a soft side, and believes that those characterizing him as \"a hard guy\" are \"missing what I'm trying to do.\" Regarding the frequent intake of pills by Mahone, the series' executive producer and writer Matt Olmstead says:\n\nMahone has certain things in his past, as far as what he's done in the service of his country, things he's done around the world—he's starting to hear footsteps from all of that. It doesn't throw him off his game at all but the sum total of his life does begin to present itself.\nMahone's anxiety is evident when he reaches for the varatril pills hidden inside his pen. When Mahone runs out of pills, he is tense and easily agitated. Fichtner notes the erratic behavior of his character, commenting, \"The more twisted the better! Who wants to play a straight-away FBI guy?\" He says that the actions that Mahone takes are affected by \"some of the things that Mahone has in the back of his closet—and in the back of his mind, the voices he is hearing about his own life.\" Andy Dehnart of MSNBC observes that Mahone, \"as played by William Fichtner, always seemed to be on the edge of a nervous breakdown.\"\nAlthough not a major characteristic, Mahone is depicted as remarkably good at unarmed combat (probably due to his military background). It is surprising when Lincoln attempts to kill him, he rapidly masters him and tries to choke him; Lincoln only manages to master him by squeezing his previous gunshot wound, only to be overcome again and have Mahone's gun on him. When one of Lechero's men attempts to stab Michael at the beginning of season three, Mahone stops him and breaks his neck in seconds. He is also the only one T-Bag believed could kill Sammy, but when the tunnel crumbles on top of Sammy Mahone rapidly masters his men. In season four when Christina Rose orders her bodyguard to kill Mahone, he beats both of them down within seconds.\n\nDevelopment\nThe character of Mahone was not in the original plan of the Prison Break staff writers for the second season. When the writers approached the Fox network with their plans for the second season, Fox Entertainment president Peter Liguori suggested including a fugitive pursuer who was \"not corrupt\"; a character who is \"like the Tommy Lee Jones character in The Fugitive.\" Along with Paul Kellerman and Brad Bellick, Mahone became a fugitive hunter at the start of the second season. The writers were aware of the increasing number of antagonists in the show, which led Olmstead to remark, \"If there are too many people pursuing them, [the pursuers] are rendered inept because they're not all catching our convicts, and you can only have so many close calls.\" The writers decided that the character of Mahone was to be a \"very formidable\" nemesis for the protagonists, and the \"flip side of Michael Scofield.\" Scheuring acknowledges comparisons made between Mahone and Les Misérables' character, Inspector Javert, \"He certainly is Javert to Michael's Valjean, but you can express it however you want. He's his nemesis.\" One of the tricks used by the Prison Break writers is to constantly shift the sympathetic characters. Olmstead notes, \"A white-hat character can be kind of boring.\" Fichtner does not believe that Mahone is a \"bad guy\"; rather, he has \"a lot of demons driving him.\"\n\nFichtner was cast as Alexander Mahone one day before filming began for the second season. After acting the previous year in the series Invasion, Fichtner did not intend to return to network television. When approached with the scripts for the first two episodes of the second season Fichtner was uncertain of his character's background, but attracted to \"the potential of who this guy is.\" Fichtner was given two days to decide whether he wanted to play the character and, although he was unsure if the experience would be worthwhile, he later said that he was glad to have accepted the role. Fichtner has praised the quality of writing on the series, saying \"Television shows live or die on writing. The joy of Prison Break has been the writers. They're great and they forever challenged me, which makes the journey worth it.\" Fichtner has also had several concerns with the scripts written for him, and talks to the writers to make sure that the character stays consistent. On at least one occasion, he has sat down with the writer and tweaked the entire script.\nFichtner said that his role on Prison Break ended up being \"a lot longer\" than he had originally thought. He was signed on to appear for a further two seasons, after being convinced by Olmstead to appear in a fourth (and final) one. The series' move from Dallas to Los Angeles for filming was also an inducement for Fichtner, who previously had to leave his family for filming. When Olmstead asked Fichtner to return for the fourth season, his only request was to make it challenging by making his character's journey difficult. Fichtner believes that in Mahone's journey, \"All of a sudden the blinders went up... And little by little, he's trying to make his way back.\" He thinks that his character's journey should end with \"something really out of the blue\": \"What if he totally loses it?\"\n\nReception\nMahone is often referred to by critics as Michael's nemesis. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found Mahone to be \"a far more worthy adversary for Michael than prison guard Brad Bellick... who's still after the convicts but seems like a cartoon compared to the Inspector Javert-like Mahone.\" Jeff Comings of the Arizona Daily Star comments that \"William Fichtner is going to be the best actor on any show this season. He's brooding, sexy, enigmatic and a little scary as the FBI man waiting for the clan to cross state lines and make this a federal case. Add in the reliance on those pills he's hiding in that pen and I think I smell Emmy!\" Brian Zoromski of IGN believes that the \"strongest portions of 'Manhunt' deal with the introduction of a new character, an FBI agent named Alexander Mahone, played by the great character actor William Fichtner.\"\nDigital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones praised the \"wonderful\" Fichtner, claiming he \"quickly became more appealing than the brooding hero himself,\" however, he did not enjoy Mahone's storyline in the third season. Rawson-Jones felt that Mahone had turned into a \"gibbering, sweating wreck most of the time\", with only \"occasional glimpses\" of his brilliance. Robert Bianco of USA Today said that although Fichtner was a welcome addition to the cast, he could not compensate for the \"harebrained absurdities that have swamped this show.\" Dehnart called Mahone the best new character of the second season, but remarked that his ability to move from various locations in a short amount of time made him seem to possess \"the power of super fast transportation.\"\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Sara Elizabeth Hill (born 1977) is a Cherokee and American attorney who has served as a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma since 2024. She previously served as the attorney general of the Cherokee Nation from August 2019 to August 2023 and as the tribe's secretary of natural resources between October 2015 and August 2019.\n\nEarly life and education\nSara Elizabeth Hill was born in 1977 in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and raised in Stigler, Oklahoma. Hill's high school debate coach, Ed Cannaday, would go on to serve in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. She graduated from Northeastern State University with a Bachelor of Arts, cum laude in 2000 and with a Juris Doctor from the University of Tulsa College of Law in 2003.\n\nCareer\nFrom 2004 to 2015, Hill served as a deputy attorney general for the Cherokee Nation. In December 2014, she was sworn in as a tribal special assistant U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Oklahoma's U.S. attorney's office, a position she held concurrently as deputy attorney general. On October 12, 2015, Hill was appointed the Cherokee Nation's first secretary of natural resources by principal chief Bill John Baker and she served in that position until August 29, 2019. She was succeeded by Chad Harsha.\n\nCherokee Nation attorney general\nOn August 29, 2019, Hill was appointed as the attorney general of the Cherokee Nation by newly elected principal chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. During her tenure as attorney general the United States Supreme Court issued the landmark McGirt v. Oklahoma (2020) decision which held the Muscogee Nation reservation was never disestablished. On March 11, 2021, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals ruled in Hogner v. Oklahoma that the Cherokee Nation reservation had also never been disestablished. Hill led the Cherokee Nation's effort to build up its criminal justice system after the Hogner ruling and the Nation's defense of the Indian Child Welfare Act during the Haaland v. Brackeen (2023) litigation. In the year following the ruling, the Cherokee Nation attorney general's office went from prosecuting around 300 criminal cases to over 3,000 criminal cases. Also during her tenure, the Cherokee Nation attorney general's office successfully sought the official striking of \"by blood\" language from Cherokee law by the Cherokee Nation Supreme Court. Hill criticized the 2022 Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta ruling saying \"It really didn't honor the foundations of federal Indian law. It overlooked and ignored the history of the tribes.\" In August 2023, she resigned to enter private practice.\n\nFederal judicial service\nOn October 18, 2023, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate Hill to fill a vacancy on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma. Her nomination was endorsed by Senators James Lankford and Markwayne Mullin as well as Cherokee Nation principal chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. The National Congress of American Indians, Native American Rights Fund, and Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes also supported her nomination. The nomination was criticized by Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, who is also a member of the Cherokee Nation. On October 24, 2023, her nomination was sent to the Senate. President Biden nominated Hill to the seat vacated by Judge Claire Eagan, who assumed senior status on October 1, 2022. On November 15, 2023, a hearing on her nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. During her hearing, Senators Mike Lee and Thom Tillis questioned her about tribal sovereignty and her criticism of the Castro-Huerta decision; asking whether she would recuse herself on issues of tribal sovereignty. On December 7, 2023, her nomination was reported out of committee by a 14–7 vote. On December 19, 2023, the United States Senate invoked cloture on her nomination by a 52–14 vote, with Senator Joe Manchin voting against the motion to invoke cloture. Later that day, her nomination was confirmed by a 52–14 vote, with Senator Manchin voting against confirmation. She received her judicial commission on January 2, 2024. She was sworn in on January 6, 2024. She became the first female Native American federal judge in Oklahoma history.\n\nSee also\nList of Native American jurists\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nSara E.

        "content": "On October 3, 2023, the United States House of Representatives voted to remove its speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California, through a motion to vacate filed by Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, a fellow member of the Republican Party. McCarthy's removal marked the first time in American history that a speaker of the House was removed through a motion to vacate. The vacancy started a process to elect a speaker that began following an eight-day recess.\nIn the 118th Congress, the 2022 elections formed a narrow majority for Republicans in the House of Representatives. The Freedom Caucus, the most conservative congressional caucus of Republican representatives, secured a minority of these seats. During the speakership election for the 118th Congress, McCarthy faced significant opposition within the Republican Conference from the Freedom Caucus, who saw him as untrustworthy and insufficiently conservative. After fifteen rounds of voting, McCarthy was elected speaker, conceding to his opponents by allowing any representative to file a motion to vacate. The potential of a government shutdown began to take hold in July 2023, with the Freedom Caucus—in demonstrations of austerity and defiance toward McCarthy—opposing spending bills to fund the government.\nBy September, the federal government appeared poised to shut down. The Freedom Caucus furthered its warnings to McCarthy: they warned him against brokered a deal with Democrats to pass temporary appropriations legislation, asking him to pass an all-year budget with deep spending cuts instead. McCarthy nevertheless led the House of Representatives in passing a continuing resolution on September 30; its passage was reliant on bipartisan support, but more Democrats than Republicans voted in favor. On October 2, Gaetz, a member of the Freedom Caucus, filed a motion to vacate. \nFollowing an unsuccessful motion to table by Representative Tom Cole, Republican Chair of the Rules Committee, Republican representatives debated McCarthy's speakership on the House floor. When the time for debate expired, the House voted to remove McCarthy, with insurgent Republicans and all Democrats present voting against him. The speaker's chair was vacated and Patrick McHenry of North Carolina—a McCarthy ally—was made speaker pro tempore and the House went without a proper speaker until the October 25 election of Mike Johnson of Louisiana. McCarthy subsequently announced his resignation from Congress effective at the end of 2023.\n\nProcess and replacement\nRemoving the speaker of the House necessitates the use of a motion to vacate. As part of negotiations for McCarthy's speakership, any single representative can initiate a motion to vacate. The motion takes the form of a simple resolution. The provision had only been used twice in the House of Representatives. In 1910, an unsuccessful motion was filed against Joseph G. Cannon. In 2015, Representative Mark Meadows proposed a motion to vacate against then-speaker John Boehner, but a vote was not officially called before Boehner resigned. A representative must file the resolution and request a vote; as a privileged resolution, the vote must occur within two legislative days. A vote may be blocked if the resolution is tabled or sent to committee. If passed, an internal list penned by McCarthy would appoint a speaker pro tempore until a new speaker was named. An election would then begin. \nA series of four candidates were nominated by the Republicans over several weeks:\n\nMajority leader Steve Scalise had been proposed as a potential speaker and won the Republican nomination on October 11, but he withdrew the next day.\nJim Jordan was the Republican nominee but was dropped by the House GOP conference after failing to win a vote on the House floor three times.\nTom Emmer was nominated next, but withdrew shortly after determining there was no way to convert 25 holdouts. Several members of the Freedom Caucus—including Representative Andy Biggs—reportedly had intended to coalesce around Emmer for his conservative values; Emmer had said he had \"zero interest in palace intrigue\". By the day of his nomination, however, over half the holdouts were from the Caucus.\nMike Johnson won.\n\nBackground\nMcCarthy's speakership\nThe 2022 midterm elections resulted in a narrow, 2-seat Senate majority for the Democratic Party and a narrow, 4-seat House of Representatives majority for the Republican Party. In the 118th Congress, the Freedom Caucus, a far-right congressional caucus, secured 45 House of Representatives seats. McCarthy, leader of the House Republican Conference, was elected speaker of the House after several days of voting as opposition—primarily led by members of the Freedom Caucus—mounted against him. McCarthy conceded to his opponents to negotiate their support for his speakership. In May 2023, McCarthy negotiated with President Joe Biden on a deal to resolve a debt-ceiling crisis and an imminent debt default. In response, Republicans, led by Gaetz, balked and blocked consideration of a bill protecting gas stoves against federal regulations. The mutiny left McCarthy with a political quagmire to either acquiesce to the insurgents, passing legislation that would face resistance in the Democratic-controlled Senate, or to negotiate with House Democrats, contending with a potential ousting.\n\nPassage of a continuing resolution on the federal budget\nBy September, the federal government appeared poised to shut down after representatives could not vote on a series of appropriations bills. The Freedom Caucus threatened to depose McCarthy if he passed legislation which did not include the budget reforms they wanted, relying on Democrats to pass a bipartisan funding resolution instead. On September 29, Politico reported that Gaetz had reached out to Congressional Progressive Caucus chair Pramila Jayapal, among other Democrats, about removing McCarthy. The following day, hours before a shutdown was expected to occur, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5860, a continuing resolution to fund the government through November 17, which extended current funding to Federal Departments without enacting any meaningful reform; the resolution was passed in the Senate and signed by President Biden, averting a shutdown. McCarthy had relied on Democratic votes to pass the continuing resolution due to opposition from some House Republicans. The resolution passed the House 335–91, with all but one of the votes cast against it coming from Republicans. Gaetz, who had led intra-party opposition to McCarthy, announced in an interview with CNN that he would move to remove McCarthy: he criticized McCarthy for working with Democrats to pass a temporary spending bill without spending cuts, and for introducing the bill itself at the very last moment (leaving representatives with barely enough time to read it before voting on it).\n\nMotion to vacate\nResolved, That the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives is hereby declared to be vacant.\nOn October 2, Gaetz filed a motion to vacate, forcing a vote on McCarthy's removal within two legislative days. Politico's Ryan Lizza speculated that if McCarthy had retained his position, Gaetz might have simply proposed additional motions to vacate, as there is no limit on the number of times a member can do so.\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus consensus\nMany Democrats would cite an inability for them to trust McCarthy as motivating House Democrats to vote as a unified bloc in support of the motion to vacate. There was also little on McCarthy's agenda that appealed to Democrats on a legislative level. Despite relying on Democratic votes to pass the continuing resolution, after its passage, McCarthy had attacked Democrats in an interview aired on Face the Nation, baselessly accusing them of having attempted to obstruct its passage. These comments, amongst others, were seen as one of several instances in which he had established ill will and distrust among House Democrats during his speakership. Ahead of the removal vote, McCarthy publicly ruled out the possibility of a deal to receive votes for his retention from Democrats in exchange for concessions.\nOn October 3, prior to the vote, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries asked Democrats to vote to remove McCarthy. The conclusion was that the pending motion to vacate highlighted the dysfunction in the Republican Party, which Democrats argued made Republicans unsuitable to govern. Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut said, \"They [Republicans] need to work this out.... This is not for us to get involved.\"\n\nVoting and debate\nThe motion to vacate was considered by the House on October 3. Tom Cole, chairman of the Republican-led House Rules Committee, unsuccessfully attempted to remove the matter from consideration by introducing a motion to table, which was however rejected by a vote of 218—208. Following one hour of debate evenly divided between Gaetz and Cole, the motion passed by a vote of 216–210; this was the first time in congressional history the House voted to remove its incumbent speaker.\n\nResults\nVote to table\nThe vote to table the motion was primarily split along party lines; all Democrats present voted against tabling the motion and a majority of Republicans voted to table the motion. Republicans Biggs, Ken Buck, Tim Burchett, Eli Crane, Warren Davidson, Gaetz, Bob Good, Nancy Mace, Cory Mills, Matt Rosendale, and Victoria Spartz voted no.\n\nVote to vacate\nThe vote to vacate was mostly split along party lines; all Democrats present voted yes and a majority of Republicans voted no. Republican representatives Biggs, Buck, Burchett, Crane, Gaetz, Good, Mace and Rosendale voted yes. \nIn the January speaker election, Biggs, Crane, Gaetz, Good and Rosendale had been five of six Republicans who had never voted for McCarthy (though they had all voted \"present\" on the last ballot, allowing McCarthy to be elected), while Buck, Burchett and Mace had voted for McCarthy on every ballot they had taken part in. \nBurchett said his yes vote was \"sealed\" after McCarthy allegedly made a \"condescending\" remark about his religious beliefs during a phone call. McCarthy said that he did not intend to upset Burchett. Mace, who is a member of moderate caucuses such as the Republican Governance Group and Problem Solvers Caucus, defended her vote by citing unfulfilled promises McCarthy made regarding the future strategy of the Republican Conference towards gun violence and abortion. Buck cited similar broken promises regarding the budget. Jeffries and congressional Democrats said their yes votes were ultimately sealed by a video of \"an appearance Mr. McCarthy made on television on Sunday—the morning after Democrats helped him push through legislation to avert a government shutdown — in which he blamed them for trying to prompt a shutdown.\"\n\nVotes cast by members\nAll House members of the 118th Congress that voted against party lines or were absent for one or both votes, are noted here.\n\nAftermath\nNorth Carolina Representative McHenry, a described close ally of McCarthy, was appointed as his temporary replacement as speaker pro tempore of the House. The House's legislative activities were temporarily halted as speaker pro tempore McHenry began an eight-day recess. \nFollowing his removal, McCarthy announced that he would not seek reelection as Speaker, leaving an open race to fill the office. This left the House Republicans in a state of uncertainty, as there is no apparent successor to lead the House Republican majority. The Republican Conference reconvened on October 10 to nominate their first candidate for Speaker, House majority leader Steve Scalise, who would withdraw before a floor vote. Gaetz said he does not intend to run for speakership. Jim Jordan held three unsuccessful floor votes, followed by a short nomination of Tom Emmer, after which the final successful candidate Mike Johnson succeeded on October 25.\nFormer speaker and representative from California Nancy Pelosi was asked to move from her secondary office space in the Capitol by McHenry, who assumed full authority over office space assignments as speaker pro tempore. Maryland Representative Steny Hoyer, former house majority leader, also received a notice from Republican leadership to move out of his Capitol office space. Several outlets reported that McCarthy was behind the move, over Democrats' refusal to support him during the vote. McCarthy continued to use the speaker's office during the vacancy of the speakership position.\nLess than a week after McCarthy's ouster, Israel — one of the United States' closest allies — was attacked by the militant group Hamas, which began the 2023 Israel-Hamas War. McCarthy's ouster and the subsequent leadership debacle have been cited as the main reasons behind a failure for an aid package to be passed in support of Israel. Some McCarthy supporters attempted to use the crisis to reinstall McCarthy as speaker, but these efforts failed.\nOn November 14, Speaker Mike Johnson ushered the passage of a stop-gap spending bill to avert a government shutdown in a 336–96 vote. Similarly to McCarthy before his ouster, Johnson relied upon the votes of Democrats to accomplish this (with 209 Democrats and 127 Republicans voting for the bill, while 94 Republicans and two Democrats voted against it). No immediate effort rose to oust Johnson over this action, including when he did so again in January 2024. However, after two minibus spending bills passed in March 2024, Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she would file a motion to oust Johnson.\nOn May 8, 2024, Greene made the motion to vacate against Mike Johnson privileged, forcing it onto the floor. The motion was immediately met with a successful vote to table by Steve Scalise supported by a bipartisan legislative coalition.\n\nResponses\nMcCarthy\nMcCarthy declared, \"I fought for what I believe in. I believe I can continue to fight, but maybe in a different manner.\" In a press conference following his removal, McCarthy blamed Democrats. He argued that Democrats should have voted against the motion to vacate to protect the institution. McCarthy also said that Pelosi had promised him that Democrats would support McCarthy during a motion to vacate. He later left Congress at the end of 2023, but continued to influence the political sphere with his renowned fundraising network; specifically, recruiting and funding challengers to the eight Representatives who ousted him.\n\nRepublican Party\nFormer vice president Mike Pence said, \"Chaos is never America's strength, and it's never a friend of American families that are struggling.\" Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said that Gaetz was \"actively destructive to the conservative movement.\" Gingrich also said that House Republicans should expel Gaetz. Some Republicans blamed Democrats for not supporting McCarthy. Republican members of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus threatened to quit the caucus after Democrats voted. The National Republican Congressional Committee called Democrats the \"Chaos Caucus,\" a term originally coined to describe far-right Republicans.\nAdolfo Franco, a lawyer and Republican Party strategist, speaking from Florida, told Al Jazeera that it was a \"five-seat majority in a divided government\" that removed McCarthy. \"The reality is we have a democratic President, and a democratic Senate [sic]. We don’t have absolute majorities. Mr. Gaetz is living in a fantasy world. So I feel terrible for a man who has accomplished so much for our country to be ousted,\" Franco said.\n\nForty-five Republican representatives wrote an open letter objecting to the McCarthy ejection from his position as speaker. The letter said the representatives were \"ashamed and embarrassed by what happened\", and praised McCarthy's performance as \"one of the most accomplished Republican leaders in modern history\".\n\nDemocratic Party\nOn October 4, Jeffries released a statement wishing McCarthy well and saying that he and McCarthy \"had a respectful, communicative, and forward-looking relationship.\"\n\nAnalysis\nThe Washington Post political contributor Dan Balz speculated that the ousting of McCarthy could hurt Republicans during the 2024 elections.\nPolitical observers have noted a historical parallel between the turmoil engulfing the House Republican Conference surrounding McCarthy's removal and the events following the resignation of Newt Gingrich precipitated by an internal caucus rebellion in the wake of the 1998 elections. The lead-up to the 106th United States Congress was marked by significant events, including the 1998 bombing of Iraq and the impeachment of Bill Clinton; during this turbulent period, Bob Livingston was briefly the presumptive speaker before he, too, resigned, with then-little-known Dennis Hastert ultimately becoming speaker on January 6, 1999.\n\nSee also\nOctober 2015 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election\nYaroslav Hunka scandal, which caused Canadian Speaker of the House Anthony Rota to resign within the same week\n\nNotes\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "A rogue planet, also termed a free-floating planet (FFP) or an isolated planetary-mass object (iPMO), is an interstellar object of planetary mass which is not gravitationally bound to any star or brown dwarf.\nRogue planets may originate from planetary systems in which they are formed and later ejected, or they can also form on their own, outside a planetary system. The Milky Way alone may have billions to trillions of rogue planets, a range the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will likely be able to narrow.\nSome planetary-mass objects may have formed in a similar way to stars, and the International Astronomical Union has proposed that such objects be called sub-brown dwarfs. A possible example is Cha 110913−773444, which may either have been ejected and become a rogue planet or formed on its own to become a sub-brown dwarf.\n\nTerminology\nThe two first discovery papers use the names isolated planetary-mass objects (iPMO) and free-floating planets (FFP). Most astronomical papers use one of these terms. The term rogue planet is more often used for microlensing studies, which also often uses the term FFP. A press release intended for the public might use an alternative name. The discovery of at least 70 FFPs in 2021, for example, used the terms rogue planet, starless planet, wandering planet and free-floating planet in different press releases.\n\nDiscovery\nIsolated planetary-mass objects (iPMO) were first discovered in 2000 by the UK team Lucas & Roche with UKIRT in the Orion Nebula. In the same year the Spanish team Zapatero Osorio et al. discovered iPMOs with Keck spectroscopy in the σ Orionis cluster. The spectroscopy of the objects in the Orion Nebula was published in 2001. Both European teams are now recognized for their quasi-simultaneous discoveries. In 1999 the Japanese team Oasa et al. discovered objects in Chamaeleon I that were spectroscopically confirmed years later in 2004 by the US team Luhman et al.\n\nObservation\nThere are two techniques to discover free-floating planets: direct imaging and microlensing.\n\nMicrolensing\nAstrophysicist Takahiro Sumi of Osaka University in Japan and colleagues, who form the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics and the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment collaborations, published their study of microlensing in 2011. They observed 50 million stars in the Milky Way by using the 1.8-metre (5 ft 11 in) MOA-II telescope at New Zealand's Mount John Observatory and the 1.3-metre (4 ft 3 in) University of Warsaw telescope at Chile's Las Campanas Observatory. They found 474 incidents of microlensing, ten of which were brief enough to be planets of around Jupiter's size with no associated star in the immediate vicinity. The researchers estimated from their observations that there are nearly two Jupiter-mass rogue planets for every star in the Milky Way. One study suggested a much larger number, up to 100,000 times more rogue planets than stars in the Milky Way, though this study encompassed hypothetical objects much smaller than Jupiter. A 2017 study by Przemek Mróz of Warsaw University Observatory and colleagues, with six times larger statistics than the 2011 study, indicates an upper limit on Jupiter-mass free-floating or wide-orbit planets of 0.25 planets per main-sequence star in the Milky Way.\nIn September 2020, astronomers using microlensing techniques reported the detection, for the first time, of an Earth-mass rogue planet (named OGLE-2016-BLG-1928) unbound to any star and free floating in the Milky Way galaxy.\nIn December 2013, a candidate exomoon of a possible rogue planet (MOA-2011-BLG-262) was announced.\n\nDirect imaging\nMicrolensing planets can only be studied by the microlensing event, which makes the characterization of the planet difficult. Astronomers therefore turn to isolated planetary-mass objects (iPMO) that were found via the direct imaging method. To determine a mass of a brown dwarf or iPMO one needs for example the luminosity and the age of an object. Determining the age of a low-mass object has proven to be difficult. It is no surprise that the vast majority of iPMOs are found inside young nearby star-forming regions of which astronomers know their age. These objects are younger than 200 Myrs, are massive (>5 MJ) and belong to the L- and T-dwarfs. There is however a small growing sample of cold and old Y-dwarfs that have estimated masses of 8-20 MJ. Nearby rogue planet candidates of spectral type Y include WISE 0855−0714 at a distance of 7.27±0.13 light-years. If this sample of Y-dwarfs can be characterized with more accurate measurements or if a way to better characterize their ages can be found, the number of old and cold iPMOs will likely increase significantly.\nThe first iPMOs were discovered in the early 2000s via direct imaging inside young star-forming regions. These iPMOs found via direct imaging formed probably like stars (sometimes called sub-brown dwarf). There might be iPMOs that form like a planet, which are then ejected. These objects will however be kinematically different from their natal star-forming region, should not be surrounded by a circumstellar disk and have high metallicity. None of the iPMOs found inside young star-forming regions show a high velocity compared to their star-forming region. For old iPMOs the cold WISE J0830+2837 shows a Vtan of about 100 km/s, which is high, but still consistent with formation in our galaxy. For WISE 1534–1043 one alternative scenario explains this object as an ejected exoplanet due to its high Vtan of about 200 km/s, but its color suggests it is an old metal-poor brown dwarf. Most astronomers studying massive iPMOs believe that they represent the low-mass end of the star-formation process.\nAstronomers have used the Herschel Space Observatory and the Very Large Telescope to observe a very young free-floating planetary-mass object, OTS 44, and demonstrate that the processes characterizing the canonical star-like mode of formation apply to isolated objects down to a few Jupiter masses. Herschel far-infrared observations have shown that OTS 44 is surrounded by a disk of at least 10 Earth masses and thus could eventually form a mini planetary system. Spectroscopic observations of OTS 44 with the SINFONI spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope have revealed that the disk is actively accreting matter, similar to the disks of young stars.\n\nBinaries\nThe first discovery of a resolved planetary-mass binary was 2MASS J1119–1137AB. There are however other binaries known, such as 2MASS J1553022+153236AB, WISE 1828+2650, WISE 0146+4234, WISE J0336−0143 (could also be a brown dwarf and a planetary-mass object (BD+PMO) binary), NIRISS-NGC1333-12 and several objects discovered by Zhang et al.\nIn the Orion Nebula a population of 40 wide binaries and 2 triple systems were discovered. This was surprising for two reasons: The trend of binaries of brown dwarfs predicted a decrease of distance between low mass objects with decreasing mass. It was also predicted that the binary fraction decreases with mass. These binaries were named Jupiter-mass binary objects (JuMBOs). They make up at least 9% of the iPMOs and have a separation smaller than 340 AU. It is unclear how these JuMBOs formed, but an extensive study argued that they formed in situ, like stars. If they formed like stars, then there must be an unknown \"extra ingredient\" to allow them to form. If they formed like planets and were later ejected, then it has to be explained why these binaries did not break apart during the ejection process. Future measurements with JWST might resolve if these objects formed as ejected planets or as stars. A study by Kevin Luhman reanalysed the NIRCam data and found that most JuMBOs did not appear in his sample of substellar objects. Moreover the color were consistent with reddened background sources or low signal-to-noise sources. Only JuMBO 29 is identified as a good candidate in this work. JuMBO 29 also was observed with NIRSpec and one component was identified as a young M8 source. This spectral type is consistent with a low mass for the age of the Orion Nebula.\n\nTotal number of known iPMOs\nThere are likely hundreds of known candidate iPMOs, over a hundred objects with spectra and a small but growing number of candidates discovered via microlensing. Some large surveys include:\nAs of December 2021, the largest-ever group of rogue planets was discovered, numbering at least 70 and up to 170 depending on the assumed age. They are found in the OB association between Upper Scorpius and Ophiuchus with masses between 4 and 13 MJ and age around 3 to 10 million years, and were most likely formed by either gravitational collapse of gas clouds, or formation in a protoplanetary disk followed by ejection due to dynamical instabilities. Follow-up observations with spectroscopy from the Subaru Telescope and Gran Telescopio Canarias showed that the contamination of this sample is quite low (≤6%). The 16 young objects had a mass between 3 and 14 MJ, confirming that they are indeed planetary-mass objects.\nIn October 2023 an even larger group of 540 planetary-mass object candidates was discovered in the Trapezium Cluster and inner Orion Nebula with JWST. The objects have a mass between 13 and 0.6 MJ. A surprising number of these objects formed wide binaries, which was not predicted.\n\nFormation\nThere are in general two scenarios that can lead to the formation of an isolated planetary-mass object (iPMO). It can form like a planet around a star and is then ejected, or it forms like a low-mass star or brown dwarf in isolation. This can influence its composition and motion.\n\nFormation like a star\nObjects with a mass of at least one Jupiter mass were thought to be able to form via collapse and fragmentation of molecular clouds from models in 2001. Pre-JWST observations have shown that objects below 3-5 MJ are unlikely to form on their own. Observations in 2023 in the Trapezium Cluster with JWST have shown that objects as massive as 0.6 MJ might form on their own, not requiring a steep cut-off mass. A particular type of globule, called globulettes, are thought to be birthplaces for brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects. Globulettes are found in the Rosette Nebula and IC 1805. Sometimes young iPMOs are still surrounded by a disk that could form exomoons. Due to the tight orbit of this type of exomoon around their host planet, they have a high chance of 10-15% to be transiting.\n\nDisks\nSome very young star-forming regions, typically younger than 5 million years, sometimes contain isolated planetary-mass objects with infrared excess and signs of accretion. Most well known is the iPMO OTS 44 discovered to have a disk and being located in Chamaeleon I. Charmaeleon I and II have other candidate iPMOs with disks. Other star-forming regions with iPMOs with disks or accretion are Lupus I, Rho Ophiuchi Cloud Complex, Sigma Orionis cluster, Orion Nebula, Taurus, NGC 1333 and IC 348. A large survey of disks around brown dwarfs and iPMOs with ALMA found that these disks are not massive enough to form earth-mass planets. There is still the possibility that the disks already have formed planets. Studies of red dwarfs have shown that some have gas-rich disks at a relative old age. These disks were dubbed Peter Pan Disks and this trend could continue into the planetary-mass regime. One Peter Pan disk is the 45 Myr old brown dwarf 2MASS J02265658-5327032 with a mass of about 13.7 MJ, which is close to the planetary-mass regime.\n\nFormation like a planet\nEjected planets are predicted to be mostly low-mass (<30 ME Figure 1 Ma et al.) and their mean mass depends on the mass of their host star. Simulations by Ma et al. did show that 17.5% of 1 M☉ stars eject a total of 16.8 ME per star with a typical (median) mass of 0.8 ME for an individual free-floating planet (FFP). For lower mass red dwarfs with a mass of 0.3 M☉ 12% of stars eject a total of 5.1 ME per star with a typical mass of 0.3 ME for an individual FFP.\nHong et al. predicted that exomoons can be scattered by planet-planet interactions and become ejected exomoons. Higher mass (0.3-1 MJ) ejected FFP are predicted to be possible, but they are also predicted to be rare. Ejection of a planet can occur via planet-planet scatter or due a stellar flyby. Another possibility is the ejection of a fragment of a disk that then forms into a planetary-mass object. Another suggested scenario is the ejection of planets in a tilted circumbinary orbit. Interactions with the central binary and the planets with each other can lead to the ejection of the lower-mass planet in the system.\n\nOther scenarios\nIf a stellar or brown dwarf embryo experiences a halted accretion, it could remain low-mass enough to become a planetary-mass object. Such a halted accretion could occur if the embryo is ejected or if its circumstellar disk experiences photoevaporation near O-stars. Objects that formed via the ejected embryo scenario would have smaller or no disk and the fraction of binaries decreases for such objects. It could also be that free-floating planetary-mass objects for from a combination of scenarios.\n\nFate\nMost isolated planetary-mass objects will float in interstellar space forever.\nSome iPMOs will have a close encounter with a planetary system. This rare encounter can have three outcomes: The iPMO will remain unbound, it could be weakly bound to the star, or it could \"kick out\" the exoplanet, replacing it. Simulations have shown that the vast majority of these encounters result in a capture event with the iPMO being weakly bound with a low gravitational binding energy and an elongated highly eccentric orbit. These orbits are not stable and 90% of these objects gain energy due to planet-planet encounters and are ejected back into interstellar space. Only 1% of all stars will experience this temporary capture.\n\nWarmth\nInterstellar planets generate little heat and are not heated by a star. However, in 1998, David J. Stevenson theorized that some planet-sized objects adrift in interstellar space might sustain a thick atmosphere that would not freeze out. He proposed that these atmospheres would be preserved by the pressure-induced far-infrared radiation opacity of a thick hydrogen-containing atmosphere.\nDuring planetary-system formation, several small protoplanetary bodies may be ejected from the system. An ejected body would receive less of the stellar-generated ultraviolet light that can strip away the lighter elements of its atmosphere. Even an Earth-sized body would have enough gravity to prevent the escape of the hydrogen and helium in its atmosphere. In an Earth-sized object the geothermal energy from residual core radioisotope decay could maintain a surface temperature above the melting point of water, allowing liquid-water oceans to exist. These planets are likely to remain geologically active for long periods. If they have geodynamo-created protective magnetospheres and sea floor volcanism, hydrothermal vents could provide energy for life. These bodies would be difficult to detect because of their weak thermal microwave radiation emissions, although reflected solar radiation and far-infrared thermal emissions may be detectable from an object that is less than 1,000 astronomical units from Earth. Around five percent of Earth-sized ejected planets with Moon-sized natural satellites would retain their satellites after ejection.  A large satellite would be a source of significant geological tidal heating.\n\nList\nThe table below lists rogue planets, confirmed or suspected, that have been discovered. It is yet unknown whether these planets were ejected from orbiting a star or else formed on their own as sub-brown dwarfs. Whether exceptionally low-mass rogue planets (such as OGLE-2012-BLG-1323 and KMT-2019-BLG-2073) are even capable of being formed on their own is currently unknown.\n\nDiscovered via direct imaging\nThese objects were discovered with the direct imaging method. Many were discovered in young star-clusters or stellar associations and a few old are known (such as WISE 0855−0714). List is sorted after discovery year.\n\nDiscovered via microlensing\nThese objects were discovered via microlensing. Rogue planets discovered via microlensing can only be studied by the lensing event and are often also consistent with exoplanets in a wide orbit around an unseen star.\n\nDiscovered via transit\nSee also\nIntergalactic star – Star not gravitationally bound to any galaxy\nInterstellar object – an astronomical object in interstellar space that is not gravitationally bound to a star\nʻOumuamua – an interstellar object that passed through the Solar System in 2017\nRogue black hole – a gravitationally unbound black hole\nRogue extragalactic planets – rogue planets outside the Milky Way galaxy\nTidally detached exomoon – rogue planets that were originally moons\n\nIn fiction\nA Pail of Air (1951) — a science fiction short story Fritz Leiber\nRemina (2004–2005) – horror manga by Junji Ito\nMelancholia (2011) – science fiction film by Lars von Trier\nDark Eden (2012) – a social science fiction novel by Chris Beckett\nThe Wandering Earth (2019) – a science fiction film directed by Frant Gwo\nGemini Home Entertainment (2019–present) – horror anthology web series by Remy Abode\nCarol & the End of the World (2023) – an animated adult comedy miniseries by Dan Guterman\n\nReferences\nBibliography\n\"Possibility of Life Sustaining Planets in Interstellar Space\" Article by Stevenson similar to the Nature article but with more information.\n\nExternal links\n\nDefinition of a \"Planet\" (Resolution B5 – IAU)\nStrange New Worlds Could Make Miniature Solar Systems Robert Roy Britt (SPACE.com) 5 June 2006 11:35 am ET\nThe IAU draft definition of \"planet\" and \"plutons\" press release (International Astronomical Union) 2006"

        "content": "Kirtanananda Swami (IAST: Kīrtanānanda Svāmī; September 6, 1937 – October 24, 2011), also known as Swami Bhaktipada, was a Gaudiya Vaishnava guru, the co-founder of New Vrindaban, a Hare Krishna community in Marshall County, West Virginia, where he served as spiritual leader from 1968 until 1994, and a convicted criminal.\nThe first sannyasi in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), he also served as an initiating guru in ISKCON from 1977 until his expulsion in 1987.\n\nEarly life\nKīrtanānanda was born Keith Gordon Ham in Peekskill, New York, in 1937, the youngest of five children of Conservative Baptist minister Francis Gordon Ham and his wife Marjorie. Keith's older brother, F. Gerald Ham, would go on to fame as an archivist. Keith Ham inherited his father's missionary spirit and attempted to convert classmates to his family's faith. Despite an acute case of polio which he contracted around his 17th birthday, he graduated with honors from high school in 1955. He received a Bachelor of Arts in History from Maryville College in Maryville, Tennessee on May 20, 1959, and graduated magna cum laude, first in his class of 117.\nHe received a Woodrow Wilson fellowship to study American history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he remained for three years. There he met Howard Morton Wheeler (1940–89), an undergraduate English major from Mobile, Alabama who became his lover and lifelong friend. Later Kīrtanānanda acknowledged that, before becoming a Hare Krishna, he had a homosexual relationship with Wheeler for many years, which was documented in the film Holy Cow, Swami, a 1996 documentary by Jacob Young.\nThe two resigned from the university on February 3, 1961, and left Chapel Hill after being threatened with an investigation over a \"sex scandal\", and moved to New York City. Ham promoted LSD use and became an LSD guru. He worked as an unemployment claims reviewer. He enrolled at Columbia University in 1961, where he received a Waddell fellowship to study religious history with Whitney Cross, but he quit academic life after several years when he and Wheeler traveled to India in October 1965 in search of a guru. Unsuccessful, they returned to New York after six months.\n\nAs Kīrtanānanda\nIn June 1966, after returning from India, Ham met the Bengali Gaudiya Vaishnava guru A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (then known simply as \"Swāmiji\" to his disciples), the founder-acharya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), more popularly known in the West as the Hare Krishnas. After attending Bhagavad-gita classes at the modest storefront temple at 26 Second Avenue in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Ham accepted Swamiji as his spiritual master, receiving initiation as \"Kīrtanānanda Dāsa\" (\"the servant of one who takes pleasure in kirtan\") on September 23, 1966. Swamiji sometimes called him \"Kitchen-ānanda\" because of his cooking expertise. Howard Wheeler was initiated two weeks earlier on September 9, 1966, and received the name \"Hayagriva Dāsa\".\nKīrtanānanda was among the first of Swāmiji's western disciples to shave his head (apart from the sikha), don robes (traditional Bengali Vaishnava clothing consists of dhoti and kurta), and move into the temple. In March 1967, on the order of Swāmiji,  Kīrtanānanda and Janus Dambergs (Janardana Dāsa), a French-speaking university student, established the Montreal Hare Krishna temple. On August 28, 1967, while traveling with Swāmiji in India, Kīrtanānanda Dāsa became Prabhupāda's first disciple to be initiated into the Vaishnava order of renunciation (sannyasa: a lifelong vow of celibacy in mind, word, and body), and received the name Kīrtanānanda Swāmi. Within weeks, however, he returned to New York City against Prabhupāda's wishes and attempted to add esoteric cultural elements of Christianity to Prabhupāda's devotional bhakti system. Other disciples of Prabhupāda saw this as a takeover attempt. In letters from India, Prabhupāda soundly chastised him and banned him from preaching in ISKCON temples.\n\nThe New Vrindaban Community\nKīrtanānanda lived with Wheeler, by then known as Hayagriva Dasa, who was teaching English at a community college in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. In the San Francisco Oracle (an underground newspaper), Kīrtanānanda saw a letter from Richard Rose, Jr., who wanted to form an ashram on his land in Marshall County, West Virginia. \"The conception is one of a non-profit, non-interfering, non-denominational retreat or refuge, where philosophers might come to work communally together, or independently, where a library and other facilities might be developed.\"\nOn a weekend free of classes (March 30–31, 1968), Kīrtanānanda and Hayagriva visited the two properties owned by Rose. After Hayagriva returned to Wilkes Barre, Kīrtanānanda stayed on in Rose's backwoods farmhouse. In July 1968, after a few months of Kīrtanānanda's living in isolation, he and Hayagriva visited Prabhupada in Montreal. Prabhupāda \"forgave his renegade disciples in Montreal with a garland of roses and a shower of tears\". When the pair returned to West Virginia, Richard Rose, Jr. and his wife Phyllis gave Hayagriva a 99-year lease on the 132.77-acre property for $4,000, with an option to purchase for $10 when the lease expired. Hayagriva put down a $1,500 deposit.\n\nPrabhupāda established the purpose and guided the development of the community in dozens of letters and four personal visits (1969, 1972, 1974 and 1976). New Vrindaban would highlight five key elements for ISKCON: \n\nCow Protection and local agriculture,\nSimple living,\nHoly pilgrimage,\nSpiritual education,\nAnd above all, loving Krishna.\nKīrtanānanda eventually established himself as leader and sole authority of the community. In New Vrindaban publications from the late 1970s through the 1980s he was honored as \"Founder-Acharya\" of New Vrindaban, in imitation of Prabhupada's title of Founder-Acharya of ISKCON. Over time the community expanded, devotees from other ISKCON centers moved in, and cows and land were acquired until New Vrindaban properties consisted of nearly 2,500 acres. New Vrindaban became a favorite ISKCON place of pilgrimage and many ISKCON devotees attended the annual Krishna Janmashtami festivals. For some, Kīrtanānanda's previous offenses were forgiven. Many devotees admired him for his austere lifestyle (for a time he lived in an abandoned chicken coop), his preaching skills and devotion to the presiding deities of New Vrindaban: Sri Sri Radha Vrindaban Chandra.\n\nPalace of Gold\nLate in 1972, Kīrtanānanda and sculptor-architect Bhagavatānanda Dāsa decided to build a home for Prabhupāda. In time, the plans for the house developed into an ornate memorial shrine of marble, gold and carved teak wood, dedicated posthumously during Labor Day weekend, on Sunday, September 2, 1979. The completion of the Palace of Gold catapulted New Vrindaban into mainstream respectability as tens (and eventually hundreds) of thousands of tourists began visiting the Palace each year. A \"Land of Krishna\" theme park and a granite \"Temple of Understanding\" in classical South Indian style were designed to make New Vrindaban a \"Spiritual Disneyland\". The ground-breaking ceremony of the proposed temple on May 31, 1985, was attended by dozens of dignitaries, including a United States congressman from West Virginia. One publication called it \"the most significant and memorable day in the history of New Vrindaban.\"\n\nAssault and ensuing expulsion from ISKCON\nOn October 27, 1985, during a New Vrindaban bricklaying marathon, a crazed and distraught devotee bludgeoned Kīrtanānanda on the head with a heavy steel tamping tool.\nSome close associates began leaving the community. On March 16, 1987, during their annual meeting at Mayapur, India, the ISKCON Governing Body Commission expelled Kīrtanānanda from the society for various deviations. They claimed he had defied ISKCON policies and had claimed to be the sole spiritual heir to Prabhupāda's movement. Thirteen members voted for the resolution, two abstained, and one member, Bhakti Tirtha Swami, voted against the resolution.\nKīrtanānanda then established his own organization, The Eternal Order of the League of Devotees Worldwide, taking several properties with him. By 1988, New Vrindaban had 13 satellite centers in the United States and Canada, including New Vrindaban. New Vrindaban was excommunicated from ISKCON the same year.\n\nCriminal conviction and imprisonment\nIn 1990, the US federal government indicted Kīrtanānanda on five counts of racketeering, six counts of mail fraud, and conspiracy to murder two of his opponents in the Hare Krishna movement (Stephen Bryant and Charles St. Denis). The government claimed that he had illegally amassed a profit of more than $10.5 million over four years. It also charged that he ordered the killings because the victims had threatened to reveal his sexual abuse of minors.\nOn March 29, 1991, Kīrtanānanda was convicted on nine of the 11 charges (the jury failed to reach a verdict on the murder charges), but the Court of Appeals, convinced by the arguments of defense attorney Alan Morton Dershowitz, threw out the convictions, saying that child molestation evidence had unfairly prejudiced the jury against Kīrtanānanda, who was not charged with those crimes. On August 16, 1993, he was released from house arrest in a rented apartment in the Wheeling neighborhood of Warwood, where he had lived for nearly two years, and returned triumphantly to New Vrindaban.\nKīrtanānanda lost his iron grip on the community after the September 1993 \"Winnebago Incident\" during which he was accidentally discovered in a compromising position with a teenage boy in the back of a Winnebago van, and the community split into two camps: those who still supported Kīrtanānanda and those who challenged his leadership. During this time he retired to his rural retreat at \"Silent Mountain\" near Littleton, West Virginia.\nThe challengers eventually ousted Kīrtanānanda and his supporters completely, and ended the \"interfaith era\" in July 1994 by returning the temple worship services to the standard Indian style advocated by Swami Prabhupada and practiced throughout ISKCON. Most of Kīrtanānanda's followers left New Vrindaban and moved to the Radha Muralidhar Temple in New York City, which remained under Kīrtanānanda's control. New Vrindaban returned to ISKCON in 1998.\nIn 1996, before Kīrtanānanda's retrial was completed, he pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering (mail fraud). He was sentenced to 20 years in prison but was released on June 16, 2004, because of poor health.\nOn September 10, 2000, the ISKCON Child Protection Office concluded a 17-month investigation and determined that Kīrtanānanda had molested two boys. He was prohibited from visiting any ISKCON properties for five years and offered conditions for reinstatement within ISKCON:\n\nHe must contribute at least $10,000 to an organization dedicated to serving Vaishnava youth, such as Children of Krishna, the Association for the Protection of Vaishnava Children, or a gurukula approved by the APVC.\nHe must write apology letters to all the victims described in this letter. In these letters he must fully acknowledge his transgressions of child abuse, and he must take full responsibility for those actions. Also, he must express appropriate remorse, and offer to make amends to the victims. These letters should be sent to the APVC, not directly to the victims.\nHe must undergo a psychological evaluation by a mental health professional pre-approved by the APVC, and he must comply with recommendations for ongoing therapy described in the evaluation report and by the APVC.\nHe must fully comply with all governmental investigations into misconduct on his part.\nKīrtanānanda never satisfied any of these conditions.\n\nAfter imprisonment\nFor four years after his release from prison, Kīrtanānanda (now using a wheelchair) resided at the Radha Murlidhara Temple at 25 First Avenue in New York City, which was purchased in 1990 for $500,000 and maintained by a small number of disciples and followers, although the temple board later attempted to evict him.\nOn March 7, 2008, Kīrtanānanda left the United States for India, where he expected to remain for the rest of his life. \"There is no sense in staying where I'm not wanted,\" he explained, referring to the desertions through the years by most of his American disciples and to the attempts  to evict him from the building. At the time of his death Kīrtanānanda still had a significant number of loyal disciples in India and Pakistan, who worshiped him as \"guru\" and published his last books. He continued preaching a message of interfaith: that the God of the Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Vaishnavas is the same; and that men of faith from each religion should recognize and appreciate the faith of men of other paths. \"Fundamentalism is one of the most dangerous belief-systems in the world today. Fundamentalism doesn't promote unity; it causes separatism. It creates enmity between people of faith. Look at the Muslims; Mohammed never intended that his followers should spread their religion by the sword. It is more important today than at any other time to preach about the unity of all religions.\"\n\nDeath\nKīrtanānanda died on October 24, 2011, at a hospital in Thane, near Mumbai, India, aged 74. His brother, Gerald Ham, reported the cause of death to be kidney failure.\nHe named Madhusudan Das (popularly known as ‘Bapuji’), of Anand Vrindavan Dham in Ulhasnagar, Mumbai, as his material and spiritual successor.\n\nBibliography\nKīrtanānanda Swami authored two dozen published books, some of which were translated and published in Gujarati, German, French and Spanish editions.

It is popular in Fujian and has spread to other areas including the Ryukyus, Taiwan, and parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia and the Malaysian towns of Sitiawan, Sibu, Ayer Tawar, Sarikei, Bintangor and other places where the dominant Chinese community is of Fuzhou (alternatively romanized as \"Foochow\") and Fuqing ancestry (where it is sometimes nicknamed \"Foochow bagels\").\n\nHistory\nKompia was named after Qi Jiguang, who invented it. When Qi Jiguang led his troops into Fujian in 1563, the Japanese pirates, fearing his name, engaged mainly in guerrilla-style battles. Qi Jiguang noticed that the Japanese pirates could always trace where his troops camped because of the smoke that rose up to the sky when the soldiers prepared their meals. He found out the Japanese pirates had no such problem because they brought onigiri with them. So Qi Jiguang invented a kind of bread with a hole in the center so that they could be strung together to be conveniently carried along. Later, to commemorate Qi Jiguang's victory against the pirate raiders, the bread was named after him as guāng-bǐng (or \"Guang cake\").\n\nIngredients\nKompia is made with lard, onions, salt and flour. A ball of flour is stuffed with a filling of other desired ingredients and flattened with a rolling pin. It is then slapped onto the sides of a traditional home-made Chinese oven and takes approximately 15 minutes to bake.  Meat is often used as a filling in the bread.\n\nVariants\nA variant with sesame seeds scattered on top and baked without any filling is known as 麻饼. A sweet variant known as 征东饼 (literally \"Conquest of the East cake\") uses a proportion of sugar to substitute the salt in the dough.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Tess is a 1979 drama film directed by Roman Polanski and starring Nastassja Kinski, Peter Firth, and Leigh Lawson. It is an adaptation of Thomas Hardy's 1891 novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles. The screenplay was written by Gérard Brach, John Brownjohn, and Roman Polanski. The film received positive critical reviews upon release and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning three for Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.\n\nPlot\nThe story takes place in Thomas Hardy's Wessex during the 1880s.\nThe events of the story are set in motion when a clergyman, Parson Tringham, has a chance conversation with John Durbeyfield, a simple villager. Tringham is a local historian, and in the course of his research he has discovered the \"Durbeyfields\" are descended from the d'Urbervilles, a noble family whose lineage extends to the time of William the Conqueror. The family lost its land and prestige when the male heirs died out. The parson thinks Durbeyfield might like to know his origins as a passing historical curiosity.\nDurbeyfield soon becomes fixated upon the idea of using his noble lineage to better his family's fortunes. Finding a wealthy family named d'Urberville living nearby, he and his wife send their daughter Tess to call on his presumed relations, and seek employment at the manor house. At the manor house live Alec d'Urberville and his mother. Tess is a beautiful girl, and Alec d'Urberville has an appetite for women. Alec and his mother know they are no relation to Tess, for their family name and coat of arms were purchased. Finding her naive, penniless and attractive, he sets about taking advantage of the situation. He tries to get her alone, and attempts to seduce her with strawberries and roses, but these efforts are parried by Tess. In time, he rapes her.\nFor a time they grow closer, but after four months at the manor Tess returns home, and soon discovers she is pregnant. She is angry with her mother for placing her at risk when she knows so little of the world's cruelty. The baby is born sickly and dies. Sometime later, Tess goes to a dairy farm to work as a milkmaid. She meets Angel Clare, an aspiring young farmer from a respectable family. He believes Tess to be an unspoiled country girl, and completely innocent. The two fall in love, but Tess does not reveal her previous relationship with Alec until their wedding night. Disillusioned and heartbroken by the news, Angel rejects her.\nDeserted by her husband, Tess meets Alec d'Urberville again. She at first angrily rebuffs his advances, but the death of her father puts the family in desperately hard times. Facing starvation, eviction and homelessness, Tess submits to Alec to support her mother and siblings.\nShortly afterwards, Angel Clare returns from travelling abroad. A disastrous missionary tour in Brazil has ruined his health. Humbled, and having had plenty of time to think, he feels remorse for his treatment of Tess. He succeeds in tracking her down but leaves heartbroken when he finds her living with Alec. Tess realizes that going back to Alec has ruined her chances of happiness with Angel, and she murders Alec.\nRunning away to find Angel, Tess is reconciled with him; he can finally accept and embrace her as his wife without passing moral judgment on her actions. They consummate their marriage, spending two nights of happiness together on the run from the law before Tess is captured sleeping at Stonehenge. An ending summary tells that she is convicted and hanged for murder.\n\nCast\nProduction\nDevelopment\nPolanski was inspired to make the film by his wife Sharon Tate, who gave him a copy of Tess of the d'Urbervilles. She said it would make a great film and expressed interest in playing the part of Tess. It was the last time Polanski saw her alive, as she was departing back for America while he stayed on a while longer in Europe to finish working on a film. She was murdered by the Manson Family on 9 August 1969 while he was away. She was eight and a half months pregnant with their son, Paul Richard Polanski. The film is dedicated to her (\"To Sharon\") at the beginning.\n\nScreenplay\nPolanski wrote the screenplay in French with his usual collaborator Gérard Brach, then it was translated and expanded by John Brownjohn. The story line largely follows that of the book, although the role of Alec d'Urberville is toned down.\n\nFilming\nSet in Dorset, England, the film was shot at various locations in France: Normandy (Cotentin, la Hague, Omonville-la-Rogue, Éculleville, Sainte-Croix-Hague, le Vast, Bricquebec, Saint-Jacques-de-Néhou, Hermanville-sur-Mer), Brittany (Locronan, le Leslay, Plomelin), and Nord-Pas-de-Calais (Condette). Scenes were also shot at the château de Brocéliande in Paimpont. The megalithic site of Stonehenge was reconstructed in Morienval, a village located in Oise. Polanski was living in Europe as he was wanted as a fugitive after his conviction for sex with an underage girl in the United States. He had fled before sentencing and could have been extradited to the U.S. from the United Kingdom.\nDuring the third month of shooting, on 28 October 1978, the cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth died of a heart attack. Most of the scenes he had shot were exteriors that occur in the first half of the film. Ghislain Cloquet shot the remainder of the film, including most of the interior scenes. Both Unsworth and Cloquet were nominated and won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography. Cloquet alone was nominated for the César Award for Cinematography, which he won.\n\nMusic\nThe original musical score was composed by Philippe Sarde and orchestrated by Peter Knight. It was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The melody played by the character Angel Clare on a recorder is a popular Polish folk song \"Laura i Filon\".\n\nProduction notes\nCostumes for the film were designed by Anthony Powell. He received his third Academy Award for this work.\nPolanski intended the film to reflect an ancient peasant culture, which he had seen in Poland during World War II after fleeing the Kraków ghetto. The scenes also refer to the genre painting of the French artists Georges de La Tour of the 17th century and Gustave Courbet of the 19th century.\n\nRelease\nTess was released in theaters in the United States on 12 December 1980. During its entire theatrical run, the film grossed little over US$20 million (equivalent to US$67 million in 2023) in the United States, which made it the 33rd highest-grossing film of 1980.\n\nAlternate versions\nThe film premiered in France in 1979 at a length of 186 minutes. Polanski writes in his autobiography that he felt that the cut was incomplete, and rushed to meet the release date. The film premiered in 1980 in the U.S. at a re-edited length of 170 minutes. Later, overseas releases of the film in theaters and on home video ran as little as 136 minutes. The 170-minute cut is Polanski's approved version of the film. This version recently was restored in 4K from the original negative under Polanski's supervision, and he attended its premiere at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 81% based on reviews from 77 critics, with an average rating of 7.3/10 with the consensus: \"A reverent adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel, Tess marries painterly cinematography and unhurried pacing to create an epic ode to perseverance.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 82 out of 100 based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nIn a review in The New York Times, Janet Maslin described Tess as \"a lovely, lyrical, unexpectedly delicate movie\".\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars and wrote: \"This is a wonderful film; the kind of exploration of doomed young sexuality that, like Elvira Madigan, makes us agree that the lovers should never grow old.\"\nThe film is one of Polanski's rare love stories, and is one of his most highly acclaimed works.\n\nAccolades\nTess was nominated for six awards, including Best Picture, at the 53rd Academy Awards and won three. It was also nominated for four Golden Globe Awards (winning two), three British Academy Film Awards (winning one) and six César Awards (winning three).\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nTess at IMDb\nTess at AllMovie\nTess at the TCM Movie Database\nTess at Box Office Mojo\nThe Truest Tess an essay by Colin MacCabe at the Criterion Collection"

        "content": "The Communist Party USA, officially the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA), is a communist party in the United States which was established in 1919 after a split in the Socialist Party of America following the Russian Revolution.\nThe history of the CPUSA is closely related to the history of the American labor movement and the history of communist parties worldwide. Initially operating underground due to the Palmer Raids, which started during the First Red Scare, the party was influential in American politics in the first half of the 20th century. It also played a prominent role in the history of the labor movement from the 1920s through the 1940s, playing a key role in the founding of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The party was unique among labor activist groups of the time in being outspokenly anti-racist and opposed to racial segregation after sponsoring the defense for the Scottsboro Boys in 1931. The party reached the apex of its influence in US politics during the Great Depression, playing a prominent role in the political landscape as a militant grassroots network capable of effectively organizing and mobilizing workers and the unemployed in support of cornerstone New Deal programs, principally Social Security, unemployment insurance, and the Works Progress Administration.\nThe transformative changes of the New Deal era combined with the US alliance with the Soviet Union during World War II created an atmosphere in which the CPUSA wielded considerable influence with about 70,000 vetted party members. Under the leadership of Earl Browder, the party was critically supportive of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and branded communism as \"20th Century Americanism\". Envisioning itself as becoming engrained within the established political structure in the post-war era, the party was dissolved in 1944 to become the 'Communist Political Association.' However, as Cold War hostility ensued, the party was restored but struggled to maintain its influence amidst the prevalence of McCarthyism (also known as the Second Red Scare). Its opposition to the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine failed to gain traction, and its endorsed candidate Henry A. Wallace of the Progressive Party under-performed in the 1948 presidential election. The party itself imploded following the public condemnation of Stalin by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956, with membership sinking to a few thousand who were increasingly alienated from the rest of the American Left for their support of the Soviet Union.\nThe CPUSA received significant funding from the Soviet Union and crafted its public positions to match those of Moscow. The CPUSA also used a covert apparatus to assist the Soviets with their intelligence activities in the United States and utilized a network of front organizations to shape public opinion. The CPUSA opposed glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union. As a result, major funding from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ended in 1991.\n\nHistory\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, the Communist Party was influential in various struggles. Historian Ellen Schrecker concludes that decades of recent scholarship offer \"a more nuanced portrayal of the party as both a Stalinist sect tied to a vicious regime and the most dynamic organization within the American Left during the 1930s and '40s.\" It was also the first political party in the United States to be \"fully\" racially integrated.\nBy August 1919, only months after its founding, the Communist Party claimed to have 50,000 to 60,000 members. Its members also included anarchists and other radical leftists. At the time, the older and more moderate Socialist Party of America, suffering from criminal prosecutions for its antiwar stance during World War I, had declined to 40,000 members. The sections of the Communist Party's International Workers Order (IWO) organized for communism around linguistic and ethnic lines, providing mutual aid and tailoring cultural activities to an IWO membership that peaked at 200,000 at its height.\nDuring the Great Depression, some Americans were attracted by the visible activism of Communists on behalf of a wide range of social and economic causes, including the rights of African Americans, workers, and the unemployed. The Communist Party played a significant role in the resurgence of organized labor in the 1930s. Others, alarmed by the rise of the Falangists in Spain and the Nazis in Germany, admired the Soviet Union's early and staunch opposition to fascism. Party membership swelled from 7,500 at the start of the decade to 55,000 by its end.\nParty members also rallied to the defense of the Spanish Republic during this period after a nationalist military uprising moved to overthrow it, resulting in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, along with leftists throughout the world, raised funds for medical relief while many of its members made their way to Spain with the aid of the party to join the Lincoln Brigade, one of the International Brigades.\n\nThe Communist Party was adamantly opposed to fascism during the Popular Front period. Although membership in the party rose to about 66,000 by 1939, nearly 20,000 members left the party by 1943. While general secretary Browder at first attacked Germany for its September 1, 1939 invasion of western Poland, on September 11 the Communist Party received a communique from Moscow denouncing the Polish government. Between September 14–16, party leaders bickered about the direction to take.\nOn September 17, the Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland and occupied the Polish territory assigned to it by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, followed by coordination with German forces in Poland. The Communist Party then turned the focus of its public activities from anti-fascism to advocating peace, opposing military preparations. The party criticized British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French leader Édouard Daladier, but it did not at first attack President Roosevelt, reasoning that this could devastate American Communism, blaming instead Roosevelt's advisors. The party spread the slogans \"The Yanks Are Not Coming\" and \"Hands Off,\" set up a \"perpetual peace vigil\" across the street from the White House, and announced that Roosevelt was the head of the \"war party of the American bourgeoisie.\" The party was active in the isolationist America First Committee. In October and November, after the Soviets invaded Finland and forced mutual assistance pacts from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Communist Party considered Russian security sufficient justification to support the actions. The Comintern and its leader Georgi Dimitrov demanded that Browder change the party's support for Roosevelt. On October 23, the party began attacking Roosevelt. The party changed this policy again after Hitler broke the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact by attacking the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941.\nIn August 1940, after NKVD agent Ramón Mercader killed Trotsky with an ice axe, Browder perpetuated Moscow's line that the killer, who had been dating one of Trotsky's secretaries, was a disillusioned follower. \nThe Communist Party's early labor and organizing successes did not last long. As the decades progressed, the combined effects of McCarthyism (also known as the Second Red Scare) and Nikita Khrushchev's 1956 \"Secret Speech\" in which he denounced the previous decades of Joseph Stalin's rule and the adversities of the continuing Cold War mentality, steadily weakened the party's internal structure and confidence. Party membership in the Communist International and its close adherence to the political positions of the Soviet Union gave most Americans the impression that the party was not only a threatening, subversive domestic entity, but that it was also a foreign agent that espoused an ideology which was fundamentally alien and threatening to the American way of life. Internal and external crises swirled together, to the point when members who did not end up in prison for party activities either tended to disappear quietly from its ranks, or they tended to adopt more moderate political positions which were at odds with the party line. By 1957, membership had dwindled to less than 10,000, of whom some 1,500 were informants for the FBI. The party was also banned by the Communist Control Act of 1954, although it was never really enforced and Congress later repealed most provisions of the act, also with some declared unconstitutional via the court system.\nThe party attempted to recover with its opposition to the Vietnam War during the civil rights movement in the 1960s, but its continued uncritical support for an increasingly stultified and militaristic Soviet Union further alienated it from the rest of the left-wing in the United States, which saw this supportive role as outdated and even dangerous. At the same time, the party's aging membership demographics distanced it from the New Left in the United States.\nWith the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev and his effort to radically alter the Soviet economic and political system from the mid-1980s, the Communist Party finally became estranged from the leadership of the Soviet Union itself. In 1989, the Soviet Communist Party cut off major funding to the Communist Party USA due to its opposition to glasnost and perestroika. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the party held its convention and attempted to resolve the issue of whether the party should reject Marxism–Leninism. The majority reasserted the party's now purely Marxist outlook, prompting a minority faction which urged social democrats to exit the now reduced party. The party has since adopted Marxism–Leninism within its program. In 2014, the new draft of the party constitution declared: \"We apply the scientific outlook developed by Marx, Engels, Lenin and others in the context of our American history, culture, and traditions.\"\n\nThe Communist Party is based in New York City. From 1922 to 1988, it published Morgen Freiheit, a daily newspaper written in Yiddish. For decades, its West Coast newspaper was the People's World and its East Coast newspaper was The Daily World. The two newspapers merged in 1986 into the People's Weekly World. The People's Weekly World has since become an online only publication called People's World. It has since ceased being an official Communist Party publication as the party does not fund its publication. The party's former theoretical journal Political Affairs is now also published exclusively online, but the party still maintains International Publishers as its publishing house. In June 2014, the party held its 30th National Convention in Chicago. The party's 31st National Convention in 2019 celebrated the party's 100th year since its founding.\nThe party announced on April 7, 2021, that it intended to run candidates in elections again, after a hiatus of over thirty years. Steven Estrada, who ran for city council in Long Beach, was one of the first candidates to run as an open member of the CPUSA again (although Long Beach local elections are officially non-partisan). Estrada received 8.5% of the vote.\n\nBeliefs\nConstitution program\nAccording to the constitution of the party adopted at the 30th National Convention in 2014, the Communist Party operates on the principle of democratic centralism, its highest authority being the quadrennial National Convention. Article VI, Section 3 of the 2001 Constitution laid out certain positions as non-negotiable:\n\n[S]truggle for the unity of the working class, against all forms of national oppression, national chauvinism, discrimination and segregation, against all racist ideologies and practices, ... against all manifestations of male supremacy and discrimination against women, ... against homophobia and all manifestations of discrimination against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender people.\nAmong the points in the party's \"Immediate Program\" are a $15/hour minimum wage for all workers, national universal health care, and opposition to privatization of Social Security. Economic measures such as increased taxes on \"the rich and corporations, strong regulation of the financial industry, regulation and public ownership of utilities,\" and increased federal aid to cities and states are also included in the Immediate Program, as are opposition to the Iraq War and other military interventions; opposition to free trade treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); nuclear disarmament and a reduced military budget; various civil rights provisions; campaign finance reform including public financing of campaigns; and election law reform, including instant runoff voting.\n\nBill of rights socialism\nThe Communist Party emphasizes a vision of socialism as an extension of American democracy. Seeking to \"build socialism in the United States based on the revolutionary traditions and struggles\" of American history, the party promotes a conception of \"Bill of Rights Socialism\" that will \"guarantee all the freedoms we have won over centuries of struggle and also extend the Bill of Rights to include freedom from unemployment\" as well as freedom \"from poverty, from illiteracy, and from discrimination and oppression.\"\nReiterating the idea of property rights in socialist society as it is outlined in Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels's Communist Manifesto (1848), the Communist Party emphasizes:\n\nMany myths have been propagated about socialism. Contrary to right-wing claims, socialism would not take away the personal private property of workers, only the private ownership of major industries, financial institutions, and other large corporations, and the excessive luxuries of the super-rich.\nRather than making all wages entirely equal, the Communist Party holds that building socialism would entail \"eliminating private wealth from stock speculation, from private ownership of large corporations, from the export of capital and jobs, and from the exploitation of large numbers of workers.\"\n\nLiving standards\nAmong the primary concerns of the Communist Party are the problems of unemployment, underemployment and job insecurity, which the party considers the natural result of the profit-driven incentives of the capitalist economy:\n\nMillions of workers are unemployed, underemployed, or insecure in their jobs, even during economic upswings and periods of 'recovery' from recessions. Most workers experience long years of stagnant and declining real wages, while health and education costs soar. Many workers are forced to work second and third jobs to make ends meet. Most workers now average four different occupations during their lifetime, many involuntarily moved from job to job and career to career. Often, retirement-age workers are forced to continue working just to provide health care for themselves and their families. Millions of people continuously live below the poverty level; many suffer homelessness and hunger. Public and private programs to alleviate poverty and hunger do not reach everyone, and are inadequate even for those they do reach. With capitalist globalization, jobs move from place to place as capitalists export factories and even entire industries to other countries in a relentless search for the lowest wages.\nThe Communist Party believes that \"class struggle starts with the fight for wages, hours, benefits, working conditions, job security, and jobs. But it also includes an endless variety of other forms for fighting specific battles: resisting speed-up, picketing, contract negotiations, strikes, demonstrations, lobbying for pro-labor legislation, elections, and even general strikes\". The Communist Party's national programs considers workers who struggle \"against the capitalist class or any part of it on any issue with the aim of improving or defending their lives\" part of the class struggle.\n\nImperialism and war\nThe Communist Party maintains that developments within the foreign policy of the United States—as reflected in the rise of neoconservatives and other groups associated with right-wing politics—have developed in tandem with the interests of large-scale capital such as the multinational corporations. The state thereby becomes thrust into a proxy role that is essentially inclined to help facilitate \"control by one section of the capitalist class over all others and over the whole of society\".\nAccordingly, the Communist Party holds that right-wing policymakers such as the neoconservatives, steering the state away from working-class interests on behalf of a disproportionately powerful capitalist class, have \"demonized foreign opponents of the U.S., covertly funded the right-wing-initiated civil war in Nicaragua, and gave weapons to the Saddam Hussein dictatorship in Iraq. They picked small countries to invade, including Panama and Grenada, testing new military equipment and strategy, and breaking down resistance at home and abroad to U.S. military invasion as a policy option\".\nFrom its ideological framework, the Communist Party understands imperialism as the pinnacle of capitalist development: the state, working on behalf of the few who wield disproportionate power, assumes the role of proffering \"phony rationalizations\" for economically driven imperial ambition as a means to promote the sectional economic interests of big business.\nIn opposition to what it considers the ultimate agenda of the conservative wing of American politics, the Communist Party rejects foreign policy proposals such as the Bush Doctrine, rejecting the right of the American government to attack \"any country it wants, to conduct war without end until it succeeds everywhere, and even to use 'tactical' nuclear weapons and militarize space. Whoever does not support the U.S. policy is condemned as an opponent. Whenever international organizations, such as the United Nations, do not support U.S. government policies, they are reluctantly tolerated until the U.S. government is able to subordinate or ignore them\".\nJuxtaposing the support from the Republicans and the right-wing of the Democratic Party for the Bush administration-led invasion of Iraq with the many millions of Americans who opposed the invasion of Iraq from its beginning, the Communist Party notes the spirit of opposition towards the war coming from the American public:\n\nThousands of grassroots peace committees [were] organized by ordinary Americans ... neighborhoods, small towns and universities expressing opposition in countless creative ways. Thousands of actions, vigils, teach-ins and newspaper advertisements were organized. The largest demonstrations were held since the Vietnam War. 500,000 marched in New York after the war started. Students at over 500 universities conducted a Day of Action for \"Books not Bombs.\"\nOver 150 anti-war resolutions were passed by city councils. Resolutions were passed by thousands of local unions and community organizations. Local and national actions were organized on the Internet, including the \"Virtual March on Washington DC\" .... Elected officials were flooded with millions of calls, emails and letters.\n\nIn an unprecedented development, large sections of the US labor movement officially opposed the war. In contrast, it took years to build labor opposition to the Vietnam War. ... For example in Chicago, labor leaders formed Labor United for Peace, Justice and Prosperity. They concluded that mass education of their members was essential to counter false propaganda, and that the fight for the peace, economic security and democratic rights was interrelated.\nThe party has consistently opposed American involvement in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the First Gulf War and the post-September 11 conflicts in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThe Communist Party does not believe that the threat of terrorism can be resolved through war.\n\nWomen and minorities\nThe Communist Party Constitution defines the U.S. working class as \"multiracial and multinational. It unites men and women, young and old, gay and straight, native-born and immigrant, urban and rural.\" The party further expands its interpretation to include the employed and unemployed, organized and unorganized, and of all occupations.\nThe Communist Party seeks equal rights for women, equal pay for equal work and the protection of reproductive rights, together with putting an end to sexism. They support the right of abortion and social services to provide access to it, arguing that unplanned pregnancy is prejudiced against poor women. The party's ranks include a Women's Equality Commission, which recognizes the role of women as an asset in moving towards building socialism.\nHistorically significant in American history as an early fighter for African Americans' rights and playing a leading role in protesting the lynchings of African Americans in the South, the Communist Party in its national program today calls racism the \"classic divide-and-conquer tactic\". From its New York City base, the Communist Party's Ben Davis Club and other Communist Party organizations have been involved in local activism in Harlem and other African American and minority communities. The Communist Party was instrumental in the founding of the progressive Black Radical Congress in 1998, as well as the African Blood Brotherhood.\nHistorically significant in Latino working class history as a successful organizer of the Mexican American working class in the Southwestern United States in the 1930s, the Communist Party regards working-class Latino people as another oppressed group targeted by overt racism as well as systemic discrimination in areas such as education and sees the participation of Latino voters in a general mass movement in both party-based and nonpartisan work as an essential goal for major left-wing progress.\nThe Communist Party holds that racial and ethnic discrimination not only harms minorities, but is pernicious to working-class people of all backgrounds as any discriminatory practices between demographic sections of the working class constitute an inherently divisive practice responsible for \"obstructing the development of working-class consciousness, driving wedges in class unity to divert attention from class exploitation, and creating extra profits for the capitalist class\".\nThe Communist Party supports an end to racial profiling. The party supports continued enforcement of civil rights laws as well as affirmative action.\n\nGeography\nThe Communist Party garnered support in particular communities, developing a unique geography. Instead of a broad nationwide support, support for the party was concentrated in different communities at different times, depending on the organizing strategy at that moment.\nBefore World War II, the Communist Party had relatively stable support in New York City, Chicago and St. Louis County, Minnesota. However, at times the party also had strongholds in more rural counties such as Sheridan County, Montana (22% in 1932), Iron County, Wisconsin (4% in 1932), or Ontonagon County, Michigan (5% in 1934). Even in the South at the height of Jim Crow, the Communist Party had a significant presence in Alabama. Despite the disenfranchisement of African Americans, the party gained 8% of the votes in rural Elmore County. This was mostly due to the successful biracial organizing of sharecroppers through the Sharecroppers' Union.\nUnlike open mass organizations like the Socialist Party or the NAACP, the Communist Party was a disciplined organization that demanded strenuous commitments and frequently expelled members. Membership levels remained below 20,000 until 1933 and then surged upward in the late 1930s, reaching 66,000 in 1939 and reaching its peak membership of over 75,000 in 1947.\nThe party fielded candidates in presidential and many state and local elections not expecting to win, but expecting loyalists to vote the party ticket. The party mounted symbolic yet energetic campaigns during each presidential election from 1924 through 1940 and many gubernatorial and congressional races from 1922 to 1944.\nThe Communist Party organized the country into districts that did not coincide with state lines, initially dividing it into 15 districts identified with a headquarters city with an additional \"Agricultural District\". Several reorganizations in the 1930s expanded the number of districts.\n\nRelations with other groups\nUnited States labor movement\nThe Communist Party has sought to play an active role in the labor movement since its origins as part of its effort to build a mass movement of American workers to bring about their own liberation through socialist revolution.\n\nSoviet funding and espionage\nFrom 1959 until 1989, when Gus Hall condemned the initiatives taken by Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party received a substantial subsidy from the Soviets. There is at least one receipt signed by Gus Hall in the KGB archives. Starting with $75,000 in 1959, this was increased gradually to $3 million in 1987. This substantial amount reflected the party's loyalty to the Moscow line, in contrast to the Italian and later Spanish and British Communist parties, whose Eurocommunism deviated from the orthodox line in the late 1970s. Releases from the Soviet archives show that all national Communist parties that conformed to the Soviet line were funded in the same fashion. From the Communist point of view, this international funding arose from the internationalist nature of communism itself as fraternal assistance was considered the duty of communists in any one country to give aid to their allies in other countries. From the anti-Communist point of view, this funding represented an unwarranted interference by one country in the affairs of another. The cutoff of funds in 1989 resulted in a financial crisis, which forced the party to cut back publication in 1990 of the party newspaper, the People's Daily World, to weekly publication, the People's Weekly World (see references below).\nSomewhat more controversial than mere funding is the alleged involvement of Communist members in espionage for the Soviet Union. Whittaker Chambers alleged that Sandor Goldberger—also known as Josef Peters, who commonly wrote under the name J. Peters—headed the Communist Party's underground secret apparatus from 1932 to 1938 and pioneered its role as an auxiliary to Soviet intelligence activities. Bernard Schuster, Organizational Secretary of the New York District of the Communist Party, is claimed to have been the operational recruiter and conduit for members of the party into the ranks of the secret apparatus, or \"Group A line\".\nStalin publicly disbanded the Comintern in 1943. A Moscow NKVD message to all stations on September 12, 1943, detailed instructions for handling intelligence sources within the Communist Party after the disestablishment of the Comintern.\nThere are a number of decrypted World War II Soviet messages between NKVD offices in the United States and Moscow, also known as the Venona cables. The Venona cables and other published sources appear to confirm that Julius Rosenberg was responsible for espionage. Theodore Hall, a Harvard-trained physicist who did not join the party until 1952, began passing information on the atomic bomb to the Soviets soon after he was hired at Los Alamos at age 19. Hall, who was known as Mlad by his KGB handlers, escaped prosecution. Hall's wife, aware of his espionage, claims that their NKVD handler had advised them to plead innocent, as the Rosenbergs did, if formally charged.\nIt was the belief of opponents of the Communist Party such as J. Edgar Hoover, longtime director of the FBI; and Joseph McCarthy, for whom McCarthyism is named; and other anti-Communists that the Communist Party constituted an active conspiracy, was secretive, loyal to a foreign power and whose members assisted Soviet intelligence in the clandestine infiltration of American government. This is the traditionalist view of some in the field of Communist studies such as Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes, since supported by several memoirs of ex-Soviet KGB officers and information obtained from the Venona project and Soviet archives.\nAt one time, this view was shared by the majority of the Congress. In the \"Findings and declarations of fact\" section of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. Chap. 23 Sub. IV Sec. 841), it stated:\n\n[T]he Communist Party, although purportedly a political party, is in fact an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the United States. It constitutes an authoritarian dictatorship within a republic ... the policies and programs of the Communist Party are secretly prescribed for it by the foreign leaders ... to carry into action slavishly the assignments given .... [T]he Communist Party acknowledges no constitutional or statutory limitations .... The peril inherent in its operation arises [from] its dedication to the proposition that the present constitutional Government of the United States ultimately must be brought to ruin by any available means, including resort to force and violence ... its role as the agency of a hostile foreign power renders its existence a clear present and continuing danger.\nIn 1993, experts from the Library of Congress traveled to Moscow to copy previously secret archives of the party records, sent to the Soviet Union for safekeeping by party organizers. The records provided an irrefutable link between Soviet intelligence and information obtained by the Communist Party and its contacts in the United States government from the 1920s through the 1940s. Some documents revealed that the Communist Party was actively involved in secretly recruiting party members from African American groups and rural farm workers. Other party records contained further evidence that Soviet sympathizers had indeed infiltrated the State Department, beginning in the 1930s. Included in Communist Party archival records were confidential letters from two American ambassadors in Europe to Roosevelt and a senior State Department official. Thanks to an official in the Department of State sympathetic to the party, the confidential correspondence, concerning political and economic matters in Europe, ended up in the hands of Soviet intelligence.\n\nCounterintelligence\nIn 1952, Jack and Morris Childs, together codenamed SOLO, became FBI informants. As high-ranking officials in the American Communist Party, they informed on the CPUSA for the rest of the Cold War, monitoring the Soviet funding. They also traveled to Moscow and Beijing to meet USSR and PRC leadership. Jack and Morris Childs both received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1987 for their intelligence work. Morris's son stated, \"The CIA could not believe the information the FBI had because the American Communist Party had links directly into the Kremlin.\"\nAccording to intelligence analyst Darren E. Tromblay, the SOLO operation, and the Ad Hoc Committee, were part of \"developing geopolitical awareness\" by the FBI about factors such as the Sino-Soviet split. The Ad Hoc Committee was a group within CPUSA that circulated a pro-Maoist bulletin in the voice of a \"dedicated but rebellious comrade.\" Allegedly an operation, it caused a schism within the CPUSA.\n\nCriminal prosecutions\nWhen the Communist Party was formed in 1919, the United States government was engaged in prosecution of socialists who had opposed World War I and military service. This prosecution was continued in 1919 and January 1920 in the Palmer Raids as part of the First Red Scare. Rank and file foreign-born members of the Communist Party were targeted and as many as possible were arrested and deported while leaders were prosecuted and, in some cases, sentenced to prison terms. In the late 1930s, with the authorization of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the FBI began investigating both domestic Nazis and Communists. In 1940, Congress passed the Smith Act, which made it illegal to advocate, abet, or teach the desirability of overthrowing the government.\nIn 1949, the federal government put Eugene Dennis, William Z. Foster and ten other Communist Party leaders on trial for advocating the violent overthrow of the government. Because the prosecution could not show that any of the defendants had openly called for violence or been involved in accumulating weapons for a proposed revolution, it relied on the testimony of former members of the party that the defendants had privately advocated the overthrow of the government and on quotations from the work of Marx, Lenin and other revolutionary figures of the past. During the course of the trial, the judge held several of the defendants and all of their counsel in contempt of court. All of the remaining eleven defendants were found guilty, and the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of their convictions by a 6–2 vote in Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951). The government then proceeded with the prosecutions of more than 140 members of the party.\nPanicked by these arrests and fearing that the party was dangerously compromised by informants, Dennis and other party leaders decided to go underground and to disband many affiliated groups. The move heightened the political isolation of the leadership while making it nearly impossible for the party to function. The widespread support of action against communists and their associates began to abate after Senator Joseph McCarthy overreached himself in the Army–McCarthy hearings, producing a backlash. The end of the Korean War in 1953 also led to a lessening of anxieties about subversion. The Supreme Court brought a halt to the Smith Act prosecutions in 1957 in its decision in Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298 (1957), which required that the government prove that the defendant had actually taken concrete steps toward the forcible overthrow of the government, rather than merely advocating it in theory.\n\nAfrican Americans\nThe Communist Party played a role in defending the rights of African Americans during its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s. The Alabama Chapter of the Communist Party USA helped organize the unemployed Black workers, the Alabama Sharecroppers' Union and numerous anti-lynching campaigns. Further, the Alabama chapter organized young activists that would later go on to be prominent members in the civil rights movement, such as Rosa Parks. Throughout its history several of the party's leaders and political thinkers have been African Americans. James Ford, Charlene Mitchell, Angela Davis and Jarvis Tyner, the current executive vice chair of the party, all ran as presidential or vice presidential candidates on the party ticket. Others like Benjamin J. Davis, William L. Patterson, Harry Haywood, James Jackson, Henry Winston, Claude Lightfoot, Alphaeus Hunton, Doxey Wilkerson, Claudia Jones, and John Pittman contributed in important ways to the party's approaches to major issues from human and civil rights, peace, women's equality, the national question, working class unity, socialist thought, cultural struggle, and more. African American thinkers, artists and writers such as Claude McKay, Richard Wright, Ann Petry, W. E. B. Du Bois, Shirley Graham Du Bois, Lloyd Brown, Charles White, Elizabeth Catlett, Paul Robeson, Gwendolyn Brooks, and others were one-time members or supporters of the party, and the Communist Party also had a close alliance with Harlem Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr.\n\nGay rights movement\nOne of the most prominent sexual radicals in the United States, Harry Hay, developed his political views as an active member of the Communist Party. Hay founded in the early 1950s the Mattachine Society, America's second gay rights organization. However, gay rights were not seen as something the party should associate with organizationally. Many party members saw homosexuality as something done by those with fascist tendencies (following the lead of the Soviet Union in criminalizing the practice for that reason). Hay was expelled from the party as an ideological risk. In 2004, the editors of Political Affairs published articles detailing their self-criticism of the party's early views of gay and lesbian rights and praised Hay's work.\nThe Communist Party endorsed LGBT rights in a 2005 statement. The party affirmed the resolution with a statement a year later in honor of gay pride month in June 2006.\n\nUnited States peace movement\nThe Communist Party opposed the United States involvement in the early stages of World War II (until June 22, 1941, the date of the German invasion of the Soviet Union), the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the invasion of Grenada, and American support for anti-Communist military dictatorships and movements in Central America. Meanwhile, some in the peace movement and the New Left rejected the Communist Party for what it saw as the party's bureaucratic rigidity and for its close association with the Soviet Union.\nThe Communist Party was consistently opposed to the United States' 2003–2011 war in Iraq. United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ) includes the New York branch of the Communist Party as a member group, with Communist Judith LeBlanc serving as the co-chair of UFPJ from 2007 to 2009.\n\nElection results\nPresidential tickets\nBest results in major races\nParty leaders\nNotable CPUSA members\nSee also\nEnglish-language press of the Communist Party USA (annotated list of titles)\nHistory of Soviet espionage in the United States\nInternational Publishers\nJencks v.

The game was created by Markus \"Notch\" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021, and has been ported to several platforms.\nIn Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (where players have unlimited resources and access to flight). There is also a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.\nMinecraft received critical acclaim, winning several awards and later being cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. Several spin-offs have also been made, including Minecraft: Story Mode,' Minecraft Dungeons, Minecraft Earth, and the upcoming Minecraft Legends.\n\nGameplay\nMinecraft is a  open world sandbox game that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game. However, there is an achievement system, known as \"advancements\" in the Java Edition of the game, and \"trophies\" on the PlayStation ports. Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option of a third-person perspective. The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called \"blocks\"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can \"mine\" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things. Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic. The game also contains a material called redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems.\nThe game world is virtually infinite and procedurally generated as players explore it, using a map seed that is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation (or manually specified by the player). There are limits on vertical movement, but Minecraft allows an infinitely large game world to be generated on the horizontal plane. Due to technical problems when extremely distant locations are reached, however, there is a barrier preventing players from traversing to locations beyond 30,000,000 blocks from the center. The game achieves this by splitting the world data into smaller sections called \"chunks\" that are only created or loaded when players are nearby. The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields; the terrain includes plains, mountains, forests, caves, and bodies of water/lava. The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, with one full cycle lasting for 20 real-time minutes.\nWhen starting a new world, players must choose one of five game modes, as well as one of four difficulties, ranging from \"Peaceful\" to \"Hard\". Increasing the difficulty of the game causes the player to take more damage from mobs, as well as having other difficulty-specific effects. For example, the Peaceful difficulty prevents hostile mobs from spawning, and the Hard difficulty allows players to starve to death if their hunger bar is depleted. Once selected, the difficulty can be changed, but the game mode is locked and can only be changed with cheats.\n\nNew players have a randomly selected default character skin of either Steve or Alex, but the option to create custom skins was made available in 2010. Players encounter various non-player characters known as mobs, such as animals, villagers, and hostile creatures. Passive mobs, such as cows, pigs, and chickens, can be hunted for food and crafting materials. They spawn in the daytime, while hostile mobs—including large spiders, skeletons, and zombies—spawn during nighttime or in dark places such as caves. Some hostile mobs, such as zombies, skeletons and drowned (underwater versions of zombies), burn under the sun if they have no headgear. Other creatures unique to Minecraft include the creeper (an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player) and the enderman (a creature with the ability to teleport as well as pick up and place blocks). There are also variants of mobs that spawn in different conditions; for example, zombies have husk and drowned variants that spawn in deserts and oceans, respectively.\nMinecraft has two alternative dimensions besides the Overworld (the main world): the Nether and the End. The Nether is a hell-like underworld dimension accessed via player-built obsidian portals; it contains many unique resources and can be used to travel great distances in the Overworld, due to every block traveled in the Nether being equivalent to 8 blocks traveled in the Overworld. Water cannot exist in the Nether, as it will vaporize instantly. The Nether is mainly populated by pigman-like mobs called piglins and their zombified counterparts, plus floating balloon-like mobs called ghasts. The player can also build an optional boss mob called The Wither out of materials found in the Nether. \n\nThe End is reached by underground portals in the Overworld. It consists of islands floating above a dark, endless void. A boss dragon called the Ender Dragon guards the largest, central island. Killing the dragon opens access to an exit portal, which upon entering cues the game's ending credits and a poem (the \"End Poem\") written by Irish novelist Julian Gough. Players are then teleported back to their respawn point and may continue the game indefinitely.\n\nGame modes\nSurvival mode\nIn survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items. Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a shelter at night. The mode also has a health bar which is depleted by attacks from mobs, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events. Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game (except in peaceful difficulty). If the hunger bar is depleted, automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete. Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful difficulty.\nPlayers can craft a wide variety of items in Minecraft. Craftable items include armor, which mitigates damage from attacks; weapons (such as swords or axes), which allows monsters and animals to be killed more easily; and tools (such as pickaxes or hoes), which break certain types of blocks more quickly. Some items have multiple tiers depending on the material used to craft them, with higher-tier items being more effective and durable. Players can construct furnaces, which can cook food, process ores, and convert materials into other materials. Players may also exchange goods with a villager (NPC) through a trading system, which involves trading emeralds for different goods and vice versa.\nThe game has an inventory system, allowing players to carry a limited number of items. Upon dying, items in the players' inventories are dropped unless the game is reconfigured not to do so. Players then re-spawn at their spawn point, which by default is where players first spawn in the game and can be reset by sleeping in a bed or using a respawn anchor. Dropped items can be recovered if players can reach them before they disappear or despawn after 5 minutes. Players may acquire experience points by killing mobs and other players, mining, smelting ores, breeding animals, and cooking food. Experience can then be spent on enchanting tools, armor and weapons. Enchanted items are generally more powerful, last longer, or have other special effects.\n\nCreative mode\nIn creative mode, players have access to nearly all resources and items in the game through the inventory menu and can place or remove them instantly. Players can toggle the ability to fly freely around the game world at will, and their characters do not take any damage and are not affected by hunger. The game mode helps players focus on building and creating projects of any size without disturbance.\n\nOther game modes\nMinecraft includes other game modes such as spectator mode, which allows players to fly through blocks. Hardcore mode is a survival mode variant with permadeath, where the world is deleted upon the player's death, and adventure mode is a survivor mode variant with possible restrictions added by a creator of a map.\n\nMultiplayer\nMultiplayer in Minecraft enables multiple players to interact and communicate with each other on a single world. It is available through direct game-to-game multiplayer, LAN play, local split screen (console-only), and servers (player-hosted and business-hosted). Players can run their own servers, use a hosting provider, or connect directly to another player's game via Xbox Live. Single-player worlds have local area network support, allowing players to join a world on locally interconnected computers without a server setup. Minecraft multiplayer servers are guided by server operators, who have access to server commands such as setting the time of day and teleporting players. Operators can also set up restrictions concerning which usernames or IP addresses are allowed or disallowed to enter the server. Multiplayer servers have a wide range of activities, with some servers having their own unique rules and customs. The largest and most popular server is Hypixel, which has been visited by over 14 million unique players. Player versus player combat (PvP) can be enabled to allow fighting between players. Many servers have custom plugins that allow actions that are not normally possible.\n\nMinecraft Realms\nIn 2013, Mojang announced Minecraft Realms, a server hosting service intended to enable players to run server multiplayer games easily and safely without having to set up their own. Unlike a standard server, only invited players can join Realms servers, and these servers do not use IP addresses. Minecraft: Java Edition Realms server owners can invite up to twenty people to play on their server, with up to ten players online at a time. Minecraft Realms server owners can invite up to 3,000 people to play on their server, with up to ten players online at one time. The Minecraft: Java Edition Realms servers do not support user-made plugins, but players can play custom Minecraft maps. Minecraft Realms servers support user-made add-ons, resource packs, behavior packs, and custom Minecraft maps. At Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016, support for cross-platform play between Windows 10, iOS, and Android platforms was added through Realms starting in June 2016, with Xbox One and Nintendo Switch support to come later in 2017, and support for virtual reality devices. On 31 July 2017, Mojang released the beta version of the update allowing cross-platform play. Nintendo Switch support for Realms was released in July 2018.\n\nCustomization\nThe modding community consists of fans, users and third-party programmers. Using a variety of application program interfaces that have arisen over time, they have produced a wide variety of downloadable content for Minecraft, such as modifications, texture packs and custom maps. Modifications of the Minecraft code, called mods, add a variety of gameplay changes, ranging from new blocks, items, and mobs to entire arrays of mechanisms. The modding community is responsible for a substantial supply of mods from ones that enhance gameplay, such as minimaps, waypoints, and durability counters, to ones that add to the game elements from other video games and media. While a variety of mod frameworks were independently developed by reverse engineering the code, Mojang has also enhanced vanilla Minecraft with official frameworks for modification, allowing the production of community-created resource packs, which alter certain game elements including textures and sounds. Players can also create their own \"maps\" (custom world save files) which often contain specific rules, challenges, puzzles and quests, and share them for others to play. Mojang added an adventure mode in August 2012 and \"command blocks\" in October 2012, which were created specially for custom maps in Java Edition. Data packs, introduced in version 1.13 of the Java Edition, allow further customization, including the ability to add new advancements, dimensions, functions, loot tables, predicates, recipes, structures, tags, world generation settings, and biomes‌.\nThe Xbox 360 Edition supports downloadable content, which is available to purchase via the Xbox Games Store; these content packs usually contain additional character skins. It later received support for texture packs in its twelfth title update while introducing \"mash-up packs\", which combines texture packs with skin packs and changes to the game's sounds, music and user interface. The first mash-up pack (and by extension, the first texture pack) for the Xbox 360 Edition was released on 4 September 2013, and was themed after the Mass Effect franchise. Unlike Java Edition, however, the Xbox 360 Edition does not support player-made mods or custom maps. A cross-promotional resource pack based on the Super Mario franchise by Nintendo was released for the Wii U Edition worldwide on 17 May 2016. A mash-up pack based on Fallout was announced for release on the Wii U Edition. In April 2018, malware was discovered in several downloadable user-made Minecraft skins for use with the Java Edition of the game. Avast stated that nearly 50,000 accounts were infected, and when activated, the malware would attempt to reformat the user's hard drive. Mojang promptly patched the issue, and released a statement stating that \"the code would not be run or read by the game itself\", and would only run when the image containing the skin itself was opened.\nIn June 2017, Mojang released an update known as the \"Discovery Update\" to the Bedrock version of the game. The update includes a new map, a new game mode, the \"Marketplace\", a catalogue of user-generated content that gives Minecraft creators \"another way to make a living from the game\", and more.\n\nDevelopment\nBefore coming up with Minecraft, Markus \"Notch\" Persson was a game developer with King through March 2009, at the time serving mostly browser games, during which he learnt a number of different programming languages. He would prototype his own games during his off-hours at home, often based on inspiration he found from other games, and participated frequently on the TIGSource forums for independent developers. One of these personal projects was called \"RubyDung\", a base-building game inspired by Dwarf Fortress, but as an isometric three dimensional game like RollerCoaster Tycoon. He had already made a 3D texture mapper for another zombie game prototype he had started to try to emulate the style of Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars. Among the features in \"RubyDung\" he explored was a first-person view similar to Dungeon Keeper but at the time, felt the graphics were too pixelated and omitted this mode. Around March 2009, Persson left King and joined jAlbum, but otherwise kept working on his prototypes.\nInfiniminer, a block-based open-ended mining game first released in April 2009, sparked Persson's inspiration for how to take \"RubyDung\" forward. Infiniminer heavily influenced the visual style of gameplay, including bringing back the first-person mode, the \"blocky\" visual style and the block-building fundamentals. However, unlike Infiniminer, Persson wanted Minecraft to have RPG elements.\nThe original edition of Minecraft, now known as the Java Edition, was first developed in May 2009. Persson released a test video on YouTube of an early version of Minecraft. The base program of Minecraft was completed by Persson over a weekend in that month and a private testing was released on TigIRC on 16 May 2009. The game was first released to the public on 17 May 2009 as a developmental release on TIGSource forums. Persson updated the game based on feedback from the forums. This version later became known as the Classic version. Further developmental phases dubbed as Survival Test, Indev, and Infdev were released in 2009 and 2010.\nThe first major update, dubbed Alpha, was released on 30 June 2010. Although Persson maintained a day job with Jalbum.net at first, he later quit in order to work on Minecraft full-time as sales of the alpha version of the game expanded. Persson continued to update the game with releases distributed to users automatically. These updates included new items, new blocks, new mobs, survival mode, and changes to the game's behavior (e.g. how water flows). To back the development of Minecraft, Persson set up a video game company, Mojang, with the money earned from the game. Mojang co-founders included Jakob Porser, one of Persson's coworkers from King, and Carl Manneh, jAlbum's CEO.\nOn 11 December 2010, Persson announced that Minecraft was entering its beta testing phase on 20 December 2010. He further stated that bug fixes and all updates leading up to and including the release would still be free. Over the course of the development, Mojang hired several new employees to work on the project.\nMojang moved the game out of beta and released the full version on 18 November 2011. On 1 December 2011, Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten took full creative control over Minecraft, replacing Persson as lead designer. On 28 February 2012, Mojang announced that they had hired the developers of the popular \"Bukkit\" developer API for Minecraft, to improve Minecraft's support of server modifications. This acquisition also included Mojang apparently taking full ownership of the CraftBukkit server mod which enables the use of Bukkit, although the validity of this claim was questioned due to its status as an open-source project with many contributors, licensed under the GNU General Public License and Lesser General Public License.\nOn 15 September 2014, Microsoft announced a $2.5 billion deal to buy Mojang, along with the ownership of the Minecraft intellectual property. The deal was suggested by Persson when he posted a tweet asking a corporation to buy his share of the game after receiving criticism for enforcing terms in the game's end user license agreement (EULA), which had been present in the EULA in the prior three years. According to Persson, Mojang CEO Carl Manneh received a call from a Microsoft executive shortly after the tweet, asking if Persson was serious about a deal. Mojang was also approached by other companies including Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts. The deal with Microsoft was arbitrated on 6 November 2014 and led to Persson becoming one of Forbes' \"World's Billionaires\".\nSince the first full release of Minecraft, dubbed the \"Adventure Update\", the game has been continuously updated with many major updates, available for free to users who have already purchased the game. Early updates frequently introduced gameplay-altering mechanics while more recent updates tend to enhance the game through additional content or tweaks to existing features. The most recent major update to the game was \"The Wild Update\", which released in June 2022 and added new creatures, biomes, and items.\nThe original version of the game was renamed to Minecraft: Java Edition on 18 September 2017 to separate it from Bedrock Edition, which was renamed to just Minecraft by the Better Together Update.\nThe Bedrock Edition has also been regularly updated, with these updates now matching the themes of Java Edition updates. Other versions of the game such as the various console editions and Pocket Edition were either merged into Bedrock or discontinued and as such have not received further updates.\nOn 16 April 2020, a beta version of Minecraft implementing physically based rendering, ray tracing and DLSS was released by Nvidia on RTX-enabled GPUs. The final version was released on 8 December 2020.\n\nMinecraft: Pocket Edition\nIn August 2011, Minecraft: Pocket Edition was released for the Xperia Play on the Android Market as an early alpha version. It was then released for several other compatible devices on 8 October 2011. An iOS version of Minecraft was released on 17 November 2011. A port was made available for Windows Phones shortly after Microsoft acquired Mojang. The port concentrates on the creative building and the primitive survival aspect of the game and does not contain all the features of the PC release. On his Twitter account, Jens Bergensten said that the Pocket Edition of Minecraft is written in C++ and not Java, due to iOS not being able to support Java. However, there now exists a way to play Java Edition on both Android and iOS devices.\nOn 10 December 2014, a port of Pocket Edition was released for Windows Phone 8.1. In January 2017, Microsoft announced that it would no longer maintain the Windows Phone versions of Pocket Edition. On 19 December 2016, the full version of Minecraft: Pocket Edition was released on iOS, Android and Windows Phone.\nPocket Edition was replaced by Minecraft: Bedrock Edition in 2017, enabling cross-platform play with the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch Editions.\n\nLegacy Console Editions\nAn Xbox 360 version of the game, developed by 4J Studios, was released on 9 May 2012. On 22 March 2012, it was announced that Minecraft would be the flagship game in a new Xbox Live promotion called Arcade NEXT. The game differs from the home computer versions in a number of ways, including a newly designed crafting system, the control interface, in-game tutorials, split-screen multiplayer, and the ability to play with friends via Xbox Live. The worlds in the Xbox 360 version are also not \"infinite\", and are essentially barricaded by invisible walls. The Xbox 360 version was originally similar in content to older PC versions, but was gradually updated to bring it closer to the current PC version prior to its discontinuation. An Xbox One version featuring larger worlds among other enhancements was released on 5 September 2014.\nVersions of the game for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 were released on 17 December 2013 and 4 September 2014 respectively. The PlayStation 4 version was announced as a launch title, though it was eventually delayed. A version for PlayStation Vita was also released in October 2014. Like the Xbox versions, the PlayStation versions were developed by 4J Studios.\nOn 17 December 2015, Minecraft: Wii U Edition was released. The Wii U version received a physical release on 17 June 2016 in North America, in Japan on 23 June 2016, and in Europe on 30 June 2016. A Nintendo Switch version of the game was released on the Nintendo eShop on 11 May 2017, along with a physical retail version set for a later date. During a Nintendo Direct presentation on 13 September 2017, Nintendo announced that Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition would be available for download immediately after the livestream, and a physical copy available on a later date. The game is only compatible with the \"New\" versions of the 3DS and 2DS systems and does not work with the original 3DS, 3DS XL, or 2DS models.\nOn 20 September 2017, the Better Together Update was released on the Xbox One, Windows 10, VR, and mobile versions of the game, which used the Pocket Edition engine to enable cross-platform play between each of these versions. This version of the game eventually became known as the Bedrock Edition. Shortly after, the Bedrock Edition was also ported to the Nintendo Switch.\nOn 18 December 2018, the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360, and Wii U versions of Minecraft received their final update and would later become known as Legacy Console Editions.\nThe PlayStation 4 version of Minecraft was updated in December 2019 and became part of the Bedrock Edition, which enabled cross-platform play for users with a free Xbox Live account.\n\nMinecraft: Education Edition\nMinecraft: Education Edition is an educational version of the base game, designed specifically for use in educational establishments such as schools, and built off of the Bedrock Edition codebase. It is available on Windows 10, MacOS, iPadOS and ChromeOS. It includes a Chemistry Resource Pack, free lesson plans on the Minecraft: Education Edition website, and two free companion applications: Code Connection and Classroom Mode.\nAn initial beta test was carried out between 9 June and 1 November 2016. The full game was then released on Windows 10 and MacOS on 1 November 2016. On 20 August 2018, Mojang announced that it would bring Education Edition to iPadOS in Autumn 2018. It was released to the App Store on 6 September 2018. On 27 March 2019, it was announced that the Education Edition would be operated by JD.com in China. On 26 June 2020, a public beta for the Education Edition was made available to Google Play Store compatible Chromebooks. The full game was released to the Google Play Store for Chromebooks on 7 August 2020.\n\nMinecraft China\nOn 20 May 2016, Minecraft China was announced as a localized edition for China, where it was released under a licensing agreement between NetEase and Mojang. The PC edition was released for public testing on 8 August 2017. The iOS version was released on 15 September 2017, and the Android version was released on 12 October 2017. The PC edition is based on the original Java Edition, while the iOS and Android mobile version is based on the Bedrock Edition. The edition is free-to-play and had over 300 million players by November 2019.\n\nOther PC versions\nApart from Minecraft: Java Edition, there are other versions of Minecraft for PC, including Minecraft for Windows, Minecraft Classic, Minecraft 4K, and a version for the Raspberry Pi.\n\nMinecraft for Windows\nMinecraft for Windows is exclusive to Microsoft's Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems. The beta release for Windows 10 launched on the Windows Store on July 29, 2015. \nAfter nearly one and a half years in beta, Microsoft fully released Minecraft for Windows on December 19, 2016. Called the \"Ender Update\", this release implemented new features to this version of Minecraft like world templates and add-on packs. This version has the ability to play with Xbox Live friends, and to play local multiplayer with owners of Minecraft on other Bedrock platforms. Other features include the ability to use multiple control schemes such as a gamepad, keyboard, or touchscreen (for Microsoft Surface and other touchscreen-enabled devices). Virtual reality support has been implemented, as well as the ability to record and take screenshots in-game via the Windows built-in GameDVR.\nAs of 7 June 2022, the Java and Bedrock Editions of Minecraft for Windows were merged into a single title for purchase; those who owned one version would automatically gain access to the other version. Both game modes would otherwise remain separate.\n\nMinecraft 4K\nMinecraft 4K is a simplified version of Minecraft similar to the Classic version that was developed for the Java 4K game programming contest \"in way less than 4 kilobytes\". The map itself is finite—composed of 64×64×64 blocks—and the same world is generated every time. Players are restricted to placing or destroying blocks, which consist of grass, dirt, stone, wood, leaves, and brick.\n\nRaspberry Pi\nA version of Minecraft for the Raspberry Pi was officially revealed at Minecon 2012. The Pi Edition is based on an alpha version of Pocket Edition with the added ability of using text commands to edit the game world. Players can open the game code and use the Python programming language to manipulate things in the game world. It also includes a scripting API to modify the game, and server software for multiplayer. The game was leaked on 20 December 2012, but was quickly pulled off. It was officially released on 11 February 2013. Mojang stopped providing updates to Minecraft: Raspberry Pi Edition in 2016. It is preinstalled on Raspberry Pi OS and can be downloaded for free from the official Minecraft website.\n\nMusic\nMinecraft's music and sound effects were produced by German musician Daniel Rosenfeld, better known as C418. The background music in Minecraft is instrumental ambient music. On 4 March 2011, Rosenfeld released a soundtrack titled Minecraft – Volume Alpha; it includes most of the tracks featured in Minecraft, as well as other music not featured in the game. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku chose the music in Minecraft as one of the best video game soundtracks of 2011. On 9 November 2013, Rosenfeld released the second official soundtrack, titled Minecraft – Volume Beta, which includes the music that was added in later versions of the game. A physical release of Volume Alpha, consisting of CDs, black vinyl, and limited-edition transparent green vinyl LPs, was issued by indie electronic label Ghostly International on 21 August 2015. In addition to Rosenfeld's work, other composers have contributed tracks to the game since release, including Samuel Åberg, Gareth Coker, Lena Raine, and Kumi Tanioka.\n\nVariants\nFor the tenth anniversary of the game's release, Mojang remade a version of Minecraft Classic in JavaScript and made it available to play online. It functions much the same as creative mode, allowing players to build and destroy any and all parts of the world either alone or in a multiplayer server. Environmental hazards such as lava do not damage players, and some blocks function differently since their behavior was later changed during development.\nAround 2011, prior to Minecraft's full release, there had been collaboration between Mojang and The Lego Group to make a Lego brick-based Minecraft game to be called Brickcraft. This would have modified the base Minecraft game to use Lego bricks, which meant adapting the basic 1×1 block to account for larger pieces typically used in Lego sets. Persson had worked on the preliminary version of this game, which he had named \"Project Rex Kwon Do\" based on the joke from Napoleon Dynamite. Lego had greenlit the project to go forward, and while Mojang had put two developers on the game for six months, they later opted to cancel the project, as Mojang felt that the Lego Group were too demanding on what they could do, according to Mojang's Daniel Kaplan. The Lego Group had considered buying out Mojang to complete the game, but at this point Microsoft made its offer to buy the company for over $2 billion. According to the Lego Group's Ronny Scherer, the company was not yet sure of the potential success of Minecraft at this point and backed off from acquisition after Microsoft brought this offer to Mojang.\n\nVirtual reality\nEarly on, Persson planned to support the Oculus Rift with a port of Minecraft. However, after Facebook acquired Oculus in 2013, he abruptly canceled plans noting \"Facebook creeps me out.\" A community-made modification known as Minecraft VR was developed in 2016 to provide virtual reality support to Minecraft: Java Edition oriented towards Oculus Rift hardware. A fork of the Minecraft VR modification known as Vivecraft ported the mod to OpenVR, and is oriented towards supporting HTC Vive hardware. On 15 August 2016, Microsoft launched official Oculus Rift support for Minecraft on Windows 10. Upon its release, the Minecraft VR mod was discontinued by its developer due to trademark complaints issued by Microsoft, and Vivecraft was endorsed by the community makers of the Minecraft VR modification due to its Rift support and being superior to the original Minecraft VR mod. Also available is a Gear VR version, titled Minecraft: Gear VR Edition. Windows Mixed Reality support was added in 2017. On 7 September 2020, Mojang Studios announced that the PlayStation 4 version of the game would be getting PlayStation VR support in the same month. The only officially supported VR versions of Minecraft are the PlayStation 4 version, Minecraft: Gear VR Edition and Minecraft for Windows 10 for Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality headsets.\n\nReception\nCritics\nEarly versions of Minecraft received critical acclaim, praising the creative freedom it grants players in-game, as well as the ease of enabling emergent gameplay. Critics have praised Minecraft's complex crafting system, commenting that it is an important aspect of the game's open-ended gameplay. Most publications were impressed by the game's \"blocky\" graphics, with IGN describing them as \"instantly memorable\". Reviewers also liked the game's adventure elements, noting that the game creates a good balance between exploring and building. The game's multiplayer feature has been generally received favorably, with IGN commenting that \"adventuring is always better with friends\". Jaz McDougall of PC Gamer said Minecraft is \"intuitively interesting and contagiously fun, with an unparalleled scope for creativity and memorable experiences\". It has been regarded as having introduced millions of children to the digital world, insofar as its basic game mechanics are logically analogous to computer commands. \nIGN was disappointed about the troublesome steps needed to set up multiplayer servers, calling it a \"hassle\". Critics also said that visual glitches occur periodically. Despite its release out of beta in 2011, GameSpot said the game had an \"unfinished feel\", adding that some game elements seem \"incomplete or thrown together in haste\".\nA review of the alpha version, by Scott Munro of the Daily Record, called it \"already something special\" and urged readers to buy it. Jim Rossignol of Rock, Paper, Shotgun also recommended the alpha of the game, calling it \"a kind of generative 8-bit Lego Stalker\". On 17 September 2010, gaming webcomic Penny Arcade began a series of comics and news posts about the addictiveness of the game. The Xbox 360 version was generally received positively by critics, but did not receive as much praise as the PC version. Although reviewers were disappointed by the lack of features such as mod support and content from the PC version, they acclaimed the port's addition of a tutorial and in-game tips and crafting recipes, saying that they make the game more user-friendly. The Xbox One Edition was one of the best received ports, being praised for its relatively large worlds.\nThe PlayStation 3 Edition also received generally favorable reviews, being compared to the Xbox 360 Edition and praised for its well-adapted controls. The PlayStation 4 edition was the best received port to date, being praised for having 36 times larger worlds than the PlayStation 3 edition and described as nearly identical to the Xbox One edition. The PlayStation Vita Edition received generally positive reviews from critics but was noted for its technical limitations.\nThe Wii U version received generally positive reviews from critics but was noted for a lack of GamePad integration. The 3DS version received mixed reviews, being criticized for its high price, technical issues, and lack of cross-platform play. The Nintendo Switch Edition received fairly positive reviews from critics, being praised, like other modern ports, for its relatively larger worlds.\nMinecraft: Pocket Edition initially received mixed reviews from critics. Although reviewers appreciated the game's intuitive controls, they were disappointed by the lack of content. The inability to collect resources and craft items, as well as the limited types of blocks and lack of hostile mobs, were especially criticized. After updates added more content, Pocket Edition started receiving more positive reviews. Reviewers complimented the controls and the graphics, but still noted a lack of content.\n\nSales\nMinecraft surpassed over a million purchases less than a month after entering its beta phase in early 2011. At the same time, the game had no publisher backing and has never been commercially advertised except through word of mouth, and various unpaid references in popular media such as the Penny Arcade webcomic. By April 2011, Persson estimated that Minecraft had made €23 million (US$33 million) in revenue, with 800,000 sales of the alpha version of the game, and over 1 million sales of the beta version. In November 2011, prior to the game's full release, Minecraft beta surpassed 16 million registered users and 4 million purchases. By March 2012, Minecraft had become the 6th best-selling PC game of all time. As of 10 October 2014, the game has sold 17 million copies on PC, becoming the best-selling PC game of all time. As of 10 October 2014, the game has sold approximately 60 million copies across all platforms, making it the best-selling video game of all time. On 25 February 2014, the game reached 100 million registered users. By May 2019, 180 million copies had been sold across all platforms, making it the single best-selling video game of all time. The free-to-play Minecraft China version had over 300 million players by November 2019. By April 2021, Minecraft sold more than 238 million copies worldwide.\nThe Xbox 360 version of Minecraft became profitable within the first day of the game's release in 2012, when the game broke the Xbox Live sales records with 400,000 players online. Within a week of being on the Xbox Live Marketplace, Minecraft sold upwards of a million copies. GameSpot announced in December 2012 that Minecraft sold over 4.48 million copies since the game debuted on Xbox Live Arcade in May 2012. In 2012, Minecraft was the most purchased title on Xbox Live Arcade; it was also the fourth most played title on Xbox Live based on average unique users per day. As of 4 April 2014, the Xbox 360 version has sold 12 million copies. In addition, Minecraft: Pocket Edition has reached a figure of 21 million in sales. The PlayStation 3 Edition sold one million copies in five weeks. The release of the game's PlayStation Vita version boosted Minecraft sales by 79%, outselling both PS3 and PS4 debut releases and becoming the largest Minecraft launch on a PlayStation console. The PS Vita version sold 100,000 digital copies in Japan within the first two months of release, according to an announcement by SCE Japan Asia. By January 2015, 500,000 digital copies of Minecraft were sold in Japan across all PlayStation platforms, with a surge in primary school children purchasing the PS Vita version. Minecraft helped improve Microsoft's total first-party revenue by $63 million for the 2015 second quarter.\nThe game, including all of its versions, had over 112 million monthly active players by September 2019. On its 11th anniversary in May 2020, the company announced that Minecraft had reached over 200 million copies sold across platforms with over 126 million monthly active players. By April 2021, the number of active monthly users had climbed to 140 million.\n\nAwards\nIn July 2010, PC Gamer listed Minecraft as the fourth-best game to play at work. In December of that year, Good Game selected Minecraft as their choice for Best Downloadable Game of 2010, Gamasutra named it the eighth best game of the year as well as the eighth best indie game of the year, and Rock, Paper, Shotgun named it the \"game of the year\". Indie DB awarded the game the 2010 Indie of the Year award as chosen by voters, in addition to two out of five Editor's Choice awards for Most Innovative and Best Singleplayer Indie. It was also awarded Game of the Year by PC Gamer UK. The game was nominated for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize, Technical Excellence, and Excellence in Design awards at the March 2011 Independent Games Festival and won the Grand Prize and the community-voted Audience Award. At Game Developers Choice Awards 2011, Minecraft won awards in the categories for Best Debut Game, Best Downloadable Game and Innovation Award, winning every award for which it was nominated. It also won GameCity's video game arts award. On 5 May 2011, Minecraft was selected as one of the 80 games that would be displayed at the Smithsonian American Art Museum as part of The Art of Video Games exhibit that opened on 16 March 2012. At the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards, Minecraft won the award for Best Independent Game and was nominated in the Best PC Game category. In 2012, at the British Academy Video Games Awards, Minecraft was nominated in the GAME Award of 2011 category and Persson received The Special Award. In 2012, Minecraft XBLA was awarded a Golden Joystick Award in the Best Downloadable Game category, and a TIGA Games Industry Award in the Best Arcade Game category. In 2013, it was nominated as the family game of the year at the British Academy Video Games Awards. Minecraft Console Edition won the award for TIGA Game Of The Year in 2014. In 2015, the game placed 6th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list. In 2016, Minecraft placed 6th on Time's The 50 Best Video Games of All Time list.\nMinecraft was nominated for the 2013 Kids' Choice Awards for Favorite App, but lost to Temple Run. It was nominated for the 2014 Kids' Choice Awards for Favorite Video Game, but lost to Just Dance 2014. The game later won the award for the Most Addicting Game at the 2015 Kids' Choice Awards. In addition, the Java Edition was nominated for \"Favorite Video Game\" at the 2018 Kids' Choice Awards, while the game itself won the \"Still Playing\" award at the 2019 Golden Joystick Awards, as well as the \"Favorite Video Game\" award at the 2020 Kids' Choice Awards. Minecraft also won \"Stream Game of the Year\" at inaugural Streamer Awards in 2022.\n\nControversies\n2014 EULA changes\nMicrosoft and Mojang announced in 2014 that it would be changing the Minecraft End-user license agreement (EULA) to prohibit servers from accepting donations or payments in exchange for the donating or paying players receiving in-game advantages on such server, essentially banning servers from enacting \"pay-to-win\" (PTW) servers. Mojang spokesperson Owen Hill provided examples of what it would and would not allow, saying company would allow for pay-to-play servers in which a player is required to pay a fee to access the server, or for cosmetic enhancements (such as in-game costumes or pets), but that Mojang would be cracking down on paying to obtain powerful swords or potions. The new crackdowns were supported by Persson, citing him receiving multiple emails from parents of children who had spent hundreds of dollars on servers. The Minecraft community and server owners, however, heavily despised the new change in enforcement and protested en masse, which included comparing Mojang to monolithic video game publishers like Electronic Arts and Activision, gaming companies often criticized online for their highly restrictive digital rights management and user license agreements. Many argued that the crackdown would force smaller servers to close their doors, and some blamed the crackdown on Mojang attempting to suppress competition for its own Minecraft Realms subscription service.\n\nAccount migration\nIn 2020, Mojang Studios revealed that it would begin the process of requiring that Microsoft accounts be used in order to log into the Java Edition of the game, and that older Mojang Studios accounts would be sunsetted. The move to Microsoft accounts also required Java Edition players to create Xbox network Gamertags. Mojang Studios defended the move to Microsoft accounts by saying that improved security could be offered, which included Java accounts being able to use two factor authentication, players could block cyberbullies in chat, and improve parental controls. The community responded with intense backlash against this announcement, particularly taking issue to the various technical difficulties encountered in the process and how account migration would be mandatory, even for those who do not play on servers. As of March 10, 2022, Microsoft requires all players to migrate in order to access the Java Edition of Minecraft.\n\nJava Edition chat reporting\nIn June 2022, Microsoft and Mojang Studios announced it would be releasing a player reporting feature in all future builds of Java Edition. In earlier development builds, players could report other players on multiplayer servers for sending messages that are prohibited by the Xbox Live Code of Conduct; report categories included profane language, substance abuse, hate speech, threats of violence, and nudity, though Microsoft in later builds has since excluded the profane language category from the player reporting feature. If a player was found to be in violation of Xbox Community Standards, the player would be banned from all servers for a specific period of time or permanently. The update containing the report feature was released on 27 July 2022.\nMicrosoft and Mojang Studios received substantial backlash and protest from community members, one of the most common complaints being that banned players would be forbidden from joining any server, even private ones. Others took issue to what they saw as Microsoft increasing control over its player base and exercising censorship, sparking some to dub the version \"1.19.84\", in reference to the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\nCultural impact\nIn September 2019, The Guardian classified Minecraft as the best video game of (the first two decades of) the 21st century, and in November 2019\nPolygon called the game the \"most important game of the decade\" in its 2010s \"decade in review\". In December 2019, Forbes gave Minecraft a special mention in a list of the best video games of the 2010s, stating that the game is \"without a doubt one of the most important games of the last ten years.\" In June 2020, Minecraft was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame.\nMinecraft is recognized as one of the first successful games to use an early access model to draw in sales prior to its full release version to help fund development. As Minecraft helped to bolster indie game development in the early 2010s, it also helped to popularize the use of the early access model in indie game development.\n\nSocial media sites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Reddit played a significant role in popularizing Minecraft. Research conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communication showed that one-third of Minecraft players learned about the game via Internet videos. In 2010, Minecraft-related videos began to gain influence on YouTube, often made by commentators. The videos usually contain screen-capture footage of the game and voice-overs. Common coverage in the videos includes creations made by players, walkthroughs of various tasks, and parodies of works in popular culture. By May 2012, over four million Minecraft-related YouTube videos had been uploaded. The game would go on to be a prominent fixture within YouTube's gaming scene during the entire 2010s; in 2014, it was the second-most searched term on the entire platform. By 2018, it was still YouTube's biggest game globally.\nSome popular commentators have received employment at Machinima, a gaming video company that owns a highly watched entertainment channel on YouTube. The Yogscast is a British company that regularly produces Minecraft videos; their YouTube channel has attained billions of views, and their panel at Minecon 2011 had the highest attendance. Other well-known YouTube personalities include Jordan Maron, who has created many Minecraft parodies, including \"Minecraft Style\", a parody of the internationally successful single \"Gangnam Style\" by South Korean rapper Psy. Minecraft's popularity on YouTube was described by Polygon as quietly dominant, although in 2019, thanks in part to PewDiePie's playthrough of the game, Minecraft experienced a visible uptick in popularity on the platform. YouTube later announced that on December 14, 2021, the total amount of Minecraft-related views exceeded one trillion since the game's inception in 2009.\nMinecraft has been referenced by other video games, such as Torchlight II, Team Fortress 2, Borderlands 2, Choplifter HD, Super Meat Boy, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, The Binding of Isaac, The Stanley Parable, FTL: Faster Than Light, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the lattermost of which features a downloadable character and stage based on Minecraft. It was also referenced by electronic music artist deadmau5 in his performances. The game is also referenced heavily in \"Informative Murder Porn\", the second episode of the seventeenth season of the animated television series South Park. \"Luca$\", the seventeenth episode of the 25th season of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, and \"Minecraft is for Everyone\" by Starbomb was inspired by Minecraft.\n\nApplications\nThe possible applications of Minecraft have been discussed extensively, especially in the fields of computer-aided design and education. In a panel at Minecon 2011, a Swedish developer discussed the possibility of using the game to redesign public buildings and parks, stating that rendering using Minecraft was much more user-friendly for the community, making it easier to envision the functionality of new buildings and parks. In 2012, a member of the Human Dynamics group at the MIT Media Lab, Cody Sumter, said: \"Notch hasn't just built a game. He's tricked 40 million people into learning to use a CAD program.\" Various software has been developed to allow virtual designs to be printed using professional 3D printers or personal printers such as MakerBot and RepRap.\nIn September 2012, Mojang began the Block by Block project in cooperation with UN Habitat to create real-world environments in Minecraft. The project allows young people who live in those environments to participate in designing the changes they would like to see. Using Minecraft, the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the Minecraft servers and modify their own neighborhood. Carl Manneh, Mojang's managing director, called the game \"the perfect tool to facilitate this process\", adding \"The three-year partnership will support UN-Habitat's Sustainable Urban Development Network to upgrade 300 public spaces by 2016.\" Mojang signed Minecraft building community, FyreUK, to help render the environments into Minecraft. The first pilot project began in Kibera, one of Nairobi's informal settlements and is in the planning phase. The Block by Block project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, Mina Kvarter (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture. The ideas presented by the citizens were a template for political decisions.\n\nIn 2013, Stuart Duncan, known online as AutismFather, started a server for autistic children and their families, called Autcraft. The server was created because the public servers had many bullies and trolls that made the autistic kids angry and feel hurt. It was constantly monitored to help players and prevent bullying. The server had a whitelist that only allowed approved players, of which there are 8,000 players worldwide in 2017. The server had a unique ranking system based on the attributes of the player, offering titles such as \"Player of the Week\" and \"Caught Being Awesome\". The server was called \"one of the best places on the Internet\" and was a subject of a research paper.\nIn April 2014, the Danish Geodata Agency generated all of Denmark in fullscale in Minecraft based on their own geodata. This is possible because Denmark is one of the flattest countries with the highest point at 171 metres (561 ft) (ranking as the country with the 30th smallest elevation span), where the limit in default Minecraft is around 192 metres (630 ft) above in-game sea level.\nTaking advantage of the game's accessibility where other websites are censored, the non-governmental organization Reporters Without Borders have used an open Minecraft server to create the Uncensored Library, a repository within the game of journalism by authors from countries (including Egypt, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam) who have been censored and arrested, such as Jamal Khashoggi. The neoclassical virtual building was created over about 250 hours by an international team of 24 people.\nDespite its unpredictable nature, Minecraft has become a popular game for speedrunning, where players time themselves from being dropped into a new world to reaching The End and defeating the Ender Dragon boss. Some the speedrunners use a combination of mods, external programs, and debug menus, while other runners play the game in a more vanilla or more consistency-oriented way.\n\nEducation\nMinecraft has also been used in educational settings. In 2011, an educational organization named MinecraftEdu was formed with the goal of introducing Minecraft into schools. The group works with Mojang to make the game affordable and accessible to schools. The version of Minecraft through MinecraftEdu includes unique features to allow teachers to monitor the students' progress within the virtual world, such as receiving screenshots from students to show completion of a lesson. In September 2012, MinecraftEdu said that approximately 250,000 students around the world have access to Minecraft through the company. A wide variety of educational activities involving the game have been developed to teach students various subjects, including history, language arts and science. For an example, one teacher built a world consisting of various historical landmarks for students to learn and explore. Another teacher created a large-scale representation of an animal cell within Minecraft that student could explore and learn how the cell functions work. Great Ormond Street Hospital has been recreated in Minecraft, and it proposed that patients can use it to virtually explore the hospital before they actually visit. Minecraft may also prove as an innovation in Computer Aided Design (CAD). Minecraft offers an outlet of collaboration in design and could have an impact on the industry.\nWith the introduction of redstone blocks to represent electrical circuits, users have been able to build functional virtual computers within Minecraft. Such virtual creations include a working hard drive, an 8-bit virtual computer, and even a smaller-scale version of Minecraft that is playable and able to be built completely in survival mode with no external modifications. In at least one instance, a mod has been created to use this feature to teach younger players how to program within a language set by the virtual computer within a Minecraft world.\nAnother computational mechanic in Minecraft is the command block, a block that is only accessible in creative mode and can alter game logic. It has been used to create emulators for the Atari 2600 (including one by YouTube personality SethBling) and the Game Boy Advance.\nIn September 2014, the British Museum in London announced plans to recreate its building along with all exhibits in Minecraft in conjunction with members of the public.\nMicrosoft and non-profit Code.org had teamed up to offer Minecraft-based games, puzzles, and tutorials aimed to help teach children how to program; by March 2018, Microsoft and Code.org reported that more than 85 million children have used their tutorials.\n\nClones\nAfter the release of Minecraft, many video games were released with various similarities to Minecraft, and some were described as being \"clones\". Examples include Ace of Spades, CastleMiner, CraftWorld, FortressCraft, Terraria, BlockWorld 3D, Total Miner, and Minetest. David Frampton, designer of The Blockheads, reported that one failure of his 2D game was the \"low resolution pixel art\" that too closely resembled the art in Minecraft, which resulted in \"some resistance\" from fans. A homebrew adaptation of the alpha version of Minecraft for the Nintendo DS, titled DScraft, has been released; it has been noted for its similarity to the original game considering the technical limitations of the system.\nIn response to Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang and their Minecraft IP, various developers announced further clone titles developed specifically for Nintendo's consoles, as they were the only major platforms to not officially receive Minecraft at the time. These clone titles include UCraft (Nexis Games), Cube Life: Island Survival (Cypronia), Discovery (Noowanda), Battleminer (Wobbly Tooth Games), Cube Creator 3D (Big John Games), and Stone Shire (Finger Gun Games). Despite this, the fears of fans were unfounded, with official Minecraft releases on Nintendo consoles eventually resuming.\nMarkus Persson also   made another similar game, Minicraft, for a Ludum Dare competition in 2011.\n\nMinecon\nMinecon is the annual official fan convention dedicated to Minecraft. The first Minecon was held in November 2011 at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The event included the official launch of Minecraft; keynote speeches, including one by Persson; building and costume contests; Minecraft-themed breakout classes; exhibits by leading gaming and Minecraft-related companies; commemorative merchandise; and autograph and picture times with Mojang employees and well-known contributors from the Minecraft community. In 2016, Minecon was held in-person for the last time, with the following years featuring annual livestreams instead.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nGallagher, Colin (2014).

        "content": "Acrylic fibers are synthetic fibers made from a polymer (polyacrylonitrile) with an average molecular weight of ~100,000, about 1900 monomer units. For a fiber to be called \"acrylic\" in the US, the polymer must contain at least 85% acrylonitrile monomer. Typical comonomers are vinyl acetate or methyl acrylate. DuPont created the first acrylic fibers in 1941 and trademarked them under the name Orlon. It was first developed in the mid-1940s but was not produced in large quantities until the 1950s. Strong and warm, acrylic fiber is often used for sweaters and tracksuits and as linings for boots and gloves, as well as in furnishing fabrics and carpets. It is manufactured as a filament, then cut into short staple lengths similar to wool hairs, and spun into yarn.\nModacrylic is a modified acrylic fiber that contains at least 35% and at most 85% acrylonitrile. Vinylidene chloride or vinyl bromide used in modacrylic give the fiber flame retardant properties. End-uses of modacrylic include faux fur, wigs, hair extensions, and protective clothing.\n\nProduction\nThe polymer is formed by free-radical polymerization in aqueous suspension. The fiber is produced by dissolving the polymer in a solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or aqueous sodium thiocyanate, metering it through a multi-hole spinneret and coagulating the resultant filaments in an aqueous solution of the same solvent (wet spinning) or evaporating the solvent in a stream of heated inert gas (dry spinning). Washing, stretching, drying, and crimping complete the processing. Acrylic fibers are produced in a range of deniers, usually from 0.9 to 15, as cut staple or as a 500,000 to 1 million filaments tow. End uses include sweaters, hats, hand-knitting yarns, socks, rugs, awnings, boat covers, and upholstery; the fiber is also used as \"PAN\" precursor for carbon fiber. Production of acrylic fibers is centered in the Far East, Turkey, India, Mexico, and South America, though a number of European producers still continue to operate, including Dralon and Fisipe. US producers have ended production (except for specialty uses such as in friction materials, gaskets, specialty papers, conductive, and stucco), though acrylic tow and staple are still spun into yarns in the USA.  Former U.S. brands of acrylic included Acrilan (Monsanto), and Creslan (American Cyanamid). Other brand names that are still in use include Dralon (Dralon GmbH) and Drytex (Sudamericana de Fibras, S.A.).\nIn the late 1950s, Courtaulds Ltd began investigating the production of an acrylic fiber later to be called \"Courtelle\" by a process of solvent polymerization.  Methyl acrylate (6%) and acrylonitrile were polymerised in a 50% solution of sodium thiocyanate to produce a dope ready for spinning into a water bath to produce \"courtelle\" fiber in various grades of denier. The sodium thiocyanate solution was reconcentrated and re-used.  The reaction was a continuous process, with about 5% of reactants being recycled. This recycling process resulted in the build-up of pollutants in the process, as did the recycling of the solvent. A great deal of research in the chemical engineering laboratory in Lockhurst Lane, Coventry, and on the pre-production pilot plant at Little Heath overcame the recycling problems. It resulted in the process becoming a commercial success at a new production plant in Grimsby.\n\nTextile uses\nAcrylic is lightweight, soft, and warm, with a wool-like feel. It can also be made to mimic other fibers, such as cotton, when spun on short staple equipment. Some acrylic is extruded in colored or pigmented form; others is extruded in \"ecru\", otherwise known as \"natural,\" \"raw white,\" or \"undyed.\" Pigmented fiber has the highest color permanence. Its fibers are very resilient compared to both other synthetics and natural fibers. Some acrylic is used in clothing as a less expensive alternative to cashmere, due to the similar feeling of the materials. Some acrylic fabrics may fuzz or pill easily, though there are low-pilling variants.  Acrylic takes color well, is washable, and is generally hypoallergenic.  End-uses include socks, hats, gloves, scarves, sweaters, home furnishing fabrics, and awnings. Acrylic can also be used to make fake fur and to make many different knitted clothes.\nAs acrylic is a synthetic fiber, the larvae of clothes moths are unable to digest it. However, acrylic fibers that are blended with wool or soiled may be eaten as a consequence of having blended fibers.\nAcrylic is the \"workhorse\" hand-crafting fiber for crafters who knit or crochet; acrylic yarn may be perceived as \"cheap\" because it is typically priced lower than its natural-fiber counterparts, and because it lacks some of their properties, including softness and propensity to felt. The fiber requires heat to \"relax\" or set the shape of the finished garment, and it isn't as warm when wet as alternatives like wool. Some hand-knitters also complain that the fiber \"squeaks\" when knitted, or that it is painful to knit with because of a lack of \"give\" or stretch in the yarn. On the other hand, it is machine-washable and extremely color-fast. This makes it useful in certain items, like garments for babies, which require constant washing. However it is much more flammable than its natural fiber counterparts, so caution should be used when making items for babies and children.\n\nMicroplastic release\nA team at Plymouth University in the UK spent 12 months analyzing what happened when a number of synthetic materials were washed at different temperatures in domestic washing machines, using different combinations of detergents, to quantify the microfibres shed. They found that acrylic was responsible for releasing nearly 730,000 tiny synthetic particles (microplastics) per wash, five times more than polyester-cotton blend fabric, and nearly 1.5 times as many as pure polyester. Research by ecologist Mark Browne showed synthetic fibre waste over coastlines at a global scale, with the greatest concentration near sewage outflows. Of the man-made material found on the shoreline, 85% were microfibers and matched the types of material (such as nylon and acrylic) used in clothing.\n\nHistory\nIn the middle of the 20th century, the DuPont Company (USA) was actively developing a new material that could compete with the then-popular nylon in quality and properties. DuPont first introduced this material in 1948 to create a fabric that would be competitive with nylon in its properties. This research resulted in the emergence of Orlon, a synthetic fiber isolated from polymers. The material turned out to be incredibly practical and, by many characteristics, exceeded many artificial and natural analogs at that time. However, the new fabric had a significant disadvantage: the fibers could not be dyed. Only in 1952, four years later, DuPont chemists solved this problem. They created a new version of the previously invented synthetic fabric, which met all the requirements. And most importantly, it was perfectly dyed. A distinctive feature of the acrylic fiber is its burning behavior; it melts and emits acrid smoke with a sour smell. Although acrylic fabric has pros and cons, it is popular in the fashion and textile world due to its characteristics.\n\nSee also\nList of fabrics\n\n\n== References =="

        "last_edit_time": "19 November 2022, 11:00 (UTC)",
        "content": "Nador International Airport (Berber languages: Anafag en Ennaḍor Aɛarwi; Arabic: مطار الناظور العروي), (IATA: NDR, ICAO: GMMW), is an international airport serving Nador, a city in the Oriental region in Morocco. It is also known as Arwi Airport.\n\nLocation\nThe original location at Taouima moved to El Aroui, some 14 miles (24 km) south-southwest of Nador city. The airport lies nearly directly along the N2 national road. There is no public transport to the airport. Directly in front of the terminal there is a large (paid) parking-place which is mainly used for people bringing or picking up passengers.\nAlso outside the terminal there are many Grand Taxis offering shared connections with most major destinations for people flying to Nador. The taxis are also often offered for private-hire: thus where there is only one (group of) passenger(s).  Petit Taxis are available to come or go to the town of Al Aroui only.\n\nOverview\nAn initial airport was created in 1931 in the village of Tawima (south of Nador town) and was the primary airport for Melilla, since 1947 a Spanish enclave to the north. Following the independence of Morocco, Melilla began steps in creating an airport within Spanish control. In 1969 Melilla Airport opened to provide air travel between the Spanish enclave and mainland Spain.\nNador is a small international airport (Inaugurated in 1999) with links to Morocco's main airports and some European destinations such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain. In the summer season it becomes a very busy airport when many Moroccan nationals living in Western Europe and originating from the Rif region (Riffian people) travel through it. The Nador airport is owned and run by the state company ONDA. The main user is Royal Air Maroc but also low-cost carriers like Ryanair, Airarabia, Tuifly, Transavia fly to Nador.\nAlthough most flights are operated using the smaller Boeing 737 or similar, in the summer months the demand for seats is so high that Royal Air Maroc operated weekly flights from Amsterdam Schiphol and Brussels using their Boeing 747; however, in 2012, these flights were replaced by \"normal\" Boeing 737 flights. The runway and stand are designed to handle jumbos but the facilities like passport control get overwhelmed when a full B-747 arrives.\nFollowing the high number of travelers and flights, an extension Terminal work began in 2016. The old airport was demolished to rebuild the new airport which was inaugurated on July 9, 2021.\nIn 2009, the airport handled over 307,000 passengers.\n\nFacilities\nNador International Airport has a single terminal, divided into arrivals and departures, both on the ground floor. Check-in terminals are located at one side of the main terminal hall, while the other side is for baggage retrieval for arriving customers.\nThe airport has one runway, approximately 3,000 metres long and 45 metres wide. It can handle commercial aircraft up to a Boeing 747. Total aircraft parking space is 54,000 m2, enough for two Boeing 747s or four Boeing 737s. The airport has an ILS Class 1 certification and offers the following radionavigational aids: VOR – DME – NDB. PAPI lighting is available when landing on Runway 28.\n\nAirlines and destinations\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Nador Airport:\n\n^a  This flight operates between Tangier and Amsterdam via Nador. However, this carrier does not sell tickets solely between Nador and Tangier. \n^b  This flight operates between Tangier and Brussels via Nador. However, this carrier does not sell tickets solely between Nador and Tangier.\n\nGround transport\nThe airport is located at Al Arouit and approximately 25 km. from Nador city by road. Other than taxis, no public transport is available. On arrival, meeting incoming flights many grand taxis and petit taxis wait outside the terminal and offer transfers to most regional cities. A paid car-park area is directly outside the terminal, mainly used to bring passengers or pick up arriving passengers. The roads between the airport and Nador city are in good condition and signposted in Arabic and French.\nThe airport lies directly along the main national route N2 (from Tangier to Oujda). From the airport the route to the city uses this N2 in an easterly direction to the north outdoor route N15 to the city.\n\nSince June 23, 2023, a new bus line serves the International airport of Al Aroui to the city of Nador every hour from 08:00 am to 10:00 pm\nAIRBUS Line Number: 23 (near the Terminal arrivals terminal)\n\nTraffic statistics\nLike other Moroccan airports, the traffic is very seasonal. All through the year, Royal Air Maroc (in codeshare with Atlas Blue) flies several times per week to Brussels and Amsterdam, but in the summer season more flights are scheduled. In the peak season, RAM even uses their Boeing 747 jumbojet every week on the route to/from Amsterdam and Brussels instead of the smaller Boeing 737 as they do the rest of the year.\n\nNearly a third of the annual traffic is handled by the airport during the summer months. Because Nador and surroundings aren't (yet) a tourist destination such as Agadir or Marrakesh, nearly all passengers are Moroccan nationals (incl. 2nd and 3rd generation) visiting relatives.\nRecent statistics\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Nador - El Aroui Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nCurrent weather for GMMW at NOAA/NWS\nAccident history for NDR at Aviation Safety Network"

        "content": "Steve Austin (born Steven James Anderson; December 18, 1964), better known by his ring name \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, is an American media personality, actor, producer and retired professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE, as an ambassador. Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, he was integral to the development and success of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as WWE) during the Attitude Era, an industry boom period in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nAustin began his professional wrestling career in 1989, after playing college football at the University of North Texas. He signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1991 and adopted the persona of \"Stunning\" Steve Austin, a villainous in-ring technician, and he won the WCW World Television Championship and the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship twice each, alongside one reign with a double crown of the WCW World Tag Team Championship and NWA World Tag Team Championship, with Brian Pillman (as the Hollywood Blondes). After a brief stint in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), Austin signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1995.\nIn the WWF, Austin was repackaged as a short-tempered, brash and brazen anti-establishment antihero named \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, becoming the most popular wrestler of the Attitude Era off the back of his feud with company chairman Mr. McMahon. He won the WWF Championship six times, the WWF Intercontinental Championship twice, the Million Dollar Championship once, and the WWF Tag Team Championship four times, making him the fifth WWF Triple Crown Champion. He is also a record three-time Royal Rumble winner, won the 1996 King of the Ring, and headlined multiple WWF pay-per-view events, including its flagship event WrestleMania four times (14, 15, 17 and 38). He was forced to retire from in-ring competition in 2003 after multiple knee injuries and a serious neck injury at the 1997 SummerSlam event, making sporadic appearances ever since. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009, and returned for a one-off match against Kevin Owens at WrestleMania 38 in April 2022.\nAustin hosts the podcast The Steve Austin Show (2013–present), and the video podcast Broken Skull Sessions (2019–present) available on the WWE Network and Peacock. He collaborates with El Segundo Brewing on Broken Skull IPA and Broken Skull American Lager. He also hosted the reality competition series Steve Austin's Broken Skull Challenge (2014–2017) and Straight Up Steve Austin (2019–2021).\n\nEarly life\nAustin was born Steven James Anderson in Austin, Texas, on December 18, 1964. His parents, Beverly (née Harrison) and James Anderson, divorced when he was around a year old. His mother moved to Edna, Texas, where Austin would spend most of his childhood, and she married Ken Williams in 1968. Austin adopted his stepfather's surname and legally changed his name to Steven James Williams, after he was legally adopted, though he would legally change it again to Steve Austin later in life. He has a younger sister named Jennifer and three brothers named Scott, Kevin, and Jeff. Kevin is less than a year younger than Austin, leading Austin to theorize in his autobiography that their father may have left because he could not handle another child so soon. After finishing his education at Edna High School, he got a football scholarship to Wharton County Junior College followed by a full scholarship to the University of North Texas. He played originally as a linebacker before suffering a knee injury, prompting him to switch to play as a defensive end.\nThe first wrestling events Austin watched were those produced by Houston Wrestling and run by Paul Boesch, and Austin would later say, \"I fell in love with the business when I was seven or eight years old. All I ever wanted to be was a professional wrestler. Wrestling was the biggest thing in my life.\" When he moved to attend university, he was living approximately 30 miles from the Dallas Sportatorium, a building he later described fondly as a \"magnificent shithole of a building\". It was here that World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) ran shows on a Friday night.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\nEarly career (1989–1991)\nDeciding to become a wrestler, Austin joined \"Gentleman\" Chris Adams' school in the Dallas Sportatorium, where Adams also wrestled for WCCW. The first seminar cost Austin $45 (equivalent to $111 in 2023). Adams' training was purely technical, teaching Austin the moves, but nothing relating to kayfabe. Austin would later describe Adams as a \"conman\" who \"didn't try to smarten [him] up or teach [him] the real deal when it came to wrestling\". His first lesson in that came from Tony Falk, the referee in his 1989 televised WCCW debut against Frogman LeBlanc, who called the spots to lead him to a pinfall and a $40 (equivalent to $98 in 2023) payday. Early influences on his career were the Von Erich family, Dusty Rhodes, and Ric Flair.\nInitially working under his real name, he was renamed Steve Austin by Memphis booker Dutch Mantell during the merger of WCCW and the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) into the United States Wrestling Association (USWA). The name change occurred to avoid confusion with \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams, a well-known wrestler during that time. Austin later returned to Dallas, managed by Percy Pringle and accompanied by Jeannie Adams (Adams's ex-girlfriend and Austin's girlfriend at the time) and feuded with Adams and his wife Toni.\n\nWorld Championship Wrestling (1991–1995)\nDangerous Alliance (1991–1992)\nAustin debuted in World Championship Wrestling in May 1991. He was nicknamed \"Stunning\" Steve Austin, a name and gimmick he later said he could not commit to. Austin was originally paired with a valet named Vivacious Veronica but was later joined by Jeannie Adams, known as \"Lady Blossom\". Just weeks after his debut, Austin defeated Bobby Eaton for his first WCW World Television Championship on June 3, 1991, and later that year joined Paul E. Dangerously's Dangerous Alliance. Austin lost the WCW World Television Championship to Barry Windham in a two-out-of-three-falls match on April 27, 1992, but regained the championship from Windham the following month. He enjoyed a second lengthy reign as champion, before losing the championship to Ricky Steamboat at Clash of the Champions XX in September 1992, while the Dangerous Alliance disbanded shortly thereafter. \nIn August and September 1992, as part of a working agreement between WCW and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Austin wrestled four matches in Japan. He took part in the 1992 G1 Climax, defeating Arn Anderson in the first round before losing to Keiji Muto in the second round. He and Arn Anderson then defeated Raging Staff (Super Strong Machine and Tatsutoshi Goto) in a tag team bout held in the Ryōgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo. In his final bout, Austin challenged Masahiro Chono for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of the \"Battle Hold Arena\" event at the Yokohama Arena in Yokohama, losing by submission after Chono applied an STF.\n\nHollywood Blonds; Stud Stable (1992–1993)\nIn September 1992, Austin formed a tag team known as the Hollywood Blonds with Brian Pillman, at the behest of lead booker Dusty Rhodes. Austin would later say that he was not excited about being placed into a tag team, as he was earmarked for a run with the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship with Harley Race as his manager. Initially billed under their individual personas, Pillman decided the pair needed their own finishing move, ring gear and team name, with traveling partner Scott Levy proposing The Hollywood Blonds, used in the 1970s by Buddy Roberts and Jerry Brown. The pair adopted an \"old-style movie camera hand gesture\", and informed opponents they had experienced a \"brush with greatness\". At Halloween Havoc in October 1992, Austin (substituting for Terry Gordy) teamed with \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams to wrestle Dustin Rhodes and Windham for the unified WCW and NWA World Tag Team Championship, wrestling to a 30-minute time limit draw.\nOn March 27, 1993, the Hollywood Blonds won the unified NWA and WCW World Tag Team Championship by defeating Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas, and held the championship for five months. In the main event of Clash of the Champions XXIII in June 1993, the Blondes defended their championship against Ric Flair and Arn Anderson in a two-out-of-three-falls, where despite losing the first two falls, retained the championship as the second fall had been determined by a disqualification caused by Barry Windham. At Clash of the Champions XXIV In August 1993, Austin and Pillman were scheduled to defend their championship against Anderson and Paul Roma but a legitimately injured Pillman was replaced by Steven Regal, with whom Austin lost to Anderson and Roma.\nWith Pillman injured, Austin joined Colonel Robert Parker's Stud Stable. After Pillman returned, the team was broken up when Austin turned on him, a decision Austin describes as a \"mystery\". Austin defeated Pillman in a singles match at Clash of the Champions XXV in November 1993.\n\nUnited States Champion; departure (1993–1995)\nAt Starrcade in December 1993, Austin defeated Dustin Rhodes 2–0 in a two-out-of-three-falls match to win the WCW United States Championship. At Clash of the Champions XXVIII in August 1994, Austin lost the Championship to Ricky Steamboat. He was scheduled to face Steamboat in a rematch at Fall Brawl '94: War Games in September 1994; however, Steamboat was unable to wrestle due to a legitimate back injury and Austin was awarded the championship by forfeit. His second reign with the championship ended just five minutes later when he lost to Steamboat's replacement, Jim Duggan, in a match that lasted 35 seconds. Austin unsuccessfully challenged Duggan for the championship at both Halloween Havoc in October 1994 and Clash of the Champions XXIX in November 1994. The influence of Hulk Hogan and the Hulkamania era was beginning to take hold in WCW, with vice president Eric Bischoff saying this was likely the reason Austin lost to Duggan, who had been a popular figure during that period of time. Around this time, Austin pitched a storyline idea to Bischoff in which it would be revealed that Austin was a family member of Hogan. The proposal was quickly turned down on account of Bischoff's belief that Hogan would not work with somebody such as Austin, who was not a proven name.\nFollowing Clash of the Champions XXIX, Austin was inactive while rehabilitating a knee injury, returning in February 1995. In April 1995, Austin took part in a tournament for the vacant United States Championship, defeating Jim Duggan via countout in the first round but losing to Randy Savage in the quarter-final. He wrestled what would be his final match with WCW on May 21, 1995, defeating Eddie Jackie in a bout that aired on WCW Main Event. In late May and June 1995, Austin again appeared with New Japan Pro-Wrestling as part of its \"Fighting Spirit Legend\" series, primarily teaming with Arn Anderson and Ron Simmons. At the \"Super Power Group Declaration VI\" event in the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, Austin, Anderson, and Mike Enos lost to J-J-Jacks (Akira Nogami and Takayuki Iizuka) and Junji Hirata in a six-man tag team match.\nDuring the NJPW tour, Austin suffered a torn triceps. While rehabilitating, Austin was fired by WCW President Eric Bischoff on September 15, 1995. Bischoff did not see Austin as a marketable wrestler, and additionally thought Austin was hard to work with.\n\nExtreme Championship Wrestling (1995)\nAustin was contacted by Paul Heyman of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), who had previously managed him in WCW. Heyman hired him to do promos and in-ring interviews as he had not adequately recovered from his injury, paying Austin $500 (equivalent to $1,000 in 2023) a night. Changing his nickname to \"Superstar\", Austin debuted in ECW at Gangstas Paradise on September 18, 1995.\nWhile in ECW, Austin used the platform to develop his future \"Stone Cold\" persona as well as a series of vignettes running down WCW in general and Bischoff in particular, most memorably in several promos that mocked his then-status as Nitro host by introducing Monday NyQuil, where he was joined by \"Bongo\" (a set of drums, meant to represent Steve \"Mongo\" McMichael) in promoting the show \"where the big boys play with each other.\" Several wrestlers have credited ECW as the place where Austin developed his microphone skills. Austin has credited Heyman as the man who taught him how to cut a promo.\nWhipwreck, who was the ECW World Heavyweight Champion at the time, defeated Austin in an upset to retain the championship at November to Remember. The Sandman defeated Austin and Whipwreck in a triple threat match at December to Dismember for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE\nThe Ringmaster and birth of \"Stone Cold\" (1995–1996)\nAustin joined the WWF at the end of 1995 after Diesel and Jim Ross helped convince WWF's owner Vince McMahon to hire him. He debuted in WWF on December 18, 1995, which was broadcast on the January 8, 1996, episode of Raw. His debut saw him awarded the Million Dollar Championship by his manager, Ted DiBiase. Wrestling in his debut match on Raw he defeated Matt Hardy using the moniker \"The Ringmaster\". While making his first pay-per-view (PPV) appearance at the Royal Rumble, he was scripted to be among the final four wrestlers in the ring, which could have given him an early push; however, The Ringmaster failed to hang onto the ropes after Fatu clotheslined him over and slipped out of the ring early.\nAustin soon thought the Ringmaster gimmick was weak and asked for a change. Having battled thinning hair for a few years, he decided to shave his head in early 1996. He later said in a 2017 interview, \"After watching the Pulp Fiction movie with Bruce Willis, that's the haircut that inspired me. I was traveling on the road to Pittsburgh with Dustin Rhodes and before I went to the show, I said fuck it. I went into the bathroom with a razor blade and shaved all my hair off. Then I grew the goatee and everything came full circle.\" By March 11, The Ringmaster moniker (now merely a prefix to his ring name) would be discarded in favor of his most famous ring name, \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin in a match against Savio Vega. The new name was prompted by his English wife at the time, Jeanie, who told him to drink a cup of tea she had made for him before it became \"stone cold\". His new persona was partially inspired by serial killer \"The Iceman\" Richard Kuklinski.\nAustin wrestled Vega on Raw to a double countout, before defeating him in his first WrestleMania appearance at WrestleMania XII. At In Your House: Good Friends, Better Enemies, Austin lost to Vega in a rematch. At In Your House: Beware of Dog, Austin lost a Caribbean strap match to Vega, with the added stipulation that DiBiase was forced to leave the WWF as a result, leading Austin to quietly vacate the Million Dollar title. DiBiase would later say that nobody foresaw the success Austin would have, and had advised him to ignore the advice given to him by producers and continue what he was doing as success required patience.\n\nAustin 3:16 and rise to superstardom (1996–1997)\nAustin's rise to stardom began at the 1996 King of the Ring, where he won the tournament by defeating Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts. At the time, Roberts was portraying a born-again Christian, which inspired Austin to ad-lib a famous promo during his coronation, mocking Roberts' religious faith and proclaiming the now-iconic catchphrase \"Austin 3:16\" as derision of the Bible verse John 3:16. At the conclusion of this same promo, he further ad-libbed the line, \"And that’s the bottom line, cuz Stone Cold said so.\" This, too, went on to become an iconic catchphrase, as Austin would conclude almost all of his future promos with it. Years later, Austin would say of this moment, \"It’s like I got two at-bats and hit two grand slams.\"\nAustin's win and rise to stardom proved to be an unexpected stroke of luck. Hunter Hearst Helmsley was originally scheduled to win the tournament, but plans changed as he was punished for taking part in the Curtain Call incident. \"Austin 3:16\" ultimately became one of the most popular catchphrases in wrestling history, and one of the best-selling T-shirts in WWE merchandise history.\n\nAfter defeating Yokozuna at SummerSlam, throughout August and September Austin spoke about Bret Hart, challenging him constantly and taunting him relentlessly, before Hart finally returned on Raw to challenge Austin to a match at Survivor Series, which he accepted. During an episode of Superstars, old friend Brian Pillman conducted an interview with Austin regarding his upcoming match. After Pillman inadvertently complimented Hart, Austin grew angry and attacked him. He then proceeded to wedge Pillman's ankle in between a steel chair and stomp on it, breaking his ankle in storyline. It would lead to the infamous \"Pillman's got a gun\" segment on Raw wherein Austin broke into Pillman's home while he was nursing his injury. Pillman had been anticipating him and was armed with a pistol. Just as Austin broke in, Pillman aimed his gun at him before the episode cut to commercial break. The segment was highly controversial for its perceived violence and rare use of profanity in WWF programming. The segment is also credited for paving the way for WWF's shift to more mature programming. At Survivor Series, in a match to determine the number-one contender for the WWF Championship, Hart defeated Austin by using a turnbuckle to push himself backward while locked in the Million Dollar Dream.\nDuring the 1997 Royal Rumble match, Austin was originally eliminated by Hart but the officials did not see it; he snuck back into the ring and eliminated Hart by throwing him over the ropes, winning the match. This led to the first-ever PPV main event of Austin's WWF career at In Your House 13: Final Four, where he competed in a four corners elimination match against Hart, The Undertaker, and Vader for the vacant WWF Championship. Austin was eliminated early from the match after injuring his knee; Hart would win the match and the championship. Hart lost the championship the next night on Raw to Sycho Sid due to Austin's interference, continuing their feud. At WrestleMania 13, Hart defeated Austin in a highly acclaimed submission match with Ken Shamrock as a special referee. During the match, Austin had been cut, and was bleeding profusely from his face, but he refused to tap out when Hart locked in his Sharpshooter, and finally passed out from excessive blood loss, losing the match. After the match, Hart continued to hold the Sharpshooter on Austin, who, despite his wounds, refused any assistance back to the locker room, thus turning Hart heel and Austin babyface in a rare double-turn. Austin portrayed an anti-hero instead of a traditional babyface, and he didn't embrace the fans at first either. Austin eventually got his revenge on Hart in the main event of In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker, defeating him in a match to determine the next contender to The Undertaker's WWF Championship. Austin won when Hart was disqualified due to assistance from The British Bulldog. Austin faced Hart once again in a street fight on April 21 episode of Raw, injuring his opponent's leg with a steel chair during the bout. The match was ruled a no contest, but Austin proceeded to beat Hart while he was on a stretcher in the back of an ambulance. At In Your House 15: A Cold Day in Hell, Austin had The Undertaker down with the Stone Cold Stunner but was distracted by Pillman, allowing The Undertaker to recover and perform a Tombstone Piledriver for the victory.\nOn Raw, Austin partnered with the returning Shawn Michaels, as they both had a mutual enemy in the Harts. They defeated Owen Hart and The British Bulldog for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Despite being champions, the two constantly argued and ultimately faced each other in a match at King of the Ring, which ended in a double disqualification after both men attacked the referee. Michaels was later forced to vacate his championship due to an injury. Hart and Bulldog won a tournament to face Austin and a partner of his choice, but he refused to pick a partner and decided to face the duo by himself. Late in the match, a debuting Dude Love came out to offer assistance. Austin accepted and the duo won the match and the titles, making Austin a two-time tag team champion. Austin continued his feud with the Hart family, becoming embroiled in a heated rivalry particularly with Owen, who pinned a distracted Austin and secured victory for The Hart Foundation in the ten-man Tag Team match main event of In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede, where Austin was partnered with Ken Shamrock, Goldust, and The Legion of Doom.\nAt SummerSlam, Austin and Owen faced each other with the Intercontinental Championship on the line, with Owen adding a stipulation that Austin would have to kiss his buttocks if he lost. During the match, Owen botched a Tombstone Piledriver and dropped Austin on his head, resulting in a legitimate bruised spinal cord and temporary paralysis for Austin. As Owen stalled by baiting the audience, Austin managed to crawl over and pin Hart using a roll-up to win the championship. A visibly injured and dazed Austin was helped to his feet by several referees and led to the back. Due to the severity of his neck injury, Austin was forced to relinquish both championships. On September 22, on the first-ever Raw to be broadcast from Madison Square Garden, McMahon told Austin he wasn't physically cleared to compete, and after several weeks of build-up, Austin delivered his Stone Cold Stunner to McMahon, causing the fans in attendance to go ballistic. Austin was then arrested as part of the storyline, and was sidelined until Survivor Series. However, in the interim, he made several appearances, one being at Badd Blood where he was involved in the finish of a match between Owen and Faarooq for the vacant Intercontinental Championship. Austin hit Faarooq with the Intercontinental Championship belt while the referee's back was turned, causing Hart to win the match and the title. Austin's motive was to keep Owen as champion, as demonstrated when he interfered in Hart's matches on Raw. Austin regained the Intercontinental Championship from Hart at Survivor Series.\nWith Hart out of the way, Austin set his sights on The Rock, who stole Austin's championship belt after Austin suffered a beating by his Nation of Domination stablemates. In the weeks to come, The Rock began declaring himself to be \"the best damn Intercontinental Champion ever.\" The Rock kept possession of the championship belt until D-Generation X: In Your House, when Austin defeated him to retain the championship and regain the belt. As Austin had used his pickup truck to aid his victory, McMahon ordered him to defend the championship against The Rock the next night on Raw. In an act of defiance, Austin forfeited the championship to The Rock before tossing the belt into the Piscataqua River.\n\nFeud with Vince McMahon (1998–1999)\nAfter Bret Hart's controversial departure for WCW, Austin and Michaels were the top stars in the company. Austin won the 1998 Royal Rumble, lastly eliminating The Rock. The next night on Raw, Austin interrupted Vince McMahon in his presentation of Mike Tyson, who was making a special appearance, over the objection of McMahon referring to Tyson as \"the baddest man on the planet.\" Austin insulted Tyson by flipping him off, which led to Tyson shoving Austin much to McMahon's embarrassment, who began publicly to disapprove of the prospect of Austin as his champion. Tyson was later announced as \"the special enforcer\" for the main event at WrestleMania XIV, and aligned himself with Michaels's stable D-Generation X (DX). This led to Austin's WWF Championship match against Michaels at WrestleMania XIV, which he won with help from Tyson, who turned on DX by making the deciding three-count against Michaels and later hit him with his knock-out punch. This was Michaels's last match until 2002 as he had suffered two legitimate herniated discs and another completely crushed at the hands of The Undertaker in a casket match at the Royal Rumble. With Michaels's absence and Austin winning the WWF Championship, the \"Austin Era\" was ushered in.\n\nOn Raw the following night, McMahon presented him with a new championship belt and warned Austin that he did not approve of his rebellious nature, desiring a \"corporate champion\"; Austin responded with a Stone Cold Stunner, leading him being kayfabe arrested once again. The following week, it appeared as if Austin had agreed with McMahon, appearing in a suit and tie, before revealing it was a ruse and again attacking McMahon. On April 13, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no-contest when Dude Love made an appearance. This led to a match between Dude Love and Austin at Unforgiven: In Your House, where Austin hit McMahon with a steel chair and went on to retain the title. The following month, Austin and Dude had a rematch at Over the Edge: In Your House for the WWF Championship. Austin managed to retain the championship despite McMahon acting as the self-appointed referee and his \"Corporate Stooges\" (Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson) as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. McMahon continued to do everything he could to dethrone Austin as champion and he finally scored a big victory for his side at King of the Ring. Austin lost the WWF Championship to Kane in a First Blood match after The Undertaker accidentally hit him with a steel chair while the ref was incapacitated, despite Austin having knocked Kane unconscious and thwarted an earlier intervention by Mankind.\nAustin further angered McMahon by winning back the championship the next night on Raw. Austin also emerged victorious against The Undertaker at SummerSlam. In response, McMahon set up a Triple Threat match at Breakdown: In Your House, where The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin at the same time. McMahon decided to vacate the WWF Championship and award it based on a match between The Undertaker and Kane, in which Austin was the guest referee on Judgment Day: In Your House. Austin refused to count for either man and attacked both towards the end of the match. McMahon would, in storyline, fire him as a result, although Austin got revenge by kidnapping McMahon and dragging him to the middle of the ring at \"gunpoint\", which ended up being a toy gun with a scroll that read \"Bang! 3:16.\" During that segment, McMahon also learned that Austin was later re-signed by his son, Shane McMahon. In the semifinals of the Survivor Series tournament to crown a new WWF Champion, Austin lost to Mankind after Shane double-crossed Austin. The next night on Raw, Judge Mills Lane ruled that The Rock had to defend his newly won WWF Championship against Austin that night, as stipulated in the new contract Austin had signed two weeks earlier with Shane. The Undertaker interfered and hit Austin with a shovel, earning Austin a disqualification victory, meaning The Rock remained champion. At Rock Bottom: In Your House, Austin defeated The Undertaker in a Buried Alive match after Kane performed a Tombstone Piledriver on The Undertaker which sent him into the grave. With this victory, Austin qualified for the 1999 Royal Rumble. Austin's next appearance after this would be the January 4, 1999, edition of Raw, where he would come out to help Mankind defeat The Rock to become the WWF Champion by striking The Rock in the face with a steel chair and draping Mankind's body over him.\n\nAustin's next chance to exact revenge on Mr. McMahon came during the Royal Rumble match. On Raw, McMahon drew Austin's entry number with the intention of screwing him over. Austin drew entry number one, while McMahon drew number two thanks to Commissioner Shawn Michaels. During the Royal Rumble match, Austin followed McMahon out of the ring and into the backstage area, only to be ambushed by members of The Corporation, and an injured Austin was taken to the hospital. Austin, however, returned in an ambulance and re-entered the match, delivering a Stone Cold Stunner to Big Boss Man and eliminating him. With the match down to Austin and McMahon, The Rock came down to the ring to distract Austin, who was eliminated by McMahon, thus McMahon winning the Royal Rumble.\nMcMahon turned down the number-one contender spot, and Michaels promptly awarded Austin the championship shot the next night on Raw. At St. Valentine's Day Massacre, Austin faced McMahon in a steel cage match, with the championship opportunity at WrestleMania XV at stake. During the match, Paul Wight made his WWF debut, coming from under the ring and attacking Austin, but Wight's attack propelled Austin into the side of the cage forcing the cage to give way and dropping Austin to the floor first, making him the victor. The week before WrestleMania, Austin interrupted The Rock, Vince, and Shane McMahon's interview segment by driving a beer truck to the ring and using a hose to spray the trio with beer. Austin defeated The Rock at WrestleMania XV to win his third WWF Championship. Austin faced The Rock in a rematch the following month at Backlash, in which Shane was the referee. During the match, Vince approached the ring, only to hand Austin back his Smoking Skull championship belt and take Shane out of the proceedings. Austin won the match when another referee made the count. Austin would lose the championship to The Undertaker at Over the Edge. Due to events revolving around Vince, Stephanie and Linda McMahon made Austin the chief executive officer (CEO) of the company as part of the storyline. Vince and Shane challenged Austin to a handicap ladder match at King of the Ring with the title of CEO on the line, which the McMahons won. The next night on Raw, Austin challenged and defeated The Undertaker to win his fourth WWF Championship. The two would compete in a \"First Blood\" match at Fully Loaded, with the stipulation that if Austin lost he would never compete for the WWF Championship again, but if Austin won, Vince would depart the company; Austin won after interference from X-Pac.\n\nChampionship reigns and The Alliance (1999–2001)\nAustin held on to the WWF Championship until SummerSlam on August 22 when he lost it to Mankind in a triple threat match also featuring Triple H. in the two months that followed, Triple H would gain possession of the title. Austin would get his rematch at No Mercy on October 17 against Triple H, but Austin lost after The Rock accidentally struck him with a sledgehammer shot meant for Triple H. The three were advertised for a triple-threat match at Survivor Series on November 14, where Austin was run down by a car. The segment was to write him off television, with the neck injury suffered two years prior posing a real threat of early retirement, and was advised to undergo surgery. Austin would later describe this as \"the worst storyline I was ever involved in\".\nAustin made a one-off appearance at Backlash on April 30, 2000, attacking Triple H and Vince McMahon to help The Rock reclaim the WWF Championship. After Austin's official return at Unforgiven on September 24, Commissioner Mick Foley led an investigation to find out who ran Austin over, with the culprit revealed to be Rikishi. At No Mercy on October 22, Austin faced Rikishi in a No Holds Barred match, during which Austin attempted to run Rikishi down in a truck, but was prevented from doing so by officials, and the match was deemed a no contest; Austin was subsequently arrested. During a handicap match against Rikishi and Kurt Angle, Triple H came down with the apparent intention of teaming with Austin, only to hit Austin with a sledgehammer and reveal he had instructed Rikishi to run him over. At Survivor Series on November 19, Triple H aimed to run Austin down again during their match but his plot failed when Austin lifted Triple H's car with a forklift, then let it drop 20 feet. Austin won his third Royal Rumble match on January 21, 2001, last eliminating Kane. His rivalry against Triple H ended at No Way Out on February 25 in a Three Stages of Hell match, with Triple H defeating Austin two falls to one.\nWith The Rock defeating Angle for the WWF Championship at No Way Out, Austin was again set to face him at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1. In the weeks leading up to WrestleMania, animosity grew between Austin and The Rock, stemming from Austin's wife, Debra, being assigned to be The Rock's manager by Mr. McMahon. The match at WrestleMania was made a no disqualification match. During the match, McMahon came to the ring, preventing The Rock from pinning Austin on two separate occasions and giving Austin a steel chair. Austin then hit The Rock several times with the chair before pinning him to win the WWF Championship for the fifth time. After the match, Austin shook hands with McMahon, turning heel for the first time since 1997. During a steel cage match with The Rock in a rematch for the WWF Championship the following night on Raw is War, Triple H came down to the ring with a sledgehammer. After teasing siding with The Rock, Triple H instead aligned himself with Austin and McMahon, attacking The Rock and put him out of action. Austin further cemented his heel turn the following Thursday on SmackDown!, when, during an interview with Jim Ross about his actions at WrestleMania, he thought Ross was denouncing their friendship and then assaulted Ross. Austin and Triple H became a team known as The Two-Man Power Trip. Austin altered his character considerably over the next few months by becoming a whiny, temperamental prima donna who complained incessantly when he felt he was not getting respect. He also developed a strange infatuation with McMahon, going to great lengths to impress him, even going so far as to hug him and bring him presents.\nAustin and Triple H ran roughshod over all their opponents, until coming up against The Undertaker and Kane. After defeating them for the WWF Tag Team Championship at Backlash on April 29, they held the tag team titles, the WWF Championship (Austin) and the Intercontinental Championship (Triple H) all at once. On the May 21 episode of Raw is War, Austin and Triple H defended their tag team championship against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit; during the match, Triple H tore his quadriceps, and the team lost the match and the tag team championship in a highly acclaimed bout, with Jim Ross saying the quartet created \"magic\", while wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer awarded the match four-and-a-three-quarter stars out of a possible five in his Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Austin officially broke up The Power Trip on that week's SmackDown!, criticizing Triple H for his injury and for hitting him with the sledgehammer. He continued to align himself with McMahon and began feuding with Jericho and Benoit by himself, leading to a triple-threat match at King of the Ring on June 24; despite interference from the debuting Booker T, Austin retained the championship.\n\nMeanwhile, the purchase of WCW by Vince McMahon began to bear fruit as The Invasion began. Invading WCW wrestlers formed an alliance with a group of ECW wrestlers, with the group led by Shane and Stephanie McMahon. Vince called Austin out and demanded that he bring \"the old Stone Cold\" back so he could effectively captain a team of WWF wrestlers in a ten-man tag team match at Invasion on July 22. Austin initially refused, but on the following episode of Raw is War, he returned to his old ways and hit Stunners on every member of the Alliance, turning face once again. At Invasion, Austin captained the WWF team consisting of himself, Angle, Jericho, and The Undertaker and Kane against the team of WCW's Booker T and Diamond Dallas Page and ECW's Rhyno and The Dudley Boyz. Austin turned heel once again by hitting a Stunner on Angle and helping Team WCW/ECW win the match. Austin subsequently joined the Alliance as their leader.\nAustin lost the WWF Championship to Angle at Unforgiven on September 23 by submitting to the ankle lock, ending Austin's reign at 175 days, the longest reign since 1996. He would regain the title on the October 8 episode of Raw, when WWF Commissioner William Regal betrayed Angle and joined the Alliance. Austin then began feuding with Alliance member Rob Van Dam, who was the only member of the Alliance to be cheered by the fans, despite the villainous tactics of the group. Austin faced Angle and Van Dam at No Mercy on October 21 and retained the title by pinning Van Dam. For Survivor Series on November 18, a \"winner takes all\" 10-man tag team match was announced; Austin captained a team consisting Angle, Shane McMahon, Van Dam, and Booker T, against Team WWF; captained by The Rock, the team also included Jericho, Kane, The Undertaker and Big Show. At Survivor Series, Angle sided with the WWF, helping The Rock to hit the Rock Bottom and pin Austin to win the match, marking the end of the Invasion storyline.\nThe following night on Raw, Vince McMahon decided he was going to strip Austin of the championship and award it to Angle, before Ric Flair returned and announced he was now co-owner of the WWF. Austin returned moments after this announcement and attacked Angle and McMahon for their actions. He was then handed his championship belt by Flair and celebrated with him in the ring, turning him face once again. At Vengeance on December 9, a tournament was held to unify the WWF Championship and the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, held by The Rock; also involving Angle and Jericho. Austin would defeat Angle, before losing the unification match to Jericho following interference by McMahon and Booker T.\n\nFinal feuds and retirement (2002–2003)\nIn the 2002 Royal Rumble on January 20, Austin entered at number nineteen and lasted until the final four, but was eliminated by Kurt Angle. On the January 28 episode of Raw, he defeated Angle to earn a shot at Chris Jericho's Undisputed WWF Championship at No Way Out. In the build-up to No Way Out, McMahon had signed the New World Order (nWo), who immediately began a feud with Austin. The nWo would make their debut at No Way Out. During the show, Austin refused a beer gift from the nWo, and they cost him his match against Jericho later that night. Problems were beginning to surface backstage, however, as Austin was unhappy regarding Hulk Hogan's return to the WWF. He was reported as refusing to lose to Hogan in a proposed match between the two at WrestleMania X8, while Hogan reportedly told McMahon the same regarding losing to Austin. In recent years, Austin claimed he didn't want the match as he didn't want to wrestle at a slower pace, and that he \"didn't think we could deliver.\" Consequently, Austin would face and defeat Scott Hall at WrestleMania.\n\nAustin no-showed the Raw after WrestleMania and took a week-long break without the company's consent, citing exhaustion. McMahon claimed his actions caused fury among fans who had paid to see him that night. Austin returned on the April 1 episode of Raw, the first of the new \"brand extension\" era. The show was centered around which show he would sign with, and he ultimately chose Raw. Austin entered a feud with The Undertaker that resulted in a number-one contender's match for the Undisputed WWF Championship at Backlash, which Austin lost despite having his foot on the rope when he was pinned. He would later be betrayed by Big Show after being put in a tag team match with him by Ric Flair, and was subsequently betrayed by Flair himself in the following weeks. Austin then defeated Big Show and Flair in a handicap match at Judgment Day. In a May 2002 interview on WWE's internet program, Byte This!, Austin stunned the company and fans by launching a verbal attack on the direction the company was heading in and slated the creative team for not using him the way he felt they previously did. The WWE rehired Eddie Guerrero for Austin to feud with, while also prepping Austin for a feud with Brock Lesnar. However, Austin balked at the proposition that he lose a King of the Ring qualifying match on Raw to Lesnar, and ultimately walked out of the company. Austin later explained that he thought hot-shotting a rookie made Austin look weak, and airing the match on free television with no build-up did not give Lesnar a proper stage for such a big win over a star of Austin's magnitude. Further fanning the flames amongst Austin's growing number of detractors was a well-publicized domestic dispute incident between Austin and his wife Debra (see below).\n\nAfter Austin again no-showed the June 10 episode of Raw, his storylines were immediately dropped. Austin had walked out of the company again, publicly stating he felt underwhelming storylines were presented to him by the creative team. This time his departure was for good. McMahon, along with longtime Austin supporter and real-life friend Jim Ross, buried Austin on WWE programming, referring to him as \"taking his ball and going home\" because he was not getting his way, whilst also explaining to the fans that neither he nor Ross was able to persuade Austin to change his mind. McMahon insisted that Austin owed an apology to all the fans across the world, especially those who paid solely to see him that night. McMahon toasted to Austin's career with a beer thanking him for all his hard work nonetheless. The same night, Austin's entrance theme was played during an in-ring segment by Flair, but it transitioned to Guerrero's theme and he entered the arena. The Rock also made an appearance on Raw that night, despite being drafted to SmackDown!, and announced his frustrations towards Austin and threw a can of beer at McMahon.\nFor the remainder of 2002, Austin kept a low profile and did not make any public appearances. It was reported, however, by the end of the year, that Austin and McMahon met and resolved their differences. He then agreed to return to the company in early 2003. In an interview with WWE Raw Magazine, he announced deep regret over the situation that led to his departure and the manner in which he had left, and deeper regret over inaccurate speculation regarding his alleged grudges held against other WWE wrestlers, claiming he had no problem with Hall rejoining the company. However, he admitted he still held strong reservations about his singles match with Hall at WrestleMania only lasting seven minutes and felt the build-up to the match did not live up to the expectations of his fans or Hall's, and was angered by speculation suggesting he disagreed with Kevin Nash re-joining the company, insisting he and Nash have always been good friends. He did, however, maintain his displeasure with the storylines and creative changes the WWE had imposed around the time of his departure. In an interview with Vince McMahon on his podcast in 2014, Austin publicly revealed for the first time that McMahon had fined him $650,000 upon his return, but he was able to lower the amount to $250,000.\nAustin confessed he had a major rift with Triple H's role in the company upon his return in 2002 but insisted as of 2003, they resolved their issues. Also, he claimed a brief dispute with The Rock was resolved quickly upon his return, and that none of his disputes with the talent roster continued or played the major part in his departure. In February, Austin returned at No Way Out by defeating Eric Bischoff. Austin would wrestle only one match between then and WrestleMania, in another short match against Bischoff on Raw. He entered a feud with The Rock, who returned around the same time as a smug, Hollywood sell-out heel. The Rock was offended that the WWE fans voted for Austin in a WWE Magazine poll to determine the 'Superstar of the Decade'. He expressed his frustration at having never defeated Austin at WrestleMania, and challenged Austin to a match at WrestleMania XIX. Austin was then defeated by The Rock at WrestleMania XIX, in what would be Austin's final match for 19 years.\n\nOn-screen authority figure (2003–2004)\nThe following month, Linda McMahon brought Austin back to be the co-general manager of Raw, a role he played for the remainder of the year, often getting into physical altercations with talent and personnel. Austin and Bischoff continued to feud over control of the brand. On the July 21 episode of Raw, McMahon informed Austin he could not get physical with anyone unless provoked. At Survivor Series, Austin's hand-picked team of Booker T, Bubba Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley, Rob Van Dam and Shawn Michaels faced Bischoff's team of Chris Jericho, Christian, Mark Henry, Randy Orton and Scott Steiner in a 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match. Austin's team lost after Batista interfered on behalf of Bischoff. As a result, Austin was \"fired\" from his position as co-general manager. Mick Foley took over Austin's former role and began petitioning to have Austin re-instated. Austin returned before the end of 2003, appearing at Tribute to the Troops. He posed as Santa Claus before delivering a \"Stone Cold Stunner\" to both Mr. McMahon and John Cena. Austin returned to Raw on December 29 as its \"Sheriff\", giving a Stone Cold Stunner to Bischoff and rehiring Michaels, who had just been \"fired\" by Bischoff. Austin appeared on-and-off as 2004 began, culminating in him being the special guest referee for the Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg match at WrestleMania XX. Following said match, Austin attacked both Lesnar and Goldberg with Stone Cold Stunners.\n\nPart-time appearances (2005–2011)\nOn April 3, 2005, Austin made his first appearance on WWE programming in a year at WrestleMania 21 when he appeared with Roddy Piper on Piper's Pit. They were interrupted by Carlito, who received a Stone Cold Stunner. The segment ended with Austin and Piper celebrating with beer until Austin gave Piper a Stone Cold Stunner. Austin was involved in the concluding segment at ECW One Night Stand in which he had a beer bash with the ECW locker room and brawled with the anti-ECW invaders, led by Bischoff. He returned at Raw Homecoming, delivering Stone Cold Stunners to Vince, Shane, Stephanie, and Linda McMahon. An angle including Jim Ross being fired led to a match in which Austin agreed to face Jonathan Coachman at Taboo Tuesday, with the stipulation of Ross regaining his announcing job had Austin won and Austin losing his job had he lost. Austin hurt his back before the match and could not wrestle unless he was heavily medicated, so the match was canceled. To explain away his failure to appear at Taboo Tuesday, Vince McMahon said on Raw that Austin had been involved in an accident, thus preventing him from competing. Batista substituted for Austin, defeating Coachman along with Vader and Goldust.\nHe returned to WWE to face John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) in a beer-drinking contest at March 18, 2006, episode of Saturday Night's Main Event XXXII. Austin inducted Bret Hart into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 1, 2006.\n\nAustin returned to WWE programming in March 2007, partially to promote his starring role in the release of WWE Films' production The Condemned. On March 31, he inducted Jim Ross into the Hall of Fame. At WrestleMania 23, Austin was the special guest referee for the match between Bobby Lashley and Umaga. If Lashley lost, his manager Donald Trump's head would be shaved, and if Umaga lost, his manager Vince McMahon's head would be shaved. During the match, Austin delivered Stone Cold Stunners to Umaga, Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon, and Trump. Lashley won the match; Trump, Austin, and Lashley then shaved McMahon's head. Austin ended the show by hitting the Stone Cold Stunner on both Vince and Trump. He then appeared in a video on the June 11 episode of Raw as part of \"Mr. McMahon's Appreciation Night\", where he shared his thoughts on his past feuds with McMahon. Austin appeared on the August 18 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, as a possible illegitimate child of McMahon. He hit McMahon and Coachman with Stone Cold Stunners before leaving. He appeared at SummerSlam to aid Matt Hardy in battling MVP in a beer-drinking contest. The match ended in a no-contest after Austin handed a beer to MVP and gave him the Stone Cold Stunner. Austin made another appearance at Cyber Sunday, where he guest refereed a World Heavyweight Championship match between Batista and The Undertaker. On the November 5 episode of Raw, Austin made an appearance to confront Santino Marella for criticizing The Condemned. The argument ended as Marella received a Stone Cold Stunner from Austin, who then walked backstage only to return with a Budweiser beer truck to hose down Marella and his valet Maria with beer. Austin appeared on the Raw 15th Anniversary special, attacking Vince McMahon.\nOn October 26, 2008, at Cyber Sunday, Austin was the special guest referee during a match between Batista and Chris Jericho for the World Heavyweight Championship. On January 12, 2009, on Raw, Austin was announced to be the first member of the Hall of Fame class of 2009. He was inducted by his long-term on-screen rival Vince McMahon, who referred to Austin as \"the greatest WWE Superstar of all time\". During the induction, Austin said he was officially closing the door on his wrestling career and starting a new chapter in his life. He would appear at WrestleMania 25 the next night, driving an ATV to the ring. Austin appeared as the guest host of Raw on March 15, 2010, moderating a contract signing between McMahon and Bret Hart for their match at WrestleMania XXVI.\nIn early 2011, Austin was announced as the head trainer and host for the revival of Tough Enough. On the March 7 episode of Raw, Austin interrupted the contract signing of the special guest referee for the Michael Cole and Jerry Lawler match at WrestleMania XXVII, originally scheduled to be JBL; Austin attacked JBL with a Stone Cold Stunner and signed the contract instead. Although Lawler won by submission, the Anonymous Raw General Manager reversed the decision and disqualified Lawler, claiming that Austin had \"overstepped his authority.\" Austin appeared on Raw the following night with the cast from Tough Enough, while also getting into an altercation with The Miz and Alex Riley. On the June 6 episode of Raw, Austin appeared to declare Andy Leavine as the winner of Tough Enough. He also served as the special guest referee in the evening's tag team main event of John Cena and Alex Riley against The Miz and R-Truth, hitting Miz with a Stone Cold Stunner and aiding Cena. However, the Anonymous Raw General Manager awarding the match to The Miz and R-Truth via disqualification. Austin did not take kindly to his decision being overturned and gave Cole a Stone Cold Stunner, which was followed with an Attitude Adjustment by Cena. Austin and Cena closed the show with a beer bash. Austin later appeared as the special guest General Manager on the \"WWE All-Stars\" episode of Raw, during which he destroyed the Anonymous Raw General Manager's laptop by running over it with his ATV.\n\nSporadic appearances and one-off return to competition (2012–2022)\nIn July 2012, Austin was announced as the cover star of the special edition of the video game WWE '13. He then began a brief, verbal feud on Raw (WWE brand) with fellow cover star CM Punk in the months leading to release.\n\nAustin appeared at WrestleMania XXX on April 6, 2014, with Hulk Hogan and The Rock in the opening segment. Austin made an appearance on the October 19, 2015, episode of Raw, introducing The Undertaker and promoting the WrestleMania 32 event. Austin again appeared on Raw the following week, where he promoted the WWE 2K16 video game in a backstage segment. At WrestleMania 32 on April 3, 2016, Austin (alongside Mick Foley and Shawn Michaels) confronted The League of Nations, with Austin delivering Stone Cold Stunners to Rusev and King Barrett. While Austin was celebrating with Michaels and Foley, The New Day tried to convince Austin to dance with them in celebration. While Austin reluctantly danced along at first, he soon hit Xavier Woods with a Stone Cold Stunner.\nDuring Raw's 25th anniversary episode on January 22, 2018, Austin appeared and performed a Stone Cold Stunner on Shane and Vince McMahon.\nOn March 7, 2022, Kevin Owens invited Austin as a special guest on the KO Show at WrestleMania 38 following several promos where Owens disrespected Austin's native Texas, where WrestleMania 38 was scheduled to take place. The next day, Austin accepted the invite. At the end of WrestleMania 38 Night One, Owens revealed that the invite to talk on the KO show was a ruse and that he actually wanted to fight Austin. He challenged Austin to a No Holds Barred match, which Austin accepted, marking his first wrestling match in WWE in over 19 years. He would go on to win after hitting Owens with a Stone Cold Stunner. After the match, Austin gave another Stone Cold Stunner to Owens and one to Byron Saxton before celebrating with his brother, Kevin. The match received positive reviews from critics, with Kevin Pantoja of 411Mania and John Canton of TJR Wrestling giving the match a rating of 3.5/5 and 3/5 stars, respectively. Both noted the high entertainment value of Austin's return, aside from the rating of the match itself. On Night Two of WrestleMania 38, after Mr. McMahon defeated Pat McAfee in an impromptu match, Austin made another appearance, giving Austin Theory a Stone Cold Stunner. He then began drinking beer with McMahon before hitting him with a one more iconic Stone Cold Stunner, paying homage to how the majority of on-screen interactions between the two have ended for almost 25 years. Austin then toasted with McAfee but hit him with a Stone Cold Stunner too.\n\nLegacy\nSince his retirement in 2003, Austin has been widely regarded and cited as one of the greatest and most influential professional wrestlers of all time. Sports Illustrated ranked him third on their top 101 greatest wrestlers of all-time list. In 2020, SPORTbible ranked Austin as the greatest wrestler of all time. He has been described as the most influential wrestler in Raw history, and the poster boy for the Attitude Era. Several former world champions have named Austin as part of their \"Mount Rushmore\" of wrestling, including The Rock, The Undertaker, Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, and John Cena, and a 2012 poll conducted by WWE saw Austin picked second on a fan voted version of the concept. When Vince McMahon inducted Austin into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009, he referred to Austin as \"the greatest WWE superstar of all time\".\nAustin was the biggest box office draw in WWE since Hulk Hogan. His contributions in saving WWF and winning the Monday Night Wars against WCW helped future superstars like John Cena, who would go onto establish WWE as a global brand. He headlined WrestleMania X-Seven, the first WrestleMania to achieve a 1 million buy rate. The event was universally acclaimed and is often regarded as the greatest pay-per-view in professional wrestling history. It is also noted as the pinnacle of the Attitude Era, occurring just a week after WWE bought out their competition, WCW. \nDuring his early years as a wrestler, Austin was a technical wrestler. However, after Owen Hart accidentally injured Austin's neck in 1997, Austin changed his style from technical to brawler. His most famous finishing move is the Stone Cold Stunner, and he credits Michael Hayes with introducing the move to him. Following his retirement, he gave permission to Kevin Owens to use the move as his own finisher, but both have downplayed comparisons between the two. During his time as The Ringmaster, he used the Million Dollar Dream as a finishing move since it was Ted DiBiase's finisher. During his time in WCW, Austin used the Stun Gun (a move innovated by Eddie Gilbert as the Hot Shot) and the Hollywood & Vine (a standing modified figure-four leglock) as his finishers.\nSporting a bald head and goatee, coupled with his ring attire which consisted of plain black trunks and boots, Austin relied solely on his personality to become popular. As \"Stone Cold\", Austin was portrayed on-screen as an anti-authority rebel who would consistently cuss and defy the company rules and guidelines of WWE Chairman Vince McMahon. One of Austin's taunts during the Attitude Era was to show the middle finger. To complement his persona, Austin was the recipient of two additional nicknames, commentator and friend Jim Ross dubbed him \"The Texas Rattlesnake\" due to the character's \"mannerisms, the motivation, the mindset, you can't trust this son of a bitch\", while Austin later named himself \"The Bionic Redneck\" on account of the injuries he had suffered to his arms, neck and knees. Austin has said he is \"eternally indebted\" to Ross for helping his character become popular.\nOn both his podcasts, Austin credited Bret Hart as the wrestler who got him over the most, had most influence on his early wrestling style, and who he had his best matches with. Austin would later go on to induct Bret Hart into the WWE Hall of Fame. The match between Austin and Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13 has been widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestling matches of all time, and has been voted by IGN as the greatest match in WrestleMania history, and was number 1 among their list of top 20 WrestleMania matches of all time.\nA 12-minute match between Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin drew a 9.5 rating on June 28, 1999. It stands as the highest-rated segment in Raw history.\nAccording to the data collected by US-bookies, Stone Cold Steve Austin is still WWE’s best merchandise seller earning an estimated $3,600,000 from merchandise on WWE Shop site. John Cena takes the #2 spot, earning almost $2,700,000 from WWE Shop. 'Austin 3:16' T-shirt is amongst the best selling T-shirts in wrestling history\nIn August 2001, Austin began using his catchphrase \"What?\" to interrupt wrestlers who were trying to speak and to allow fan participation chants. Audiences at WWE shows have since widely used this chant during performer promos, and Austin has stated his regret at inventing the chant. Austin's entrance theme was composed by Jim Johnston, who said that in composing the song, he looked upon Austin's persona as an \"ass-kicker guy who did not enter a room with subtlety. He needed something that reflected that\". Looking to capture the unpredictable nature of the character, Johnston thought of using the sounds of a car crash and smashing glass, and recalled that he instantly felt the theme fit the character and that \"it felt like it had already been his theme for years\". Austin says the song was inspired by Rage Against the Machine's song \"Bulls on Parade\". The theme song was revamped in 2000, with the rock band Disturbed recording the new version, used for the first time at the Unforgiven PPV event in September. Austin's entrance theme is regarded as one of the greatest of all time, and one which defined the Attitude Era.\n\nOther media\nActing and hosting\nAustin had guest roles on Celebrity Deathmatch and Seasons 4 and 5 of CBS's Nash Bridges, where he played San Francisco Police Department Inspector Jake Cage. He has appeared on V.I.P and Dilbert. His motion picture debut was in a supporting role as Guard Dunham in the 2005 remake of The Longest Yard. Austin had his first starring film role, as Jack Conrad, a dangerous convict awaiting execution in a Salvadoran prison, who takes part in an illegal deathmatch game that is being broadcast to the public in the 2007 action film The Condemned. In 2010, Austin appeared in The Expendables as Dan Paine, the right-hand man for the primary antagonist of the film James Munroe, played by Eric Roberts, and bodyguard with Gary Daniels who plays The Brit. Shortly after Austin re-teamed with Eric Roberts and Gary Daniels in Hunt to Kill. It was his last American theatrical release film until 2013. Austin appeared as Hugo Panzer on television series Chuck. He has also starred in Damage, The Stranger, Tactical Force, Knockout, Recoil, Maximum Conviction, and The Package.\nIn April 2013, Austin started a weekly podcast named The Steve Austin Show which is family-friendly, while his second podcast The Steve Austin Show – Unleashed! is more adult-oriented. As of May 2015, the podcasts averaged 793,000 downloads a week and had nearly 200 million overall downloads. In February 2018, Austin announced that the \"Unleashed\" version of the podcast had been dropped and merged with the family-friendly version in order to appeal to more sponsors. The podcast has also transitioned to a live broadcast for the WWE Network (podcasted after a short exclusivity period) with monthly specials since 2014. In November 2019, Austin began an interview segment on the WWE Network called the Broken Skull Sessions, taking its name from the ranch owned by Austin. The premiere episode featured The Undertaker.\nAustin hosted the reality competition show Redneck Island on CMT, which began in June 2012 and concluded with its fifth season in April 2016. In July 2014, his reality competition show Steve Austin's Broken Skull Challenge premiered on CMT. The show entered into its fifth season in September 2017.\n\nFilmography\nMusic videos\nVideo games\nPersonal life\nAustin played college football at the University of North Texas. Austin married his high school girlfriend Kathryn Burrhus on November 24, 1990. However, he later pursued a relationship with English wrestling manager Jeanie Clarke, with whom he was working. His marriage to Burrhus was annulled on August 7, 1992, and he married Clarke on December 18. They had two daughters, Stephanie (born 1992) and Cassidy (born 1996), before divorcing on May 10, 1999. Austin also adopted Clarke's daughter Jade from a previous relationship with Chris Adams. In 2010, Austin became a grandfather for the first time when Jade gave birth to a son. Since then Jade had two more children with her husband Adam Bryniarski, a British independent wrestler. Bryniarski died in 2022 at age 41.\nOn September 13, 2000, Austin married wrestling manager Debra Marshall. On June 15, 2002, Marshall called the police to the couple's home. She told officers that Austin had hit her and then stormed out of the house before police arrived. An arrest warrant was issued by the Bexar County district attorney's office on August 12 and Austin turned himself in the following day, at which point he was charged with domestic abuse. He pleaded no contest on November 25, and was given a year's probation, a $1,000 fine, and ordered to carry out 80 hours of community service. In 2007, Marshall told Fox News that WWE knew of the abuse, but worked to keep her from revealing that Austin had hit her as it would cost the company millions of dollars. Austin responded to the incident in 2003 through WWE Raw Magazine, citing his regret over their relationship breaking down and stating his love for Marshall. He also ridiculed allegations that the incident was alcohol-related. He filed for divorce from Marshall on July 22, 2002, which was finalized on February 5, 2003.\nIn March 2003, during the hours leading up to WrestleMania XIX, Austin was rushed to the hospital for twitchiness and a high heart rate.\nIn 2003, Austin denied allegations that he was an alcoholic, stating that wrestling fans had mistaken his character's excessive consumption of beer as a real-life trait of his and insisting that he drinks responsibly. In March 2004, he was accused of assaulting his then-girlfriend Tess Broussard during a dispute at his home in San Antonio, Texas, according to a police report. No arrests were made and no charges were filed in the case.\nIn 2007, the Wrestling Observer newsletter reported that Austin had legally changed his name to Steve Austin.\nIn late 2009, Austin married his fourth wife, Kristin Feres.\nIn 2014, Austin voiced support for same-sex marriage on his podcast. Also in 2014, Austin released his first beer, Broken Skull IPA, with El Segundo Brewing Company in California. In March 2022, they released another collaboration, Broken Skull American Lager. The beers are distributed in 35 states with El Segundo brewing over 5,000 barrels of Broken Skull annually.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nCauliflower Alley Club\nIron Mike Mazurki Award (2012)\nGuinness World Records\nWorld record: Most wins of the WWE Royal Rumble (3 times)\nInternational Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame\nClass of 2022\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\nFeud of the Year (1998, 1999) vs. Vince McMahon\nMatch of the Year (1997) vs. Bret Hart in a submission match at WrestleMania 13\nMost Hated Wrestler of the Year (2001)\nMost Popular Wrestler of the Year (1998)\nRookie of the Year (1990)\nWrestler of the Year (1998, 1999, 2001)\nRanked No. 1 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 1998 and 1999\nRanked No. 19 of the top 500 singles wrestlers of the PWI Years in 2003\nRanked No. 50 of the top 100 tag teams of the PWI Years with Brian Pillman in 2003\nStanley Weston Award (2019)\nProfessional Wrestling Hall of Fame\nClass of 2016\nTexas Wrestling Federation\nTWA Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Rod Price\nWorld Championship Wrestling\nWCW World Television Championship (2 times)\nWCW United States Heavyweight Championship (2 times)\nWCW World Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Brian Pillman\nNWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Brian Pillman\nWorld Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE\nWWF Championship (6 times)\nWWF Intercontinental Championship (2 times)\nWWF Tag Team Championship (4 times) – with Shawn Michaels (1), Dude Love (1), The Undertaker (1), and Triple H (1)\nMillion Dollar Championship (1 time)\nKing of the Ring (1996)\nRoyal Rumble (1997, 1998, 2001)\nUndisputed WWF Championship #1 Contenders Tournament (2002)\nFifth Triple Crown Champion\nSlammy Award (2 times)\nFreedom of Speech (1997)\nBest Original WWE Network Show – Stone Cold Podcast (2015)\nWWE Hall of Fame (Class of 2009)\nWrestling Observer Newsletter\nBest Box Office Draw (1998, 1999)\nBest Brawler (2001)\nBest Gimmick (1997, 1998)\nBest Heel (1996)\nBest on Interviews (1996–1998, 2001)\nBest Non-Wrestler (2003)\nFeud of the Year (1997) vs. The Hart Foundation\nFeud of the Year (1998, 1999) vs. Vince McMahon\nMatch of the Year (1997) vs. Bret Hart in a submission match at WrestleMania 13\nMost Charismatic (1997, 1998)\nRookie of the Year (1990)\nTag Team of the Year (1993) with Brian Pillman as The Hollywood Blonds\nWorst Worked Match of the Year (1991) with Terrance Taylor vs. Bobby Eaton and P.

It appears to be stretched vertically on the infobox, but it is not stretched according to the Wikipedia Commons page (see [1]). Why is this? - RockinJack18 03:58, 20 October 2024 (UTC)\n\nRockinJack18, I see no stretching on an Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G smartphone using the desktop site. The photo looks normal to me. Cullen328 (talk) 04:49, 20 October 2024 (UTC)\nLooks like it was updated, thanks for checking! - RockinJack18 05:06, 20 October 2024 (UTC)\n@RockinJack18: You asked why it happened so here is the technical explanation. When an Internet page contains an image, the page can optionally specify a display height and width of the image, even if it's the same as the actual image file. It helps the browser reserve the right space for the image so other content isn't shuffled around when the image is read later and the browser discovers the size. MediaWiki automatically does this. If a new version of an image is uploaded, the height-width ratio may change. MediaWiki sometimes has a delay in updating the specified size in pages using the image (or a page version with the old size may be cached by your browser). Then the browser will stretch the image to satisfy the specified size. It's possible (not sure) that purging the page will help.

I am very familiar with this story due to the coverage here in New Zealand. An editor who is closely linked to the subject has shared a fair statement on the emotional stress that this Alex Breingan has brought to the subject here [3].  \nUpon looking at the article itself, every single note about the financial issues and legal issues are cited from just one reporter. This is not giving it a neutral POV at all as per the rules with Wikipedia. The only other reporter out of the section talked about a website that was setup and questioned here [4] and about the recievership issues [5] but every single else source is from a single reporter under the Media Insider section of the NZ Herald. This needs to be adjusted and fixed so it's neutral. It's not fair on the subject with a single reporter writing these articles which the subject hasn't even talked back about them being true or not. It's a horrible way of writing without any balance. \nThe comment earlier claims that they aren't true, alot of the facts. Thank you. Can any experienced editors go and take a look at this? The friend of the subject has asked if the article can be deleted. If this is an option, can this happen? Thank you. It's just very unbalanced, the entire article and shouldn't be mostly cited from one single reporter. The New Zealand Investigation section should be cited from the source of the people doing the investigation, not from a reporter who is reporting everything about the subject. And the furniture purchases is completely a civil issue, not related to his company. \nAnother editor replied to where I posted this earlier [Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard#Alex Breingan] and said:\n\nIt's definitely a crappy article (which are legion on Wkipedia), with the financial/legal issues over-emphasized, overly-detailed (WP:VNOTSUFF) and written in pedantic Wikipedia:Proseline, as if every single news article warrants a new paragraph. The section should be consolidated into a couple paragraphs, to summarize without being so tedious, although some will probably scream \"whitewashing!!!\". --Animalparty!\nCan any admins go through please and clean up this article?

Also, I was wrong about the talkpage anyway: it transcludes {{DYK talk}}.For my somewhat recent experience with this type of thing, you can see how it was handled at Help talk:Your first article/Archive 4. The upside to this is that talkpage threads referring to a specific article title are sequestered from one another; the downside is that users' contribs will appear to have been made directly to the archive (since it is a move target rather than copypasted by an archive bot).I don't really feel like doing a thorough examination of Talk:Cheese dream/Archive 1 to see whether it would make sense to histmerge the talkpage archives, but I note after a brief naive search that as of eight years ago, the vibe seems to have been talkpages of merged articles usually don't get merged.

This is why I am thinking of creating a separate article on the issue.\nI want to know whether - as far as Wikipedia rules are concerned - creating a new page on this topic is legit or not.\nThanks. ParallelDimension (talk) 17:38, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\n\nThe dispute is covered by reliable sources. My suggestion is to create a neutral well-referenced section about it at WordPress. If that section grows too long, that would be the time to create a spin-off article. Frankly, since you are a new editor, it would be very difficult for you to successfully create a freestanding article about a dispute between two tech companies. Cullen328 (talk) 20:44, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nTo add to Cullen's answer: My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about  trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft.

Basically, an IP user (45.186.112.244) made an edit to a section of the article that introduced a lot of problems, and involved deleting a lot of entries and breaking a lot of links (I'll spare you the details but suffice to say there were a lot of redlinks afterward). A few other users then gradually changed back parts of the section (each edit only fixed a few links at a time), and I cleaned up what remained.\nBut that still leaves the problem of the deleted entries. I'd love to just revert it, but a lot of those edits afterward also added information (mostly countries of origin) that would be lost if I reverted it back to the version right before the bad edit, and would be cumbersome to add back manually. I'm wondering if there is perhaps a way to merge that version with the current version of the article to fix all the problems that edit caused without sacrificing the info other people added afterwards. I know similar things are possible, like when two people edit an article at the same time, but I don't know if it's possible to do it manually and I don't know if it would even produce the right result. Any other information on how to potentially solve this problem is also welcome.\nBest regards, TypoEater (talk) 22:22, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\n\nI think what you are proposing would be possible by first doing a history split then doing a selective history merge but I might be wrong about that.

GeorgeMemulous (talk) 01:29, 22 October 2024 (UTC)\n\nGeorgeMemulous, I find your question pretty vague but I will try my best to answer. Although use of primary sources is not forbidden, reliable secondary sources are preferred. They are one step removed from the original observation, and can analyze, compare and fact check primary sources. Such secondary sources provide the best source material for Wikipedia editors to summarize. When using a secondary source that discusses and analyzes a primary source, you need to read the secondary source, but it is not necessary that you read the primary source mentioned, although you can do so if you wish. As it were, the author of the secondary source has done that reading for you.

I think that sources in Cryptoterrestrial hypothesis should be reduced to remove some that are not notable and then the remainder should be merged with Hollow Earth. I would need to look into the sources to have an opinion on the final title. I reverted the redirect because it was done with no discussion and contrary to the work by five or six editors in building the article, reviewing it in AfC, and editing it into its current form. It was done with no discussion of the notability of the topic, the references, or the need, or lack thereof, for two articles.

I noticed some of this too when I came in as an uninvolved editor from the noticeboard discussion.\nAt Wikipedia, we have a concept called WP:WIKILAWYERING that we try to avoid. You've been given guidance on that partially through WP:NOTBURO policy and WP:DRNC already, but I mention that because I do believe it would be helpful for you to learn more about this and how to avoid it in disputes. Simply because someone makes a bold redirect does not mean you are justified in automatically undoing the redirect simply because there wasn't discussion (that is the nature of a bold redirect). There needs to be actual reason that the redirect is undone, not bureaucratic ones. You keep using the word \"process\" but are misunderstanding how the process works. Not every redirect has to go through RfD/AfD, especially when editors agree on it and there's consensus for it.\nWhen the redirect was initially done, another editor left the edit summary, Per WP:FTN. Content history preserved. You can try to incorporate this stuff over there if you think it deserves WP:WEIGHT. . .. Especially since you also agree with the merge, it becomes WP:POINTY when you edit war over the redirect. Just simply work on the target article for content you think should be merged in. KoA (talk) 03:31, 23 October 2024 (UTC)\nEither way, @Johnjbarton and @Bon courage are edit warring and both need to stop and discuss it. ColinFine (talk) 20:46, 22 October 2024 (UTC)\nYes, that is why I am here. Johnjbarton (talk) 22:52, 22 October 2024 (UTC)\n\n\n= October 23 =\n\nAmerican singer, Toni Fisher.\nAmerican singer toni fisher was listed as being born on 4th. of December 1924. But other sources say that she was born 1931. What is the correct date? 180.150.38.127 (talk) 00:18, 23 October 2024 (UTC)\n\nHi IP 180.150.38.127. The correct date of birth for Toni Fisher may be something that Wikipedia is unable to determine on its own. Wikipedia content, in principle, is only intended to reflect what's written in reliable sources; so, if reliable sources state that Fisher was born on December 4, 1924, then that's pretty much what the Wikipedia article is going to be expected to say as well. Of course, in some cases, reliable sources may give different dates of birth for the subject of an article, and in such cases Wikipedia content may reflect or otherwise make mention of such differences. So, if you think that's the case here, you can either try to add content to the article regarding the discrepancy in reliable sources with respect to her date of birth yourself, or you can start a discussion about it at Talk:Toni Fisher. Please be advised though that Wikipedia defines reliable sources in a specific way, and not everything found on the Internet is, for example, going to be considered a reliable source.The Find a Grave page cited being cited as a source in the article isn't really considered a reliable source for Wikipedia's purposes per WP:RS/P#Find a Grave; however, somebody uploaded an image of a newspaper obituary for Fisher under her married name \"Toni F. Monzello\" to Find A Grave and that could be a reliable source for such information; unfortunately, only a clipping of the obituary is shown without any identifying information to the newspaper in comes from. The obituary does give her date of birth as December 4, 1924, but there's no real way to verify the source without knowing more about the paper it comes from. -- Marchjuly (talk) 01:13, 23 October 2024 (UTC)\n\nUndefined refs\nIf someone could help out the IP at Talk:Attention_Is_All_You_Need#undefined_references that would be awesome.

Franz Meyer (Q94784222) appears consistent with Franz Meyer. The images look like the same person at different ages. Wikidata calls him an astronomer and physician. Franz Meyer says engineer but also says he improved astronomical telescopes. Maybe physician should have been physicist. Those words are sometimes confused. PrimeHunter (talk) 09:57, 23 October 2024 (UTC)\n@Nawennschon: I see that you translated de:Franz Meyer (Ingenieur) as Franz Meyer. \"(Ingenieur)\" is added to the German article name because there are several articles on de Wikipedia with similar names and de:Franz Meyer is the list of people of that name with de Wikipedia articles. en Wikipedia only has one such article , so it does not need the extra \"(engineer)\". The Wikidata item Franz Meyer (Q94784222) is linked to de:Franz Meyer (Ingenieur) so I have linked it to the new English article.\nI would recommend reading help:Translation to understand the issues in translating from other Wikipedia projects, e.g. de Wikipedia does not require that content should have Wikipedia:Inline citations.

        "content": "A wargame is a strategy game in which two or more players command opposing armed forces in a simulation of an armed conflict. Wargaming may be played for recreation, to train military officers in the art of strategic thinking, or to study the nature of potential conflicts. Many wargames re-create specific historic battles, and can cover either whole wars, or any campaigns, battles, or lower-level engagements within them. Many simulate land combat, but there are wargames for naval, air combat, and cyber as well as many that combine various domains.\nThere is ambiguity as to whether or not activities where participants physically perform mock combat actions (e.g. friendly warships firing dummy rounds at each other) are considered wargames. It is common terminology for a military's field training exercises to be referred to as \"live wargames\", but certain institutions such as the US Navy do not accept this. Likewise, activities like paintball and airsoft are often classified as combat sports. In contrast however the War Olympics also calls itself “the international army games” and often is referred to as wargaming colloquially.\nModern wargaming was invented in Prussia in the early 19th-century, and eventually the Prussian military adopted wargaming as a tool for training their officers and developing doctrine. After Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War, wargaming was widely adopted by military officers in other countries. Civilian enthusiasts also played wargames for fun, but this was a niche hobby until the development of consumer electronic wargames in the 1990s.\n\nProfessional vs recreational\nA professional wargame is a wargame that is used by a military as a serious tool for training or research. A recreational wargame is one played for fun, often in a competitive context.\nRecreational wargames can cover a wide variety of subjects, from pre-historic to modern – even fantasy or sci-fi combat. Games which do not include modern armaments and tactics are of limited interest to the military, though wargames covering famous historical battles can interest military historians. As professional wargames are used to prepare officers for actual warfare, there is naturally a strong emphasis on realism and current events.\nMilitary organizations are typically secretive about their current wargames, and this makes designing a professional wargame a challenge. The data the designers require, such as the performance characteristics of weapons or the locations of military bases, are often classified, which makes it difficult for the designers to verify that their models are accurate. Secrecy also makes it harder to disseminate corrections if the wargame has already been delivered to the clients. Then there is the small player base. Whereas a commercial wargame might have thousands or even millions of players, professional wargames tend to have small player bases, which makes it harder for the designers to acquire feedback. Consequently, errors in professional wargame models tend to persist.\nAlthough commercial wargame designers study consumer trends and listen to player feedback, their products are usually designed and sold with a take-it-or-leave-it approach. Professional wargames, by contrast, are typically commissioned by the military that plans to use them. If a wargame is commissioned by several clients, then the designer will have to juggle their competing demands. This can lead to great complexity, high development costs, and a compromised product that satisfies nobody.\nCommercial wargames are under more pressure to deliver an enjoyable experience for the players, who expect a user-friendly interface, a reasonable learning curve, exciting gameplay, and so forth. By contrast, military organizations tend to see wargaming as a tool and a chore, and players are often bluntly obliged to use whatever is provided to them.\nProfessional wargames that are arbitrated by an umpire or the players themselves (manual wargames) tend to have simple models and computations compared to recreational wargames. Umpires may even be allowed to make arbitrary decisions using their own expertise. One reason for this is to keep the learning curve small. Recreational wargamers tend to have a lot of wargaming experience (it is usually considered a hardcore hobby), so learning a complicated new wargame is easy if it is similar enough to ones they've already played. By contrast, military officers typically have little or no wargaming experience. A second reason is that the technical data required to design an accurate and precise model, such as the performance characteristics of a fighter jet, is often classified.\n\nOverview\nThe exact definition of \"wargame\" varies from one writer to the next and one organization to the next. To prevent confusion, this section will establish the general definition employed by this article.\n\nA wargame simulates an armed conflict, be it a battle, a campaign, or an entire war. Business wargames do not simulate armed conflict and thus fall outside the scope of this article.\nA wargame is adversarial. There must be at least two opposing sides whose players react intelligently to each other's decisions, though there are wargames with solitaire rules to govern the actions of the non-player side(s).\nA wargame does not involve the use of actual troops and armaments. This definition is used by the US Naval War College. Some writers use the term \"live wargames\" to refer to games that use actual troops in the field, but this article shall instead refer to these as field exercises.\n\nSetting and scenario\nA wargame must have a setting that is based on some historical era of warfare so as to establish what armaments, unit types, and doctrines the combatants may wield and the environment they fight in. A historical setting accurately depicts a real historical era of warfare. Among recreational wargamers, the most popular historical era is World War 2. Professional military wargamers prefer the modern era. A fantasy setting depicts a fictional world in which the combatants wield fictional or anachronistic armaments, but it should be similar enough to some historical era of warfare such that the combatants fight in a familiar and credible way. For instance, Warhammer Age of Sigmar has wizards and dragons, but the combat is mostly based on medieval warfare (spearmen, archers, knights, etc.). Some are also set in a hypothetical future or counterfactual past, to simulate, for example, a \"World War Three\" or rebellion of colonists on Mars.\nA wargame's scenario describes the circumstances of the specific conflict being simulated, from the layout of the terrain to the exact composition of the fighting forces to the victory conditions of the players. Historical wargames often re-enact historical battles. Alternatively, the game may provide fictional \"what-if\" scenarios. One challenge in the design of historical wargames is that the scenarios may be inherently unbalanced and present one side with an unwinnable situation. In such cases, the victory conditions may be adjusted for the disadvantaged side so that they can win simply by doing better than what happened historically. Some games simply concede that the scenario is imbalanced and urge players to switch sides and play again to compare their performance. It is easier to design a balanced scenario where all players have a fair chance of winning if it is fictionalized. Board wargames usually have a fixed scenario.\n\nLevel of war\nA wargame's level of war determines to the scope of the scenario, the basic unit of command, and the degree to which lower level processes are abstracted.\nAt the tactical level, the scenario is a single battle. The basic unit of command is an individual soldier or small group of soldiers. The time span of the scenario is in the order of minutes. At this level, the specific capabilities of the soldiers and their armaments are described in detail. An example of a tactical-level games is Flames of War, in which players use miniature figurines to represent individual soldiers, and move them around on a scale model of the battlefield.\nAt the operational level, the scenario is a military campaign, and the basic unit of command is a large group of soldiers. At this level, the outcomes of battles are usually determined by a simple computation.\nAt the strategic level, the scenario is an entire war. The player addresses higher-level concerns such as economics, research, and diplomacy. The time span of the game is in the order of months or years.\n\nExamples\nFlames of War is a tactical-level historical miniature wargame that simulates land battles during World War 2.\nTACSPIEL is an operational-level professional wargame developed in the 1960s by the US Army for research into guerilla warfare.\nThe Sigma war games were a series of strategic-level professional wargames that sought to predict the outcome of the Vietnam War.\nHearts of Iron IV is a strategic-level computer wargame set in the mid-20th century.\nWings of War is tactical-level recreational wargame that simulates World War 1 aerial dogfights.\nStar Wars: X-Wing is a fantasy wargame whose rules are based on Wings of War.\nCommand: Modern Operations is a computer program that serves as a platform for users to create and share their own wargame of a hypothetical real world conflict (ranging from the tactical to the strategic level) using its database of units that range from World War 2 to the near future.\n\nDesign issues\nRealism\nA wargame must simulate warfare to a reasonable degree of realism, though what counts as sufficient realism depends on the players. Military wargames need to be highly realistic because their purpose is to prepare officers for real warfare. Recreational wargames only need to be as realistic as it pleases the players, so in most recreational wargames the emphasis is on verisimilitude, i.e. the satisfactory appearance of realism. In any case, no wargame can be perfectly realistic. A wargame's design must make trade-offs between realism, playability, and fun, and function within the constraints of its medium.\nFantasy wargames arguably stretch the definition of wargaming by representing fictional or anachronistic armaments, but they may still be called wargames if they resemble real warfare to the satisfaction of the players. For example, Warhammer Fantasy Battle has wizards and dragons, but the bulk of the armaments are taken from medieval warfare (spearmen, knights, archers, etc.).\nValidation is the process by which a given wargame is proven to be realistic. For historical wargames, this usually means being able to accurately recreate a certain historical battle. Validating military wargames is sometimes tricky as they are typically used to simulate hypothetical future scenarios.\n\nComplexity\nWhereas the rules of chess are relatively simple, and those of Go even simpler, with the complexity of these games an emergent property of the evolving strategic state of the board, wargames contrarily tend to have very sophisticated rules as a matter of their commitment to representing the concrete realities of (various kinds of) warfare. Generally speaking, the more realistic a wargame seeks to be, the more complicated its rules are.\nFor example, chess pieces only have a few rules determining their behaviour, such as how and when they are allowed to move or capture based on their type and board location, providing a highly abstracted model of warfare which represents troop composition and positioning. Stones in Go have no properties, behaviours, or state on their own, and only potentially represent, relative to other stones, elements of a larger board position, providing an extremely abstract strategic model in which the determinant of victory is a generalisation of territorial control and influence projection. Contrarily, in wargames counters typically represent decidedly more concrete and internally quite complex entities (companies, battalions, etc.), with detailed interior state (stat blocks and tables of troop numbers, equipment, operational readiness, artillery charts, etc.), often with convoluted rules governing how they operate and interact, and furthermore the global state of the game is often governed by extensive non-local rules representing exigencies like seasonal weather or supply lines.\nThis makes wargames difficult to learn, as it can be difficult to simply begin playing without already understanding a great deal about how to do so. Even experienced wargamers usually play with their rulebook on hand, because the rules for most wargames are too complex to fully memorize. For many people, the complexity also makes wargames difficult to enjoy, but some players enjoy high realism, so finding a balance between realism and simplicity is tricky when it comes to recreational wargames.\nOne way to solve the problem of complexity is to use a referee who has the discretion to arbitrate events, using whatever tools and knowledge they deem fit. This solution is popular with military instructors because it allows them to apply their own expertise when they use wargames to instruct students. The drawback of this approach is that the referee must be very knowledgeable in warfare and impartial, else they may issue unrealistic or unfair rulings.\nAnother way to address complexity is to use a computer to automate some or all of the routine procedures. Video games can be both sophisticated and easy to learn, which is why computer wargames are more popular than tabletop wargames.\n\nScale\nEvery wargame must have a sense of scale, so that it may realistically simulate how topography, distance, and time affect warfare. Scale is usually expressed as a ratio, e.g. a scale of 1:1000 indicates that 1 cm on the game map represents 10 m (1,000 cm). In miniature wargaming, scale is more often expressed as the height of a model of a human measured from the base of its feet up to the eyes or top of the head (e.g. 28mm).\nMilitary wargames typically aim to model time and space as realistically as is feasible, so everything in the simulation conforms to a single scale. Recreational wargame designers, by contrast, tend to use abstract scaling techniques to make their wargames easier to learn and play. Tabletop miniature wargames, for instance, cannot realistically model the range of modern firearms, because miniature wargaming models are typically built to a scale between 1:64 and 1:120. At those scales, riflemen should be able to shoot each other from several meters away, which is longer than most game tables. If model soldiers could shoot each other from opposite ends of the table, without the need to maneuver, the game would be very monotonous. For example, the miniature wargame Bolt Action solves this problem by reducing a rifle's range to 24 inches, a sub-machine gun's range to 12 inches, and a pistol's range to 6 inches. Even if these ranges are not realistic, their proportions make intuitive sense (a rifle's range is longer than a sub-machine gun, due to the differing ammunitions) and thus preserve some verisimilitude, all the while compressing the battle to fit the confines of the table. Additionally, the ranges are multiples of 6, which makes them easier to remember.\n\nFog of war\nIn real warfare, commanders have incomplete information about their enemy and the battlespace. A wargame that conceals some information from the player is called a closed game. An open wargame has no secret information. Most recreational wargames are open wargames. A closed wargame can simulate the espionage and reconnaissance aspects of war.\nMilitary wargames often use referees to manage secret information. The players may be forced to sit in separate rooms, and communicate their orders with the referee in the game room, who in turn reports back only the information he judges the players should know. Some recreational wargames use a referee too, often referring to them as \"the GameMaster\" (e.g. Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader).\nThe fog of war is easy to simulate in a computer wargame, as a virtual environment is free of the physical constraints of a tabletop game. The computer itself can serve as the referee.\n\nTypes\nMiniature\nMiniature wargaming is a form of wargaming where units on the battlefield are represented by miniature models, as opposed to abstract pieces such as wooden blocks or plastic counters. Likewise, the battlefield itself is represented by model terrain, as opposed to a flat board or map; naval wargames are often played on a floor because they tend to require more space than a tabletop. Most miniature wargaming is recreational because issues of scale get in the way of realism.\nMiniature wargaming can be more expensive and time-consuming than other forms of wargaming. Furthermore, most manufacturers do not sell ready-to-play models, they sell boxes of model parts, which the players are expected to assemble and paint themselves. This requires skill, time, and money, but many players like the opportunity to show off their artistic skills. Miniature wargaming is often as much about artistry as it is about play.\n\nBoard\nA board wargame is played on a board that has a more-or-less fixed layout and is supplied by the game's manufacturer. This is in contrast to customizable playing fields made with modular components, such as in miniature wargaming.\n\nBlock\nIn block wargaming, the Fog of War is built into the game by representing units with upright wooden blocks that are marked on only one face, which is oriented towards the player who owns the block. The opponent cannot see the markings from his position. The first such block wargame was Quebec 1759 by Columbia Games (previously named Gamma Two Games), depicting the campaign surrounding the Battle of the Plains of Abraham.\n\nCard\nBecause of their nature, cards are well suited for abstract games, as opposed to the simulation aspects of wargames. Traditional card games are not considered wargames even when nominally about the same subject (such as the game War).\nAn early card wargame was Nuclear War, a 'tongue-in-cheek game of the end of the world', first published in 1966 and still published today by Flying Buffalo. It does not simulate how any actual nuclear exchange would happen, but it is still structured unlike most card games because of the way it deals with its subject.\nIn the late 1970s Battleline Publications (a board wargame company) produced two card games, Naval War and Armor Supremacy. The first was fairly popular in wargaming circles, and is a light system of naval combat, though again not depicting any 'real' situation (players may operate ships from opposing navies side-by-side). Armor Supremacy was not as successful, but is a look at the constant design and development of new types of tanks during World War II.\nThe most successful card wargame (as a card game and as a wargame) would almost certainly be Up Front, a card game about tactical combat in World War II published by Avalon Hill in 1983. The abstractness is harnessed in the game by having the deck produce random terrain, and chances to fire, and the like, simulating uncertainty as to the local conditions (nature of the terrain, etc.).\nDan Verssen Games is a specialist designer and publisher of card games for several genres, including air combat and World War II and modern land combat.\nAlso, card driven games (CDGs), first introduced in 1993, use a deck of (custom) cards to drive most elements of the game, such as unit movement (activation) and random events. These are, however, distinctly board games, the deck is merely one of the most important elements of the game.\n\nComputer\nThe term \"wargame\" is rarely used in the video gaming hobby; the term \"strategy game\" is preferred. \"Computer wargame\" distinguishes a game from a \"tabletop wargame\".\nComputer wargames have many advantages over traditional wargames. In a computer game, all the routine procedures and calculations are automated. The player needs only to make strategic and tactical decisions. The learning curve for the player is smaller, as the game can be played without mastering all its mechanics. The gameplay is faster, as a computer can process calculations much faster than a human. Computer wargames often have more sophisticated mechanics than traditional wargames thanks to automation. Computer games tend to be cheaper than traditional wargames because, being software, they can be copied and distributed very efficiently. It's easier for a player to find opponents with a computer game: a computer game can use artificial intelligence to provide a virtual opponent, or connect him to another human player over the Internet. For these reasons, computers are now the dominant medium for wargaming.\n\nComputer-assisted\nIn the recent years, programs have been developed for computer-assisted gaming as regards to wargaming. Two different categories can be distinguished: local computer assisted wargames and remote computer assisted wargames.\nLocal computer assisted wargames are mostly not designed toward recreating the battlefield inside computer memory, but employing the computer to play the role of game master by storing game rules and unit characteristics, tracking unit status and positions or distances, animating the game with sounds and voice and resolving combat. Flow of play is simple: each turn, the units come up in a random order. Therefore, the more units an opponent has, the more chance he will be selected for the next turn. When a unit comes up, the commander specifies an order and if offensive action is being taken, a target, along with details about distance. The results of the order, base move distance and effect to target, are reported, and the unit is moved on the tabletop. All distance relationships are tracked on the tabletop. All record-keeping is tracked by the computer.\nRemote computer assisted wargames can be considered as extensions to the concept of play-by-email gaming, however the presentation and actual capabilities are completely different. They have been designed to replicate the look and feel of existing board or miniatures wargames on the computer. The map and counters are presented to the user who can then manipulate these, more-or-less as if he were playing the physical game, and send a saved file off to his opponent, who can review what has been done without having to duplicate everything on his physical set-up of the game, and respond. Some allow for both players to get on-line and see each other's moves in real-time.\nThese systems are generally set up so that while one can play the game, the program has no knowledge of the rules, and cannot enforce them. The human players must have a knowledge of the rules themselves. The idea is to promote the playing of the games (by making play against a remote opponent easier), while supporting the industry (and reducing copyright issues) by ensuring that the players have access to the actual physical game.\nThe four main programs that can be used to play a number of games each are Aide de Camp, Cyberboard, Vassal and ZunTzu. Aide de Camp is available for purchase, while the other three are offered free. Vassal is in turn an outgrowth of the VASL (Virtual ASL) project, and uses Java, making it accessible to any computer that can run a modern JVM, while the other three are Microsoft Windows programs.\n\nPlay-by-mail (PBM)\nWargames were played remotely through the mail, with players sending lists of moves, or orders, to each other through the mail.\nIn some early PBM systems, six sided dice rolling was simulated by designating a specific stock and a future date and once that date passed, the players would determine an action's outcome using the sales in hundreds value for specific stocks on a specific date and then dividing the NYSE published sales in hundreds by six, using the remainder as the dice result.\nNuclear Destruction, by the Flying Buffalo, was an early PBM game in 1970. Origins Award Hall-of-Fame member Middle-Earth Play-By-Mail is still active today.\nReality Simulations, Inc. still runs a number of PBM games, such as Duel2 (formerly known as Duelmasters), Hyborian War, and Forgotten Realms: War of the Avatars.\n\nE-mail and traditional\nSince e-mail is faster than the standard postal service, the rise of the Internet saw a shift of people playing board wargames from play-by-mail (PBM) to play-by-email (PBEM) or play-by-web (PBW). The mechanics were the same, merely the medium was faster.\nAt this time, turn-based strategy computer games still had a decent amount of popularity, and many started explicitly supporting the sending of saved-game files through email (instead of needing to find the file to send to the opponent by hand). As with all types of video games, the rise in home networking solutions and Internet access has also meant that networked games are now common and easy to set up.\n\nHistory\nEarly Prussian wargames (1780–1806)\nThe first wargame was invented in Prussia in 1780 by Johann Christian Ludwig Hellwig. Hellwig's wargame was the first true wargame because it attempted to be realistic enough to teach useful lessons in military strategy to future army officers. Hellwig was a college professor and many of his students were aristocrats destined for military service. But Hellwig also wanted to sell his wargame commercially as a recreational item. Hellwig chose to base his game on chess so as to make it attractive and accessible to chess players. Hellwig published a second edition of his rulebook in 1803.\nAs in chess, Hellwig's game was played on a grid of squares, but it was a much larger grid, and the squares were color-coded to represent different types of terrain: mountains, swamp, water, trenches, etc. The layout of the terrain was not fixed, which allowed players to create their own custom battlefields. The pieces in the game represented real military units: cavalry, infantry, artillery, and various support units. As in chess, only a single piece could occupy a square, and the pieces moved square by square, either laterally or diagonally. Over normal terrain, infantry could move a maximum distance of eight squares, dragoons could move twelve squares, and light cavalry could move sixteen squares—intuitively mirroring the speed at which these units move in the real world. But terrain could impede movement: mountains were impassable, swamps slowed units down, rivers could only be crossed with the help of a special pontoon unit, etc. A player could only move one piece per turn, or one group of pieces if they were arranged in a rectangle. A piece could capture an enemy piece by moving into its square, just like in chess, but infantry and artillery pieces could also shoot enemy pieces, at a maximum ranges of two to three squares. Unlike chess, the pieces had orientation: for instance, an infantry piece could only shoot an enemy piece if they were facing it and flanking it. Hellwig's wargame could also simulate the fog of war to limited degree: while the players were arranging their pieces in their starting positions, they had the option of placing a screen across the board so that they could not observe their opponent's arrangement until the game started. Once the game was in progress, however, there was no hiding anything.\nHellwig's wargame was a commercial success, and inspired other inventors to develop their own chess-like wargames. In 1796, another Prussian named Johann Georg Julius Venturini invented his own wargame, inspired by Hellwig's game. Venturini's game was played on an even larger grid. Venturini's game also added rules governing logistics, such as supply convoys and mobile bakeries, and the effects of weather and seasons, making this perhaps the first operational-level wargame. In 1806, an Austrian named Johann Ferdinand Opiz developed a wargame aimed at both civilian and military markets. Like Hellwig's game, it used a modular grid-based board. But unlike Hellwig's game, Opiz's game used dice rolls to simulate the unpredictability of real warfare. This innovation was controversial at the time. Hellwig, who designed his wargame for both leisure as well as instruction, felt that introducing chance would spoil the fun.\nA criticism of the chess-like wargames of Hellwig, Venturini, and Opiz was that the pieces were constrained to move across a grid in chess-like fashion. Only a single piece could occupy a square, even if that square represented a square mile; and the pieces had to move square by square, their exact location within a square being immaterial. The grid also forced the terrain into unnatural forms, such as rivers that flowed in straight lines and bent at right angles. This lack of realism meant that no army took these wargames seriously.\n\nKriegsspiel (1824)\nIn 1824, a Prussian army officer named Georg Heinrich Rudolf Johann von Reisswitz presented to the Prussian General Staff a highly realistic wargame that he and his father had developed over the years. Instead of a chess-like grid, this game was played on accurate paper maps of the kind the Prussian army used. This allowed the game to model terrain naturally and better simulate battles in real locations. The pieces could be moved across the map in a free-form manner, subject to terrain obstacles. The pieces, each of which represented some kind of army unit (an infantry battalion, a cavalry squadron, etc.), were little rectangular blocks made of lead. The pieces were painted either red or blue to indicate the faction it belonged to. The blue pieces were used to represent the Prussian army and red was used to represent some foreign enemy—since then it has been the convention in military wargaming to use blue to represent the faction to which the players actually belong to. The game used dice to add a degree of randomness to combat. The scale of the map was 1:8000 and the pieces were made to the same proportions as the units they represented, such that each piece occupied the same relative space on the map as the corresponding unit did on the battlefield.\nThe game modeled the capabilities of the units realistically using data gathered by the Prussian army during the Napoleonic Wars. Reisswitz's manual provided tables that listed how far each unit type could move in a round according to the terrain it was crossing and whether it was marching, running, galloping, etc.; and accordingly the umpire used a ruler to move the pieces across the map. The game used dice to determine combat results and inflicted casualties, and the casualties inflicted by firearms and artillery decreased over distance. Unlike chess pieces, units in Reisswitz's game could suffer partial losses before being defeated, which were tracked on a sheet of paper (recreational gamers might call this \"hitpoint tracking\"). The game also had some rules that modeled morale and exhaustion.\nReisswitz's game also used an umpire. The players did not directly control the pieces on the game map. Rather, they wrote orders for their virtual troops on pieces of paper, which they submitted to the umpire. The umpire then moved the pieces across the game map according to how he judged the virtual troops would interpret and carry out their orders. When the troops engaged the enemy on the map, the umpire rolled the dice, computed the effects, and removed defeated units the from map. The umpire also managed secret information so as to simulate the fog of war. The umpire placed pieces on the map only for those units which he judged both sides could see. He kept a mental track of where the hidden units were, and only placed their pieces on the map when he judged they came into view of the enemy.\nEarlier wargames had fixed victory conditions, such as occupying the enemy's fortress. By contrast, Reisswitz's wargame was open-ended. The umpire decided what the victory conditions were, if there were to be any, and they typically resembled the goals an actual army in battle might aim for. The emphasis was on the experience of decision-making and strategic thinking, not on competition. As Reisswitz himself wrote: \"The winning or losing, in the sense of a card or board game, does not come into it.\"\nIn the English-speaking world, Reisswitz's wargame and its variants are called Kriegsspiel, which is the German word for \"wargame\".\nThe Prussian king and the General Staff officially endorsed Reisswitz's wargame, and by the end of the decade every German regiment had bought materials for it. This was thus the first wargame to be widely adopted by a military as a serious tool for training and research. Over the years, the Prussians developed new variations of Reisswitz's system to incorporate new technologies and doctrine.\n\nWorldwide spread\nPrussian wargaming attracted little attention outside Prussia until 1870, when Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War. Many credited Prussia's victory to its wargaming tradition. The Prussian army did not have any significant advantage in weaponry, numbers, or troop training, but it was the only army in the world that practiced wargaming. Civilians and military forces around the world now took a keen interest in the German military wargames, which foreigners referred to as Kriegsspiel (the German word for \"wargame\"). The first Kriegsspiel manual in English, based on the system of Wilhelm von Tschischwitz, was published in 1872 for the British army and received a royal endorsement. The world's first recreational wargaming club was the University Kriegspiel [sic] Club, founded in 1873 at Oxford University in England. In the United States, Charles Adiel Lewis Totten published Strategos, the American War Game in 1880, and William R. Livermore published The American Kriegsspiel in 1882, both heavily inspired by Prussian wargames. In 1894, the US Naval War College made wargaming a regular tool of instruction.\n\nMiniature wargaming\nThe English writer H. G. Wells developed codified rules for playing with toy soldiers, which he published in a book titled Little Wars (1913). This is widely remembered as the first rulebook for miniature wargaming (for terrestrial armies, at least). Little Wars had very simple rules to make it fun and accessible to anyone. Little Wars did not use dice or computation to resolve fights. For artillery attacks, players used spring-loaded toy cannons which fired little wooden cylinders to physically knock over enemy models. As for infantry and cavalry, they could only engage in hand-to-hand combat (even if the figurines exhibited firearms). When two infantry units fought in close quarters, the units would suffer non-random losses determined by their relative sizes. Little Wars was designed for a large field of play, such as a lawn or the floor of a large room. An infantryman could move up to one foot per turn, and a cavalryman could move up to two feet per turn. To measure these distances, players used a two-foot long piece of string. Wells was also the first wargamer to use scale models of buildings, trees, and other terrain features to create a three-dimensional battlefield.\nWells' rulebook, however, failed to invigorate the miniature wargaming community. A possible reason was the two World Wars, which de-glamorized war and caused shortages of tin and lead that made model soldiers expensive. Another reason may have been the lack of magazines or clubs dedicated to miniature wargames. Miniature wargaming was seen as a niche within the larger hobby of making and collecting model soldiers.\nIn 1955, a California man named Jack Scruby began making inexpensive miniature models for miniature wargames out of type metal. Scruby's major contribution to the miniature wargaming hobby was to network players across America. At the time, the miniature wargaming community was minuscule, and players struggled to find each other. In 1956, Scruby organized the first miniature wargaming convention in America, which was attended by just fourteen people. From 1957 to 1962, he self-published the world's first wargaming magazine, titled The War Game Digest, through which wargamers could publish their rules and share game reports. It had less than two hundred subscribers, but it did establish a steadily growing community.\nAround the same time in the United Kingdom, Donald Featherstone began writing an influential series of books on wargaming, which represented the first mainstream published contribution to wargaming since Little Wars. Titles included : War Games (1962), Advanced Wargames, Solo Wargaming, Wargame Campaigns, Battles with Model Tanks, Skirmish Wargaming. Such was the popularity of such titles that other authors were able to have published wargaming titles. This output of published wargaming titles from British authors coupled with the emergence at the same time of several manufacturers providing suitable wargame miniatures (e.g. Miniature Figurines, Hinchliffe, Peter Laing, Garrisson, Skytrex, Davco, Heroic & Ros) was responsible for the huge upsurge of popularity of the hobby in the late 1960s and into the 1970s.\nIn 1956, Tony Bath published what was the first ruleset for a miniature wargame set in the medieval period. These rules were a major inspiration for Gary Gygax's Chainmail (1971), which in turn became the basis for the roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons.\nFrom 1983 to 2015, Games Workshop produced what was the first miniature wargame designed to be used with proprietary models: Warhammer Fantasy. Earlier miniature wargames were designed to be played using generic models that could be bought from any manufacturer, but Warhammer Fantasy's setting featured original characters with distinctive visual designs, and their models were produced exclusively by Games Workshop.\n\nBoard wargaming (1954–present)\nThe first successful commercial board wargame was Tactics (1954) by an American named Charles S. Roberts. What distinguished this wargame from previous ones is that it was mass-produced and all the necessary materials for play were bundled together in a box. Previous wargames were often just a rulebook and required players to obtain the other materials themselves. The game was played on a pre-fabricated board with a fixed layout, which is why it was called a board game.\nRoberts later founded the Avalon Hill Game Company, the first firm that specialized in commercial wargames. In 1958, Avalon Hill released Gettysburg, which was a retooling of the rules of Tactics, and was based on the historical Battle of Gettysburg. Gettysburg became the most widely-played wargame yet.\nBoard wargames were more popular than miniature wargames. One reason was that assembling a playset for miniature wargaming was expensive, time-consuming, and require artisanal skill. Another reason was that board wargames could be played by correspondence. Board wargames were usually grid-based, or else designed in some way that moves could be explained in writing in simple terms. This was not possible with the free-form nature of miniature wargames.\n\nNotable people\nWargaming as a hobby\nGeorg von Reisswitz, who with his father invented Kriegsspiel.\nH.G.

The very first tactical wargame. The game pioneered the use of \"geomorphic mapboards\" and PanzerBlitz was a game system rather than just a game in that forces could be used to depict any number of actual tactical situations rather than one specific scenario. Pioneered several ground-breaking features, such as use of various types of weapons fire to reflect battlefield conditions. Also created new level of realism in reflecting tactical armored vehicles.\nQuebec 1759 (Columbia Games, 1972) – The first wargame to use wooden blocks with labels to provide a fog of war and four possible steps of strength.\nSniper! (SPI, 1973) – along with Patrol, the first Man to Man wargames where game pieces depicted a single soldier. An adaptation of Sniper! also became one of the first multi-player computer wargames.\nWooden Ships and Iron Men (Battleline Publications, 1974 Avalon Hill, 1976) – the definitive game of Age of Sail warfare for many years.\nRise and Decline of the Third Reich (Avalon Hill, 1974) – The first serious attempt to model World War II in Europe in its entirety, including (in a limited way) the economic and industrial production of the nations involved. It has seen numerous versions and editions, and is currently available as John Prados' Third Reich from Avalanche Press, and as a far more complex descendant game, A World At War, published by GMT Games.\nLa Bataille de la Moskowa (Martial Enterprises, 1974) Later republished by Games Designers Workshop and Clash of Arms. With 4 maps and 1000+ counters, it is credited with being the first \"monster\" wargame (by famed designer Richard Berg.)\nSPQR (GMT Games, 1992)\nSquad Leader (Avalon Hill, 1977) and Advanced Squad Leader (1985) have become the most prolific series of wargames, including 3 add-on modules for the former, and 12 for the latter, with additional Historical modules and Deluxe modules also having been released. ASL also sets the record for sheer volume of playing components, with thousands of official counters and 60+ \"geomorphic mapboards\" not counting Deluxe and Historical maps.\nStar Fleet Battles – (Task Force Games, 1978) one of the older still actively played and published wargames today; based on Star Trek, it is arguably the most successful tactical space combat system that does not rely on miniatures (published by Amarillo Design Bureau).\nStorm Over Arnhem (Avalon Hill, 1981) – pioneered the use of \"point to point\" or \"area movement\" in tactical wargames.\nAxis and Allies – (Nova Games, 1981) the most successful of Milton Bradley's (1984) 'GameMaster' line in an attempt to bring wargaming into the mainstream by appealing to non-wargamers through simplicity and attractive components.\nAmbush! – (Victory Games, 1983) the first solitaire board wargame depicting man to man combat, in which each game piece represented a single person.\nBlue Max – (GDW, 1983) is a multi-player game of World War I aerial combat over the Western Front during 1917 and 1918 with an extremely easy to play mechanism but allow the development of complex strategies.\nWe the People – (Avalon Hill, 1994) this game started the Card-Driven wargame movement, which is very influential in current wargame design.\n\nMiniature\nRules for the Jane Naval War Game (S. Low, Marston, 1898) – The first published miniature wargame. A 26-page rule set limited to naval miniature battles. It came in a crate measuring 4 ft. X 4 ft. X 2 ft. Written by Fred Jane. As only a handful of these games survive, they are highly collectible.\nLittle Wars (H.G. Wells, 1913) – The first popular published wargame rules. Includes the common miniature wargaming mechanics of dice rolling, range, line of sight, and moving in alternate turns. This game earned Wells the title \"The Father of Miniature Wargaming\".\nMiniature Wargames du temps de Napoleon (John C. Candler, 1964) – First period-specific historical miniature wargame. Also the first in a long line of Napoleonic miniature wargames.\nChainmail (Guidon Games, 1971) – An extension and distillation of rules previously published in various periodicals. While mostly about historical medieval combat, it had an addendum that covered fantasy elements. Major elements of this game were adopted by the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. Unlike Dungeons & Dragons, Chainmail used two six-sided dice to resolve combat. Previous fantasy miniature wargames had been written, but this was the first one published. Drawing on the popularity of The Lord of the Rings, this game featured the novelties of combat magic and fantastic creatures as combatants.\nWarhammer Fantasy Battle (Games Workshop, 1983) – An internationally successful fantasy miniature wargame. The First Edition rules introduced innovative open unit design rules, however later editions eliminated the option to build custom units and make use of standard army lists mandatory. Warhammer was one of the first newly developed miniature wargames to enjoy popularity after role-playing games came to market in 1974. In fact, it is because of Roleplaying games becoming so popular, and people having too many models that were rarely used, that this was first published.\nWarhammer 40,000 (Games Workshop, 1987) – A futuristic wargame featuring rival armies with different fighting styles. This wargame has very conceptual artwork suggesting a post-apocalyptic neo-gothic universe with heavy dystopic themes. Unarguably the most profitable miniature wargame ever , it has popularized competitive tournament gameplay in large, international events sanctioned by Games Workshop.\nDe Bellis Antiquitatis (Wargames Research Group, 1990) – Radically minimalist rules differentiate this game from other notable miniature wargames. A number of systems have been strongly influenced by DBA.\nMage Knight (WizKids Inc., 2001) – Innovative game popularizing the combat dial, pre-painted plastic miniatures, and the collectible miniatures games. Mage Knight has inspired numerous collectible, skirmish miniature wargames.\nWarmachine (Privateer Press, 2003) – A steampunk-inspired miniatures game featuring steam-powered robots fighting under the direction of powerful wizards. Also has a sister game, Hordes, which features large monstrous creatures in the place of robots.\nHeroscape (Milton Bradley Company, 2004) – An inexpensive, simple wargame that has been successfully mass marketed to both younger wargamers and adults. As miniature wargaming is often an expensive hobby, Heroscape and the collectible miniatures games have opened the miniature wargaming hobby to a new demographic.\nInfinity (Corvus Belli, 2005) is a tabletop wargame in which sci-fi themed with 28mm scale metal miniatures are used to simulate futuristic skirmishes.\nBrikWars is a wargame that uses Lego bricks as miniatures and scenery and gained popularity mostly due to the looseness of the rules.\nFlames of War (Battlefront Miniatures, 2002) – Popular World War II wargame at 15mm (1:100) scale, currently focusing on the European and Mediterean theatres. Splits into three time periods (Early War 1939–41, Mid War 1942–43 and Late War 1944–45) to bring some balance and historical matchups.\nMalifaux\nSee also List of miniature wargames.\n\nComputer\nWars – (Nintendo and Intelligent Systems, with Kuju Entertainment) – a series of turn-based wargames released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, GameCube, Wii, DS and Switch, respectively, featuring a cartoony aesthetic and grid based gameplay. Intelligent Systems would subsequently adapt the traditional wargaming formula into the popular Fire Emblem series of tactical role-playing video games.\nPanzer General – (Strategic Simulations, Inc., 1994) – probably the most widely popular computer game that is recognizably a traditional wargame. It spawned several sequels, some of which explored different subject matter.\nSteel Panthers – (Strategic Simulations, Inc., 1995) – an early tactical wargame on the same scale as Squad Leader, which led to two sequels, and a complete revision of the title for free release.\nClose Combat – (Microsoft, 1996) – not the first wargame to break out from hexes, and still presented in a 2-dimensional format, Close Combat nonetheless uniquely addressed factors such as individual morale and reluctance to carry out orders. The original title led to 5 very successful sequels for the general public, as well as being developed into a training tool for military use only. Close Combat stemmed from an early attempt to translate the Squad Leader boardgame to the computer.\nCombat Mission – (Big Time Software, 2000) – not the first 3D tactical wargame (titles such as Muzzle Velocity preceded it), but a groundbreaking game series featuring simultaneous order resolution, complete orders of battle for numerous nationalities, with three titles based on the original game engine. As of 2006, a campaign layer is in testing as well as a revised game engine to be released before 2007. CM's genesis was also as a failed attempt by Avalon Hill to translate Squad Leader to the computer.\nTacOps – (Major I. L. Holdridge, 2003 for v4) – commercial version of “TacOpsCav 4”, an officially issued standard training device of the US Army. It is a simulation of contemporary and near-future tactical, ground, combat between the modern armed forces of the world.\nWargame: Red Dragon – (Eugen Systems, 2014) – a 3D regiment or brigade scale simulation set as a \"Cold War Gone Hot\" themed game in both multiplayer and singleplayer environments. Players construct customized armies through use of a deck system comprising land vehicles, infantry, and helicopters from several NATO and Warsaw Pact nations and manage logistics such as fuel and ammunition while on the battlefield. There is no cohesive campaign, the game instead taking place in several hypothetical conflicts.\nTotal War – a wargame set in different time periods, with a turn based map, and a real time battle component, featured on the television series Time Commanders\nHearts of Iron – (Paradox Interactive, 2002) − a grand strategy wargame series that is focused on World War 2. Player may act as any reasonably sized nation at the time, influencing international politics, economic and military development, and can control battlefields on both strategic and operational levels using combined arms. Frequently used to entertain and simulate alternative history scenarios as well as recreate historical events.\nHegemony – (Longbow Games) – a historical real-time strategy series with real-time tactical combat and supply simulation. Campaigning takes place on a single continuous map where players can zoom between the 3D tactical map and the 2D strategy map at any time.\nCommand: Modern Operations – (Warfare Sims, 2019) a piece of professional multiplayer wargaming software that is also sold on the commercial market as a single player product. Its primary focus is on allowing the simulation of operational or tactical level real world combat scenarios with real time input. The commercial version comes bundled with some scenarios (in addition to those sold as DLC), however the software's primary focus is the ability to create share one's own scenarios. The creation of a strategic level wargame is possible in the commercial version, however no such scenario has been bundled with the software. Its level of fidelity is represented down to the individual vehicle/infantry squad and it utilizes a regularly updated database of weapons, vehicles, satellites, and equipment used by nearly every nation on the planet from the end of World War 2 to the near future (including some hypothetical entries). Gameplay is a top down 2D map of the Earth, however you can stream your gameplay to Tacview for a 3D view.\n\nUnique game systems\nAce of Aces – (Nova Games, 1980) – this flip-book system is a simulation of aerial dogfighting.\nBattleTech – (FASA, 1984) – initially conceived as a board game, it has created a brand that now includes various different boardgames (tactical as well as strategic), miniature game rules, a role-playing game, computer games, flip-book games (by Nova Games) as well as novels and a TV series.\nCar Wars – (Steve Jackson Games, 1982) – initially printed as a board game, it quickly evolved to incorporate elements of miniatures games.\nUp Front – (Avalon Hill, 1983) – A popular card wargame.\n\nSee also\nAir wargaming\nNaval wargaming\nMiniature wargaming\nTactical wargame\nBusiness war games\nInternational Wargames Federation\nList of wargame publishers\n\nFootnotes\nBibliography\nMatthew B.

        "content": "Kadhalar Dhinam ( transl. Lovers Day) is a 1999 Indian Tamil-language romance film written and directed by Kathir. The film stars Kunal and Sonali Bendre in the lead roles, while Nassar, Manivannan, Goundamani and Chinni Jayanth appear in supporting roles. It is based on a love relationship which begins through an internet chatroom and takes a turn after the protagonist has second thoughts about the relationship after finding out his lover's true identity.\nKadhalar Dhinam is the debut film for Kunal, and first major role for Bendre in Tamil. The film, produced by A. M. Rathnam, had music composed by A. R. Rahman, cinematography by P. C. Sreeram and editing by B. Lenin and V. T. Vijayan. It was released on 9 July 1999, while a partially reshot but mostly dubbed Hindi version, Dil Hi Dil Mein was released on 21 April 2000. The film received positive reviews and was a commercial success. It was also dubbed in Telugu as Premikula Roju.\n\nPlot\nRaja is from a very poor, illiterate family, from Tamil Nadu. People from his region consider that education is meant only for the rich. There, poor boys are made to work from age five, either at factories or farms, so that they can support their families. Raja's dad is a violent alcoholic. He spends half of the family's income on alcohol. Raja's family struggles to survive hard every day. But, Raja's mother forced his father to let Raja finish high school, without doing any other work. But he refuses to fund him, and orders him to start work as accountant for their landlord. Raja's mother begs him to move to Mumbai to start a new life. Raja heeds his mother's pleas and moves to Mumbai to attend under graduate entrance exam at Ramachandra Institute of Management Studies, the top-most premier b-school in India.\nThe film starts at a train station on New Year Day, 1999. Raja talks with a manager / veteran colonel named Manivannan in the station. Due to insistence, Raja goes into a flashback. Three years ago, he reaches Mumbai, where he plans to get admitted into the prestigious Ramachandra College of management, one of the most premier institutes in the nation. He gains admission for an MBA program at the Ramachandra College in Mumbai, though he was in 41st rank, in admission tests, for the 40 member class, courtesy of the college chairman, Dr. Ramachandra, but he does not realise this at first. He thinks that he managed to get a seat due to his own abilities. This was because Ramachandra saw Raja sleeping on the same enclave-side bench, where he had slept without having anything else than the thought of providing quality education to all, 40 years ago. Ramachandra was born to a poor illiterate family and his father abandoned them after his sister's birth. Out of his desire to become a student, his mother rents the baby sister for beggars, to pay fees. But the poor baby dies and this pushes Ramachandra to create the best institute in India, by hard work. He brings up his daughter, in a humble manner, all alone after the death of his wife.\nRaja meets Roja through the Internet. After a brief introduction, Raja and Roja started loving each other. They have yet to see each other and thus, they sent their pictures through e-mail to each other. As Roja checks her e-mail and sees Raja's photo, Raja enters the Net Cafe where Roja was. Then, they meet each other. They are initially shocked by seeing each other as Roja told him that she is in America and Raja told her that he is in London, although they were both in India and were studying in the same college.\nThe very next day, Raja meets Roja again in the train station where he usually comes to board the train. Again they are both surprised and were speechless when they saw each other. However, things take a turn for the bad when they are both unable to express their feelings about each other due to fated accidents. Raja wanted to see if Roja really likes him by asking her to wear a rose on her head. But, as she walks towards the train station, her rose drops off. Unaware of this, Raja believes that Roja really does not like him. Ramachandra meets him and tells him to be practical. He suggests that Raja should write her a love letter. As Raja does not know how to write one, Ramachandra helps him. Even his daughter, Roja, helps him write a letter for Raja, unaware that it was for Raja that the father was writing it.\nThe next day, Raja meets her in the train station and gives her his books, with the love letter inside of it. Not knowing why he gave her his books, she just skims through his books, accidentally causing his love letter to fly away. However, Roja does write a love letter to him too. As she returns his books, a long-lost friend of Raja meets him on the train station. Raja writes the address on the first page of the book and tears it off to give to his friend. Unfortunately, he was not aware that Roja wrote her love letter right behind it. He feels disappointed and does not show interest to Roja, causing her to think that he does not like her. Ramachandra comes to the rescue again and asks Raja to write another love letter and give it to her the next day, which happens to be Lovers Day. When Raja comes to express his love for Roja, he finds out that Roja is the daughter of Ramachandra, who has decided to fix his daughter up with Rajesh Gupta, a smart and wealthy golf player who completed his MBA degree in America. Rajesh's father owns the second best private university in India and wants to merge his with Ramachandra's. Roja makes a last attempt to find out if Raja likes her or not. She sends him an e-mail stating that she loves him. On the other hand, Raja does not want to hurt the feelings of his beloved guide and teacher, whom he respects as his father. Thus, he sends her an e-mail stating that he is unable to return his feelings for Roja. Roja begrudgingly agrees to the wedding, assuming that Raja will never fall in love with her.\nRaja comes to the wedding, but leaves the hall to go back to his hometown, which goes back to the beginning of the film. Coincidentally, Ramachandra overhears his conversation between Raja and his friends and realises that he is in love with his daughter. He goes to the train station to stop Raja, asking him to return and propose to Roja. Raja and Ramachandra reach the wedding hall on time. But as they make their way, Roja faints due to ingesting poison in a suicide attempt. Raja comes and rescues Roja and she is saved.\nRaja and Roja are married on 1999’s Lovers Day, and the film ends with showing them marrying.\n\nCast\nHindi version\n\nProduction\nKathir, being an inveterate surfer of the cybercafes of Chennai and Bangalore, decided to make a film on what he felt the internet could develop and be used for – romance. He initially titled the film as Lovers Day and began pre-production work in 1997, before giving the project a Tamil title, Kadhalar Dhinam. Kathir got to visit a newly opened cyber cafe in Bangalore and the \"way that picture downloaded, slowly, frame by frame, was mind-blowing. Something struck me and I rushed out to write the basic one-liner of Kadhalar Dhinam\". Since producer A. M. Rathnam was not aware of the internet, Kathir created a comedy track including Goundamani \"to make it reach audiences\". Goundamani's character, including his hairstyle, were inspired by Leonardo DiCaprio's character Jack from Titanic (1997).\nShaam was amongst the auditionees for the debut lead role, before Kunal Singh was selected after Kathir spotted him outside a Bangalore cybercafe. The Pune-based Singh had been in Bangalore only to bulk up his body before joining the army, but with the offer chose to make a career in films. Kathir had scouted for a non-Tamil actress to play the female lead and subsequently Bollywood actress Sonali Bendre was signed on to play Kunal's lover in the film, making her major debut in Tamil films. Isha Koppikar had also been considered for the film, but after finalising Bendre, Kathir then recommended her to his friend K. S. Ravi to cast her in his En Swasa Kaatre (1999). For the launch of the film, the makers flew in models Lara Dutta, Laila Rouass and Rani Jeyraj to attend the launch event of the film. Rambha appeared in an item number in the film. For a song sequence, red rose petals were used to cover the forecourt of the Taj Mahal in Agra.\nFor the Hindi dubbed version Dil Hi Dil Mein, Kathir reshot scenes featuring Singh and Anupam Kher to replace the Singh-Manivannan tracks by conversing in Hindi while Johnny Lever's scenes replaced the Goundamani tracks (even though he appeared briefly for the \"Chand Aaya Hai\" song) with the same Titanic hairstyle. Chinni Jayanth's part was portrayed by Raju Shreshta in Hindi; however scenes involving Singh and Chinni Jayanth in Tamil were dubbed in Hindi. Even the tracks dubbed from the Tamil version were reshot with Hindi synchronisation sans for the first line of \"Roja Roja\". Actor Nassar, though dubbed in Hindi, had given his Hindi synching in the song \"Sawar Gayee\". Though Singh and Bendre had synched their dialogues in Hindi, the rest of the film was dubbed.\n\nSoundtrack\nRelease and reception\nKadhalar Dhinam was released on 9 July 1999. The film initially featured a different climax where Roja dies after taking tablets, but after release, the film was altered to give a happy ending. K. N. Vijiyan of New Straits Times wrote, \"This is a good movie for lovers and those who just want to pass time. Net-surfers will find the goings-on interesting\". K. P. S. of Kalki wrote that Kathir gave \"www touch\" to the same old love story of Tamil cinema, and music and cinematography makes this old story look like a new film. D. S. Ramanujam of The Hindu wrote, \"A team of highly qualified technicians such as music director, A. R. [Rahman], cinematographer P. C. [Sreeram], art director Thota Tharani and editors Lenin and V. T. Vijayan has contributed largely to give gloss to director Kathir's screenplay\".\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nKadhalar Dhinam at IMDb\nKadhalar Dhinam at Rotten Tomatoes\nDil Hi Dil Mein at IMDb\nDil Hi Dil Mein at Rotten Tomatoes"

        "content": "Romeo Alexander Challenger (born 19 May 1950) is an Antiguan-born English musician. He has been the drummer for the rock band Showaddywaddy since 1973 and seminal progressive rock band Black Widow.\nBorn in the British Leeward Islands, Romeo Alexander Challenger moved to the United Kingdom as an infant. In 1962, he was taught how to play the drums and after a stint in the satanic group Black Widow left to join Choise who in 1973 met The Golden Hammers and became Showaddywaddy. \nChallenger has played on every Showaddywaddy hit, and was one of two drummers with Malcolm Allured. Challenger also plays the timpani on songs. As of January 2019, Challenger is now the only original member of Showaddywaddy still touring, although not the only original member still involved, as lead singer Dave Bartram now manages the band.\n\nEarly life\nChallenger was born 19 May 1950 in St. John's, Antigua, British Leeward Islands. He is the second youngest original member of Showaddywaddy. \nIn 1955, he moved with his family to England. He began playing the drums in 1962. His first drum kit was £12, which he bought after taking a paper route. Challenger grew up in a household that listened to jazz artists such as Fats Domino. Challenger bought his first record, \"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\" by Small Faces, in 1965.\nChallenger played in the Leicester Boys' football team with Peter Shilton and Jeff Blockley, who both went on to enjoy professional careers.\nThe first band Challenger saw live was The Farinas, that had Roger Chapman on lead vocals. The Farinas' drummer, Harry Overnall, agreed to give Romeo drumming lessons.\n\nCareer\nHe played in several groups, including progressive  rock/hard rock band Black Widow in the early 1970s. They were an early example of satanic imagery. Challenger played drums, bongos and congas on two Black Widow albums, \"Black Widow\" and \"Black Widow III\". Challenger also wrote songs for the band, including Black Widow's opening track, \"Tears & Wine\". In October 1972, he left Black Widow and replaced Richard Hough in the cover band Choise, which also had Dave Bartram (vocals), Trevor Oakes (guitar), and Al James (bass). \nIn 1973, Choise and another band, The Golden Hammers, came together to become one eight-member band. Challenger became one of two drummers (The other being Malcolm Allured) for the rock and roll band Showaddywaddy. Showaddywaddy had ten singles reach the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, including the 1976 number-one \"Under the Moon of Love\".\nShowaddywaddy had ten top 10s and one number one in the UK between 1974 and 1982.  Challenger also plays the timpani, but only when playing \"Under the Moon of Love\". Challenger's deep voice can be heard singing on songs such as \"Under the Moon of Love\", \"Three Steps to Heaven\", and \"When\".\nChallenger is the only of the original eight members of Showaddywaddy who still tours in the current version of the band, since bassist Rod Deas retired in January 2019.\n\nPersonal life\nChallenger and his wife Dawn live in Leicestershire.\nChallenger is the father of high jumper Ben Challenger, who won a silver medal in the 1998 Commonwealth Games, and a bronze medal four years later; and Tamzin Challenger, a musician best known for her material with bassline producer T2.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nRomeo Challenger discography at MusicBrainz\nRomeo Challenger's biography at Showaddywaddy website"

        "content": "John Clarke Young (August 12, 1803 – June 23, 1857) was an American educator and pastor who was the fourth president of Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. A graduate of Dickinson College and Princeton Theological Seminary, he entered the ministry in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1828. He accepted the presidency of Centre College in 1830, holding the position until his death in 1857, making him the longest-serving president in the college's history. He is regarded as one of the college's best presidents, as he increased the endowment of the college more than five-fold during his term and increased the graduating class size from two students in his first year to forty-seven in his final year.\nContinuing to preach while in office, Young accepted the pastorate of the Danville Presbyterian Church in 1834 and founded the Second Presbyterian Church in Danville in 1852. He was a respected member of the church and was elected moderator of the Presbyterian Church's General Assembly in 1853. He published several sermons and speeches as part of this work, including one about temperance and several in support of the gradual emancipation of slaves.\nYoung is the namesake of several facets of the college today, including Young Hall and the John C. Young Scholars Program. He was the father of William C. Young, who later became Centre's eighth president.\n\nEarly life and education\nYoung was born on August 12, 1803, in Greencastle, Pennsylvania, to the Rev. John Young and Mary Clarke Young. He was the youngest child and an only son. As his father died while John was still an infant, he was raised almost entirely by his mother and educated at home by his grandfather, George Clark.\nHe moved to New York City to study at a classical school under John Borland, described as an \"eminent teacher in the city of New York\", before going to college. His uncle, the seven-term U.S. House Clerk Matthew St. Clair Clarke, offered to mentor him in a law-based profession, but he declined and decided to follow his father into the ministry. Young enrolled at Columbia College (now Columbia University), where he spent three years. He eventually transferred to Dickinson College in his native Pennsylvania, and he graduated with honors in 1823. He spent two years after graduation in New York, teaching algebra at the classical school he attended for the first and serving as an assistant to the professor of mathematics at Columbia for the second. In 1825, he enrolled at Princeton Theological Seminary, where he spent three years studying theology, specifically the interpretation of the Bible based upon the principles of Scottish common sense realism. He also tutored students at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). He graduated from Princeton Theological Seminary with a Doctor of Divinity degree in 1828.\n\nCareer\nEarly career and inauguration\nAfter he received a license to preach from the Presbytery of New York on March 7, 1827, Young's career in the ministry began following his graduation from Princeton. In 1828, he moved to Lexington, Kentucky, where he was appointed to the pastorate of McChord Presbyterian Church (now Second Presbyterian Church), founded in 1815 by James McChord, who was later elected as the first president of Centre College in Danville, Kentucky.\n\nCentre's presidency became vacant in October 1830 when Gideon Blackburn resigned the office, At the recommendation of Archibald Alexander, principal of Princeton Theological Seminary, the college's trustees offered Young the position in a unanimous vote. He accepted and was inaugurated as the fourth president of Centre College on November 18, 1830, at the age of 27.\n\nPresident of Centre College\nYoung inherited a college described by a Centre historian as \"small and poor\"; it was one which had graduated just 24 or 25 students over the course of its eleven-year history. His primary duty as president was raising funds, which the college desperately needed. Early in his presidency, he went to New York in an attempt to do so, and was successful in raising $6,000 (equivalent to $171,675 in 2023) to sponsor two new professors. He also succeeded in raising money from residents of Danville and other parts of Kentucky. He served on the college faculty as a professor of logic and moral philosophy, and taught belles-lettres and political economy when those positions were unfilled. After the conclusion of his first academic year as president, he delivered the commencement address to the senior class on September 22, 1831.\nThe curriculum during Young's tenure consisted of classics, mathematics, natural science and history, \"taught within a Christian framework\". The college catalogue from 1866 notes that each day of classes began with the \"worship of God\" and that religious instruction and sermons, held on the first Monday of each week, were required for all students. He became concerned with the behavior of the students as his tenure progressed; in an 1845 report to the Board of Trustees, he made note of the increased rate of drunkenness among the students and noted \"[the College] has been in a worse condition in respect to good order than it has ever been since I have been connected with it\". While a member of Centre's faculty, he was elected to membership of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity; this practice of electing members of a college's board of trustees or faculty was relatively common in the fraternity at the time. Centre graduated a fair proportion of its first notable alumni during his time in office; the class of 1855 alone consisted of John Y. Brown, Thomas Theodore Crittenden, Boyd Winchester, and William Campbell Preston Breckinridge. Other graduates during his term included John C. Breckinridge (1838), John Christian Bullitt (1849), John Marshall Harlan (1850), and Andrew Phelps McCormick (1854).\n\nMinistry and involvement with the Presbyterian Church\nIn 1834 Young became the pastor of the Danville Presbyterian Church, which served students and the town at large. He was popular with his congregation, which grew in size rapidly. A few years later, the Presbyterian Church found itself embroiled in the Old School–New School controversy, an 1837 schism that split the church into \"Old School\" traditional Calvinist theological conservatives and \"New School\" revivalists. He was a part of the \"Old School\", as were the Synod of Kentucky, many other southern synods, and both of Danville's Presbyterian Churches at which he had preached. Around this time he was offered the presidency at Transylvania University due to his successes in Danville, though he ultimately opted to stay at Centre. In 1852, the congregation had outgrown the building, and he founded a second church, the Second Presbyterian Church, to accommodate the many students that attended. The church remained operational until 1969, when the building was vacated and the congregations joined at the original First Presbyterian Church.\nYoung was among the delegates from the Synod of Kentucky to the 1853 General Assembly of the \"Old School\" Presbyterian Church, held in Philadelphia. On May 20, 1853, the second day of the meeting, he was elected to the office of moderator, earning the bare minimum number of votes necessary for a majority, 126 out of an available 251, and winning election on the first ballot. Commenting on his performance as moderator, a correspondent from The New York Times noted that he was \"of decided ability\". On May 23, he and the other delegates from the Synod of Kentucky petitioned the General Assembly for $60,000 (equivalent to $2,197,440 in 2023) to be put towards land and trusts to build a \"Seminary of the first class\" in \"the West\", with a plot of \"ten or more acres\" in Danville being named as a specific location. This seminary opened in Old Centre in 1853 as the Danville Theological Seminary, and moved to downtown Danville, in Constitution Square, the following year.\n\nPersonal life and death\nYoung married Frances Breckinridge, the sister of Centre graduate and later Vice President John C. Breckinridge, on November 3, 1829. The couple had four daughters between 1831 and 1837. After Frances' death on November 2, 1837, Young remarried to Cornelia Crittenden, the daughter of Governor John J. Crittenden, in 1839. The pair remained married until his death. The couple had six children between 1841 and 1849, including William C. Young, who graduated from Centre in 1859 and became Centre's eighth president in 1888.\nYoung suffered from poor health for the last several years of his life. Upon arriving at Centre in 1854, future college president William L. Breckinridge said in a letter to his father, \"Dr. Young looks badly – the rest look well\". Young died on June 23, 1857, at the age of 53. The cause of death was ultimately determined to have been stomach disease, which led to a hemorrhage. At the time of his death, he still held the presidency of the college. At his funeral, Robert Jefferson Breckinridge delivered the eulogy. Young was buried at Bellevue Cemetery in Danville; his son, William, was eventually buried next to him. His successor to the presidency was the Rev. Lewis W. Green, who was a faculty member for much of Young's time at the college. Green was elected to the position in August 1857 and began his term as president on January 1, 1858.\nAt the time of his death, Young was working on The Efficacy of Prayer, a treatise described by The Evangelical Repository as \"worthy of the subject and the author\". The work was published posthumously by the Presbyterian Board of Publishing. Young had given and published many speeches, essays, and sermons over the course of his life, including a speech about temperance, a speech at the inauguration of the professors at the Danville Theological Seminary, and a sermon entitled \"On the Sinfulness, Folly and Danger of Delay\".\nYoung was a proponent of the gradual emancipation of slaves, and gave several speeches advocating for it as a more moderate and reasonable alternative to immediate abolitionism; he also debated this subject at speaking engagements in Danville, Harrodsburg, and Garrard County with persons including the Presbyterian lawyer George Blackburn Kincaid and president James Shannon of Bacon College. Young was a slaveholder himself, and freed some of his own slaves on two separate occasions. Young was a member of an 1835 committee that determined the Synod's position in support of gradual emancipation, and Young himself also supported the colonization of former slaves in Africa; four black members of his congregation emigrated to Liberia under this plan in the early 1850s. He gave multiple speeches on this subject as well, including his Address to the Presbyterians of Kentucky, proposing a Plan for the Instruction and Emancipation of their Slaves (1834) and The Doctrine of Immediate Emancipation Unsound (1835), and proposed the addition of a clause providing for gradual emancipation in the new state constitution in 1849.\n\nLegacy\nAmong the aspects of Centre College named in honor of Young is Young Memorial Hall, named for John and William, which was dedicated on January 8, 1909, and was the college's first building devoted entirely to science. This building was destroyed in a fire several days before its scheduled demolition, and was replaced by a new Young Hall, which was dedicated on March 21, 1970. The new building underwent renovations and a large addition was dedicated on October 21, 2011. The John C. Young Scholars program at Centre, founded in 1989 as the John C. Young honors program, also bears his name, as does the John C. Young Symposium, where the aforementioned scholars present research and projects which they worked on as a part of the program.\nRegarded by many Centre historians as one of the college's best presidents, Young and his administration had a lasting effect on the college. During the course of his term, which lasted nearly 27 years, the college's endowment grew to over $100,000 (equivalent to $3,270,000 in 2023), representing more than a five-fold increase, and the enrollment exceeded 250 students. Young's final graduating class, the class of 1857, boasted 47 members, which was Centre's largest-ever class at the time; this was a significant increase over the graduating class of two students which Centre produced in Young's first year in office. Young's nearly 27-year term remains as the longest of any president in Centre's history, exceeding the terms of Thomas A. Spragens, who served for 24 years from 1957 to 1981, and John A. Roush, who served for 22 years between 1998 and 2020.\n\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nCooper, Joseph T. (June 1857). The Evangelical Repository. Vol. XVI. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: W.S.

        "content": "Denis Nowell Pritt, QC (22 September 1887 – 23 May 1972) was a British barrister and left-wing Labour Party politician. Born in Harlesden, Middlesex, he was educated at Winchester College and the University of London.\nA member of the Labour Party from 1918, he was a defender of the Soviet Union. In 1932, as part of G. D. H. Cole's New Fabian Research Bureau's expert commission of enquiry, he visited the Soviet Union, and, according to Margaret Cole, \"the eminent KC swallowed it all\". Pritt was expelled from the Labour Party in March 1940 following his support of the Soviet invasion of Finland.\nPritt was characterised by George Orwell as \"perhaps the most effective pro-Soviet publicist in this country\".\n\nEarly life\nPritt was born 22 September 1887 in London, the son of a metal merchant. He was educated at Winchester College, which he left after four years so as to relocate to Geneva in order to learn French, with a view to joining his father's company. Following his time in Switzerland, Pritt moved again to expand his linguistic knowledge, working in a bank in A Coruña, Spain, and improving his Spanish. Pritt also added German to his repertoire of languages in subsequent years.\nPritt was admitted to the Middle Temple on 1 May 1906 and was called to the bar on 17 November 1909. He continued to study law in 1909, obtaining a law degree from the University of London in 1910. He began his legal practice as a specialist in workmen's compensation cases.\nHe married in July 1914, on the eve of the First World War. During the war, he joined the postal censorship department in the British War Office. Following the war, Pritt returned to legal practice as a successful lawyer working in the field of commercial law.\n\nPolitical career\nA Conservative in his earliest years, Pritt moved steadily leftward politically, joining the Liberal Party in 1914 and the Labour Party in 1918. Following a failed 1931 campaign for Parliament as a Labour candidate in Sunderland, Pritt was elected as a Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Hammersmith North in 1935. Pritt was made a member of the Labour Party's executive committee in 1936, remaining in that role for over a year.\nIn 1936, he attended the first Moscow Show Trial, known as the Trial of the Sixteen. He wrote an account of this, The Zinoviev Trial, which largely supported Joseph Stalin and his first purge of the Communist Party.\nIn 1940, Pritt was expelled from the Labour Party for defending the Soviet invasion of Finland. His book Must the War Spread? sympathized with the Soviets and led him to be greatly disliked by the Labour Party elite during and after the war. After 1940, he sat as an Independent Labour member, and at the 1945 general election was re-elected in Hammersmith North under that label gaining a 63% share of the vote against official Labour and Conservative candidates. In 1949 he formed the Labour Independent Group with four other fellow travellers, including John Platts-Mills and Konni Zilliacus, who had also been expelled from the Labour Party for pro-Soviet sympathies. At the general election of 1950, all the members of the Labour Independent Group lost their seats. By this time, Pritt's opposition to the Cold War and NATO had made him an \"unpopular figure\" in Britain.\nPritt was awarded the 1954 International Stalin Peace Prize and in 1957 became an honorary citizen of Leipzig, which was then in East Germany. East Germany also awarded him the Gold Stern der Völkerfreundschaft (Star of People's Friendship) in October 1965.\n\nLegal career\nIn 1931, Pritt represented three Indian revolutionaries, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar and Shivaram Rajguru before the Privy Council, arguing that the ordinance which had been used to establish a special tribunal to try them for the crime of murdering a policeman was ultra vires. The appeal was rejected, and the three men were executed by hanging within a month of their trial on 23 March 1931. Pritt successfully defended Ho Chi Minh in 1931 against a French request for his extradition from Hong Kong. In 1933, Pritt was chairman of the \"International Commission of Inquiry into the Clarification of the Reichstag Fire\", the so-called \"London Counter-Process\" to the Leipzig Reichstag Fire Process. In 1942, he initially defended Gordon Cummins but, due to a technicality, the trial was abandoned and restarted with a new jury, and Pritt was replaced by another lawyer. Cummins, then a serving member of the Royal Air Force, was known in the press as the Blackout Ripper and was accused of murdering four women,  mutilating their bodies and attempting to murder two others. The defence was unsuccessful, a subsequent appeal was dismissed and Cummins was hanged in June 1942.\nPritt's most high-profile case, which he lost, was defending the Kapenguria Six, a group of Kenyan political figures accused in 1952 of links with the Mau Mau: Jomo Kenyatta, Bildad Kaggia, Kung’u Karumba, Fred Kubai, Paul Ngei and Achieng Oneko. In this case, Pritt worked with a team of African, Indian and Afro-Caribbean lawyers including Achhroo Ram Kapila, H. O. Davies, Dudley Thompson  and Fitz Remedios Santana de Souza.\nPritt played a significant role in the Singaporean \"Fajar trial\" in May 1954. He was the lead counsel of the University Socialist Club with the assistance of Lee Kuan Yew as the junior counsel and helped the club to win the case eventually. From 1965 to 1966, he was Professor of Law at the University of Ghana.\nPritt was said to have encouraged Billy Strachan, a fellow communist activist and one of the pioneers of black civil rights in Britain, to study law. Strachan then went onto be elected the President of Inner London Justices' Clerks' Society, and became an expert in laws regarding adoption, marriage, and drink driving.\n\nDeath and legacy\nPritt died in 1972 at his home in Pamber Heath, Hampshire. Denis Pritt Road in Nairobi, Kenya is named after him.\nPritt is one of those on Orwell's list, a list prepared by George Orwell for the Information Research Department in 1949, after the start of the Cold War. The list was officially published in 2003, but had circulated before then. It listed notable writers and others whom Orwell considered to be sympathetic to the Soviet Union. In the document, Orwell noted that Pritt was \"almost certainly underground Communist\", but also a \"Good MP (i.e. locally). Very able and courageous\".\n\nBibliography\nTo read online copies see Internet Archive\n\nLight on Moscow (1939)\nMust the War Spread?

        "content": "A Sailortown is a district in seaports that catered to transient seafarers. These districts frequently contained boarding houses, public houses, brothels, tattoo parlours, print shops, shops selling nautical equipment, and religious institutions offering aid to seamen; usually there was also a police station, a magistrate's court and a shipping office. Because it took several days, in the past, to unload ships, crews would spend this time in sailortown. These were \"generic locations—international everyplaces existing in nearly every port.\" Cicely Fox Smith wrote that 'dockland, strictly speaking, is of no country—or rather it is of all countries'\". Sailortowns were places where local people, immigrants, social and religious reformers, and transitory sailors met.\nSailortowns were found in major seaports, including London, Liverpool, Glasgow, Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Hull, Tyneside, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Hamburg, New York, San Francisco and many others in Europe, North and South America, West Indies, the East, Africa, and Australia.\nModern methods for handling cargo such as roll on, roll off techniques, and containerization mean that mariners spend less time ashore and this has led to the decline of sailortowns.\n\nLife in sailortown\nSailors were given their wages as a lump sum at the end of their voyage, and were exploited by crimps and other 'friends' of seafarers: \"crimps essentially took control of seafarers' wages and provided them with lodging and entertainment, like an agent.\" Crimps were also frequently agents for, or owners of, boarding-houses, and they might also have a connection with public houses, brothels, places of entertainment, and places to eat. An extreme version of crimping was shanghaiing, when seamen \"would be rendered senseless – either by drink, drugs or blunt instrument – and then were signed-on to a ship\".\nFolksinger and author Stan Hugill published, in 1967, a book on this topic, Sailortown, but his account has been criticized for \"relying almost exclusively on generalisation, titillation and shock-value\".\nDuring the nineteenth century, throughout the world, religious denominations established institutions in sailortowns to cater to the spiritual needs of sailors. One example was the Liverpool Sailors' Home project which was launched at a public meeting called by Liverpool's Mayor in October 1844. Such institutions provided such things, as \"board, lodging and medical attendance, at a moderate charge\" to protect seamen from extortion, as well as \"to promote their moral, intellectual, and professional improvement; and to afford them the opportunity of receiving religious instruction\". In addition the Liverpool Sailors’ Home had a reading-room, library, and savings bank. In 1859, in Sydney, Australia, a provisional committee of citizens was formed with the object of building a Sailors’ Home to provide them with comfortable accommodation while the seamen were ashore. Construction began in 1863, using a design similar to sailors’ homes in other seaports, on land in George Street North in the Rocks area.\n\nThe seaports\nLiverpool\nUntil the 1970s \"much of Liverpool's sailortown area was clustered around the city centre, extending inland from Albert, Canning and Salthouse Docks\". The area included \"a Sailor's Home and Seamen's Mission to dance halls, bars, boarding houses and shops with most connected to the port\".\nFound within this district, Liverpool's Sailors' Home, was designed to provide safe, inexpensive lodging for sailors, and to offer educational and recreational opportunities, in contrast to the temptations on offer in the docklands area. It was open for business in Canning Place, Liverpool, England, from December 1850 to July 1969.\nAmerican writer Herman Melville describes Liverpool's sailortown in his semi-autobiographical novel Redburn (1849).\n\nLondon\nLondon's Sailortown \"was clustered in a narrow strip of houses, taverns and slums on the north bank of the Thames, down river from the Tower of London, but also included \"the parishes of Wapping, Shadwell and Stepney\". This included the area known as Ratcliff, originally known for shipbuilding but from the fourteenth century more for fitting and provisioning ships. In the sixteenth century various voyages of discovery were supplied and departed from Ratcliffe, including those of Willoughby and Frobisher. By the early seventeenth century it had the largest population of any village in Stepney, with 3500 residents. Located on the edge of Narrow Street on the Wapping waterfront it was made up of lodging houses, bars, brothels, music halls and opium dens. This overcrowded and squalid district acquired an unsavoury reputation with a large transient population.\n\nBelfast\nSailortown was a working-class community in the docks area of Belfast, Northern Ireland. Established in the mid-19th century on partly reclaimed land, it had a mixed Protestant and Catholic population. Urban redevelopment in the late 1960s resulted in Sailortown's eventual demolition; only two churches, several pubs, and three houses remain of the once bustling waterfront enclave.\n\nCardiff's Tiger Bay\nDuring the nineteenth century as Cardiff's coal exports grew, so did its population; as dockworkers and sailors from across the world settled in neighbourhoods close to the docks, known as Tiger Bay (see also Butetown). This included immigrants from a wide variety of nationalities including Norwegian, Somali, Yemeni, Spanish, Italian, Caribbean, and Irish, helped to create the unique multicultural character of the area.\nTiger Bay had a reputation for being a tough and dangerous area. Merchant seamen arrived in Cardiff from all over the world, only staying for as long as it took to discharge and reload their ships. Consequently, the area became the red-light district of Cardiff, and many murders and lesser crimes went unsolved and unpunished, as the perpetrators had sailed away. However, locals who lived and stayed in the area describe a far friendlier place.\nFollowing the Second World War there was a major decline in the  importance of the docks and therefore of sailortown. In 1999, the area was redeveloped by the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, and renamed \"Cardiff Bay\".\n\nSan Francisco\nAccording to author Daniel Bacon, daytime San Francisco's \"old Barbary Coast was quiet, save for a few clothing shops, maritime businesses and auction houses\". However, in the evening it was dangerous a place of opium dens, crimping joints, bars, brothels and gambling dens, where unsuspecting sailors, \"after having completed a long journey were slipped Mickey Finns—whiskey laced with a dollop of opium—and shanghaied on two-year long voyages. Skippers paid crimps up to $75 a head to supply able-bodied hands to crew their vessels\".\nIt was not until the 1860s when sailors gave the district its name, and began to refer to it as the Barbary Coast. The term \"Barbary Coast\" is borrowed from the Barbary Coast of North Africa. That African region was also notorious for the same kind of predatory dives which would target sailors, as had been done on San Francisco's Barbary Coast. Miners, sailors, and others hungry for female companionship and bawdy entertainment streamed into San Francisco's Barbary Coast.\n\nSee also\nApostleship of the Sea (Roman Catholic)\nMission to Seafarers (Anglican)\nNautical fiction\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nBurton, Valerie. \"As I wuz a-rolling down the Highway one morn: Fictions of the 19th-century English Sailortown\" in Klein, B.

        "content": "Vitriol is the general chemical name encompassing a class of chemical compounds comprising sulfates of certain metals – originally, iron or copper.  Those mineral substances were distinguished by their color, such as green vitriol for hydrated iron(II) sulfate and blue vitriol for hydrated copper(II) sulfate.\nThese materials were found originally as crystals formed by evaporation of groundwater that percolated through sulfide minerals and collected in pools on the floors of old mines. The word vitriol comes from the Latin word vitriolus, meaning \"small glass\", as those crystals resembled small pieces of colored glass.\nOil of vitriol was an old name for concentrated sulfuric acid, which was historically obtained through the dry distillation (pyrolysis) of vitriols.  The name, abbreviated to vitriol, continued to be used for this viscous liquid long after the minerals came to be termed \"sulfates\".  The figurative term vitriolic in the sense of \"harshly condemnatory\" is derived from the corrosive nature of this substance.\n\nHistory\nThe study of vitriol began during ancient times. Sumerians had a list of types of vitriol that they classified according to the substances' color. Some of the earliest discussions of the origin and properties of vitriol is in the works of the Greek physician Dioscorides (first century AD) and the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD). Galen also discussed its medical use. Metallurgical uses for vitriolic substances were recorded in the Hellenistic alchemical works of Zosimos of Panopolis, in the treatise Phisica et Mystica, and the Leyden papyrus X.\nMedieval Islamic chemists like Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (died c. 806–816 AD, known in Latin as Geber), Abū Bakr al-Rāzī (865–925 AD, known in Latin as Rhazes), Ibn Sina (980–1037 AD, known in Latin as Avicenna), and Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm al-Watwat (1234–1318 AD) included vitriol in their mineral classification lists.\nSulfuric acid was termed \"oil of vitriol\" by medieval European alchemists because it was prepared by roasting \"green vitriol\" (iron(II) sulfate) in an iron retort. The first vague allusions to it appear in the works of Vincent of Beauvais, in the Compositum de Compositis ascribed to Saint Albertus Magnus, and in pseudo-Geber's Summa perfectionis (all thirteenth century AD).\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "RFA Fort Austin is a retired British Fort Rosalie-class dry stores ship of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.\nFort Austin was laid down at Scott Lithgow in 1975, launched in 1978 and commissioned in 1979. These ships were designed to carry a wide range of dry stores to support fleet task forces; ammunition, food, explosives. They have extensive aviation facilities, with two flight decks, one to the stern and one spot on top of the hangar, up to four Sea Kings can be stored in the large hangar.  These ships also have the capability to replenish ships at sea, via six RAS points.\n\nOperational history\nFalklands War 1982\nWhen the Falklands War began, the ship was deployed in the western Mediterranean for the annual Spring Train exercise, and received orders to head south, taking part in the landings at San Carlos Water as a stores and ammunition ship. When the order to head south was given, several warships had the WE.177A nuclear weapon deployed aboard. Amongst these were the Type 22 frigates HMS Broadsword and HMS Brilliant and the aircraft carriers HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible. Some newspaper reports also named RFA Fort Austin. The Ministry of Defence explored various options to transfer these nuclear weapons from the frigates to the safety of the deep magazines aboard Fort Austin, Hermes and Invincible. An MoD publication describes a complex series of manoeuvres to avoid the presence of these nuclear warheads in areas that would break the UK obligation to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, often referred to as the Latin-America Nuclear Free Zone. In no circumstances could ships carrying nuclear weapons enter territorial waters around the Falkland Islands. After the conflict ended, weapons were transferred at sea to the two RFAs Fort Austin and Resource for transport back to the UK.\n\n2000s\nIn 2000, the ship supported the British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War.\nBeginning in September 2007, the ship underwent a major refit and modernization at the A&P Tyne shipyard in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear.\nIn July 2009, RFA Fort Austin was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Portsmouth Naval Base. Following the Strategic Defence and Security Review of October 2010 it was decided to reactivate her at the expense of the larger RFA Fort George, which would be decommissioned.\n\n2010s\nOn 27 May 2011 Fort Austin left Portsmouth under tow by the Belgian tug Union Wrestler and tug Svitzer Pembroke for a £40m refit at Cammell Laird in Birkenhead. This refit was intended to keep her in service until 2021. Later that year it was announced that her service life would be extended until 2023; the Fort class will ultimately be replaced by the Fleet Solid Support element of the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability programme.\nShe left Birkenhead on 5 September 2012, arriving three days later at DM Crombie in the Firth of Forth. She arrived back in Plymouth at the end of 2012 and spent early 2013 exercising in home waters.\nFort Austin formed part of the COUGAR 13 task group, providing stores, fuel, water, and ammunition Fort Austin is also participating in the 2014 IMCMEX.\nIn 2015, Fort Austin was again laid up, this time in Birkenhead. Despite concerns she would be decommissioned she entered Cammell Laird for refit in 2017 and it was confirmed her planned out of service date had been revised to 2024. During the course of the refit, on 15 August 2017, Fort Austin suffered a fire on the upper deck. Her 60 crew were evacuated. The damage was not considered to be serious.\n\n2020s\nIn June 2020, Fort Austin was reported to be in extended readiness (reserve) with replenishment rigs not compatible with the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers. The defence white paper of 2021 announced that Fort Austin, along with Fort Rosalie, was to be decommissioned, with successors from the Fleet Solid Support plan set to replace the ships.\nOn 31 March 2021, the ship was withdrawn from service, and placed up for sale (recycling) on 21 May 2021, however, the notice for recycling was then withdrawn and the ship was sold to Egypt together with her sister ship, Fort Rosalie. While awaiting refit, it was reported that Fort Austin would be renamed ENS Luxor.\n\nNotes and references\nExternal links\n\nRFA Fort Austin - Royal Navy official website\nTimeline at www.historicalrfa.org"

GeorgeMemulous (talk) 16:38, 22 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport concept, oppose quality article is mostly just bullet points, I'll try to cannibalize a background from the last protest article, but right now I wouldn't say it's good enough for ITN inclusion. Scuba 17:44, 22 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport on principle but the articles need some expansion first. Estreyeria (talk) 17:55, 22 October 2024 (UTC)\nI think putting everything together kinda makes a bit of a mess of things from a blurb perspective. What seems most notable here is the blackout. It's not common that a complete blackout like this happens. DarkSide830 (talk) 18:02, 22 October 2024 (UTC)\nUnfortunately for Cuba it is somewhat common, as I mentioned there where blackouts earlier in the year that also caused protests. Scuba 18:05, 22 October 2024 (UTC)\nThere are levels to this sort of thing though. The article itself states \"The blackout is the most severe energy crisis that the country has experienced since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991\". Personally, I just don't much favor these \"x then y\" blurbs unless we believe both x and y are notable for ITN themselves. Conflating these three events is only valid for the former two, and I think having a distinct article for the protests themselves would help validate the inclusion of this piece of the blurb as well. DarkSide830 (talk) 18:18, 22 October 2024 (UTC)\nWait until the main blackout article has been expanded. As of now, the said article has been improved but it is still a stub. Though just like the nominator, I have no problems with regards to Hurricane Oscar's article. Vida0007 (talk) 00:33, 23 October 2024 (UTC)\nMerging the blackout and hurricane into one blurb about protests might be a little messy... are they protesting over Hurricane Oscar? Did Hurricane Oscar cause the blackouts? Are the protests related to the blackout or the hurricane? RachelTensions (talk) 01:37, 23 October 2024 (UTC)\nHurricane Oscar made landfall while the nation was under blackout and much information about Oscar was inaccessible due to it. Protests are surrounding the Cuban government's response. We do have an article on Criticism of the government response to Hurricane Katrina and this is comparable to that in my opinion; I strongly suspect the current death toll of 6 from Oscar is going to sharply rise once the nation comes out of blackout.

Joseph2302 (talk) 18:11, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nOppose Non-ITN sports (of which there are far too many; IMO there should one (1), the World Cup final) . Not global news. Let's not clog up the front page with more needless sports trivia This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 07:21, 22 October 2024 (UTC)\nOppose. I applaud the drive for better gender equality in sport, and cricket has made big strides in that over recent years. However women's T20I gets a small fraction of the attention that men's T20I does, even more so than the contrast in ODIs. That applies in terms of media coverage, TV audience, in-person spectators, prize money, number of teams etc. For a stark illustration, compare Google searches for 'T20 world cup\" in June, when the men's event occurred, vs October when the women's was happening [4]. FWIW, I supported adding the women's ODI world cup to ITNR - that continues to be the highest profile event in women's cricket. If we were to add a second women's cricket item I think the Women's Premier League has a better claim than the WT20 World Cup, though is very new so difficult to assess. Modest Genius talk 16:09, 22 October 2024 (UTC)\n\n(Posted) 2024 Moldovan European Union membership referendum\nMoldovans have voted to include the EU membership in the constitution, although this doesn’t mean they become EU member tomorrow, its significant. Important to note in the blurb that the yes vote doesn’t mean EU membership but the constitution being amended to aim for it. BastianMAT (talk) 06:03, 21 October 2024 (UTC) \nOppose: I see your point about the significance, but I think until Moldova actually joins the EU, it's not suitable for ITN. APK hi :-) (talk) 06:58, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nOppose - Country deciding whether to begin joining the EU is not notable in of itself, when/if Moldova actually joins (long way away due to Transnistria issue) then we can post PrecariousWorlds (talk) 07:30, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nDon't forget Gaguazia who have already said they'd go the way of Transnistria...and after the incumbent's repression, it seems more likely.2A00:F3C:A282:0:EC70:31F1:7740:DC70 (talk) 09:52, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nIf some crisis happens with Gaguazia like in 1991 then that's obviously notable but right now there's no indication of this happening PrecariousWorlds (talk) 17:52, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nAre we sure Transnistria is going to remain as their role model in the future? [5] Super Ψ Dro 23:50, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nOppose \"Country changes constitution to say they'd like to join a political union\". Not really headline news. If they ever join, that's a different matter but just expressing a desire to join is no different from the UK saying they'd like to \"reset\" their relationship with the EU.

So, in this context, a change to the country's constitution might be seen as far more significant. Martinevans123 (talk) 11:00, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nI dunno, tell that to all the oligarchs with pied a terres in central London... --Slowking Man (talk) 17:30, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport I'm baffled how anyone can oppose this; we sure posted UK's Brexit referendum how is this any different? Russia wasn't carving up Europe and threatening NATO back then either, at least not to such an extent. Abcmaxx (talk) 08:57, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSince they chose to leave. A decision that was in their hands. Moldova admission in the EU is not in their hands. Baffling how that is not clear. Posting this is like posting any referendum from any state. Ergo, clearly oppose.2A00:F3C:A282:0:EC70:31F1:7740:DC70 (talk) 09:48, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nAnd they can choose to join too. They can choose to meet all the criteria and work with the EU and be a part of it. Life changes significantly for the whole country and its population with such a decision. Abcmaxx (talk) 10:56, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nIf it were the case that the EU said to Moldova, \"you can join but only after you amend your constitution to allow that, and then you'd be in\", then that would be the reason to post. However, no process has been started at the EU side for the joining. There's a major step to accept their request to join. — Masem (t) 11:59, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nA democratic mandate is a major step in joining though, no country has so far joined the EU where the majority of people did not favour it as far as I'm aware, and most candidate nations did hold some kind democratic exercise to get approval for joining from the wider public. Abcmaxx (talk) 13:01, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\n\" A slim majority of 50.39% voted \"yes\" in Moldova's crunch referendum on European Union accession... \" per the linked article. Also, this is only an indication that the country will want to be in the EU in its constitution, it doesn't initiate at processes with the EU yet. The country will still have to formally apply, and the EU formally approve. Masem (t) 13:28, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport, both referendums and constitutional changes seem reasonable ITN news features, bars such as joining the EU are unworkably high-impact events. Article seems well-referenced. CMD (talk) 09:34, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSo a vote in Moldova is going to get them into the EU when? Do they get to decide so?2A00:F3C:A282:0:EC70:31F1:7740:DC70 (talk) 09:49, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nI don't understand how this is related to my comment. CMD (talk) 09:50, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport Seems newsworthy. Martinevans123 (talk) 09:40, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport - Very like the Brexit referendum (but facing the other way) - this provides a clear statement of national intent with a verifiable source, on a subject which may take a very long time to come to maturity. Waiting for EU accession isn't sensible; this is the story right now. (I don't believe that either constitutional amendments or national referendums should automatically be posted to ITN, but they definitely deserve serious consideration, and this one clears the bar for me.) GenevieveDEon (talk) 10:25, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nOppose Because this action needs agreement by the EU body before joining can actually happen, this is far too soon to post. Comparison to Brexit is bad because there, the only action that needed to be taken was the vote by the people to withdraw from the EU, no EU action was necessary as a second step to allow for them to leave. --Masem (t) 12:01, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nThe EU did need to undertake actions in order to facilitate Brexit, the UK didn't just take off and leave, it was/still is an incredibly slow and complex process. Abcmaxx (talk) 13:03, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nerrrrmm.... was it ever properly finished?? Martinevans123 (talk) 13:10, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nThe vote by the UK ppl was the point of no return. While there is formal steps required to have an agreement between the EU and UK on leaving, no action the EU would have stopped it, at worst, the EU/UK could have ended without any formal agreement post brexit in place. In this case, the EU must still formally approve the membership, so there is at least one more step thst will be ITN worthy, and we usually wait until that point of no return to post stories like this. Masem (t) 13:21, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nThere is a point of return, the UK can apply to rejoin at any moment. The same way if Moldova approves this constitutional change it can unapprove such a decision in another referendum should it wish to do so at a later date. Brexit shows you can join or leave if a country wishes to do so, however neither is immediate nor permanent. Abcmaxx (talk) 14:29, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nThis is completely untrue. The Brexit referendum was indicative rather than binding. The point of no return was the invocation of Article 50 in 2017. Similarly, this provision in Moldova is permissive rather than definitive - only an invitation from the EU and its subsequent acceptance would be binding. But like the Brexit referendum itself, this (quite narrowly) indicates a national direction of travel and sets a national and international policy agenda. And so I consider it highly newsworthy for the same reason. GenevieveDEon (talk) 15:01, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport- in the news, covered by NYT, CNN, The Kyiv Independent, Politico, The Guardian, WaPo, Le Monde, among others; many of those sites having multiple articles on the topic. Very clearly in the news. Abusing WP:CRYSTAL just opens the floodgates for not having anything on ITN, since you could argue that nothing can be posted since there's a chance that nothing will happen. IMHO, even if Moldova doesn't join the EU, this is still a big step and notable contemporary news story with a decent article that can be highlighted on the main page and interest readers searching for the topic or who are unaware. It would be better for us to have posted on ITN the results of this referendum even if Moldova doesn't join the EU than for us to have not posted it if Moldova did actually formally join.\nAlso totally agree with the folks making Brexit comparisons; you could have easily argued that we didn't know if Brexit was going to amount to anything as well (look at how convoluted and drawn out the actual leave process was). More evidence of the decline of grounded quality measures on this part of the MP over the past decade. — Knightoftheswords 12:52, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport very newsworthy, especially with the Pro-Russian camp openly cheating, and still losing. Scuba 13:12, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport With every nomination we see blanket opposition to posting just about any news. This is getting ridiculous. What's the point of ITN? We have a decent article, it's a national-level, constitutional referendum. It's in the news. I actually fail to understand what credible argument could possibly be against including this. If and when they ultimately join us utterly irrelevant. AusLondonder (talk) 13:22, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport This constitutional amendment is not only a change in the wording of Moldova's Carta Magna, but the submission of future governments to Europeanist aspirations and the elevation of these aspirations to a question of State in a country constantly threatened by Putin lately, which has a conflictive region on its borders (Transnistria) and which in recent years has aspired as never before to become part of the European bloc. Whether or not it finally joins the EU, which will not be possible in the short or medium term, is not decisive for the notoriety of this referendum. The article is in good condition, it is a news that opens covers in the international news sections and it is a historic result at regional level and important for other countries such as Georgia, Armenia or Bosnia. _-_Alsor (talk) 13:48, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport for most of the world, referendums are not a common event. Banedon (talk) 14:06, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport I sympathize with the gist of the oppose argument, and I actually agree that there is nothing inherently notable about a referendum of this sort. In this specific case, however, there is a higher degree of news coverage and notability because of the realpolitik and geopolitical implications of Moldova specifically gravitating towards western influence. Moldova is a former SSR. This move could have ramifications for Russian foreign policy towards the rest of Eastern Europe beyond Ukraine - and so, the news is covering it, as should we. FlipandFlopped  ツ 16:30, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport This is a pro-Western result in a country that experiences a lot of Russian influence & it’s being covered in a lot of reliable sources.

Also whew, given that vote tally I think \"narrowly vote\" is definitely called for here. When you're reporting a 50% tally with two decimal places, for a two-option ballot question, that's about as close as elections get. Again, here I think not conveying that information of \"very close result\" in blurb has potential to mislead—it is very very well-known in journalism that often the majority of people only read headlines, so be certain to put anything you for-sure-no-joke want conveyed, in that headline.

Joseph2302 (talk) 18:09, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nOppose Moldova was already accepted as a candidate for EU membership and so this event doesn't change much.  It's mostly internal politics, trying to lock in the current trajectory.  If the opposition parties were to take power then this constitutional amendment still couldn't force them to continue the process of membership against their will. Andrew🐉(talk) 18:15, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nTurkey has been an official candidate since 1999 and started applying as far back as 1959 yet they haven't taken any steps towards membership such as a popular vote.

I hope part of that time was spent participating in that key ITN/C discussion on the 2010 Turkish constitutional referendum, whose outcome the users back then knew damn well would establish an earth-shattering, long-standing precedence for what to post on ITN for many, many years to come.

Martinevans123 (talk) 21:28, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport Regardless of the outcome, it is notable in European and Moldovan politics and history. If Moldova succeeds in joining then it would be a new addition to the EU membership. If it fails, then it starts the precedent of Moldova attempts of joining the European Union.  Rager7 (talk) 21:31, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nNo, it hasn't started anything.  See Accession of Moldova to the European Union.  That started with an application in 2022 and formal negotiations started in June 2024.  There are six structural reforms required by the EU.  Changing the constitution isn't one of them. Andrew🐉(talk) 22:42, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nSupport key referendum that, had it failed, could have unexpectedly shaken the legitimacy of the current government that had been doing well in the polls. Moldova is a country widely described by international observers as between the West and Russia. This was an important event in regional geopolitics. I find the following quote related to the latter interesting: \"Georgia is watching Moldova and if the West fails in Chișinău, Tbilisi is next\" [Georgia is having a parliamentary election this Saturday]. The referendum is even more notable with the allegations of Russian interference. And lastly I think it's just interesting that the vote ended with such a narrow result, which challenged all expectations and had an insanely uncertain counting up until the last moments. Super Ψ Dro 23:28, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nBased on my last point, and agreeing with much of what Slowking Man said, I think we should reflect how close the vote was in the blurb. It could be enough to simply add \"narrowly\" before \"votes\". Even the narrow victory has implications for the current government as an overwhelming victory was widely expected. BastianMAT, what do you think? Super Ψ Dro 23:48, 21 October 2024 (UTC)\nYou certainly make a good point, I added an alt blurb with the word narrowly now, but it is up to the community to decide as the most important is that we convey the result of the referendum: that a constitutional amendment will be made.

        "content": "The Whitest Kids U' Know (WKUK) is an American sketch comedy television series starring a comedy troupe of the same name. The group consisted of Trevor Moore, Zach Cregger, Sam Brown, Timmy Williams and Darren Trumeter, though other actors occasionally appeared in their sketches. They were accepted into the HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in 2006 and won the award for Best Sketch Group.\n\nFormation\nThe Whitest Kids began in 1999 when Trevor Moore, a young comedian from Charlottesville, Virginia, transferred to New York's School of Visual Arts film program. Moore previously produced a local TV sketch-comedy show in Virginia titled The Trevor Moore Show, which was picked up by PAX Network.\nAfter making the rounds at local New York City comedy clubs, he eventually met fellow SVA film student Sam Brown from Massachusetts and SVA Graphic Design student/actor Zach Cregger, from Arlington, Virginia. By chance, all three lived in the same dormitory. According to an IFC interview, Trevor Moore said the group's name originated during a freestyle rapping session on a subway when one of their friends said, \"You guys are the whitest kids I know\".\nThe troupe started off as an officially sanctioned club at School of Visual Arts. During the early years, WKUK included Jon Kovel, Oliver Lyons, Jordan Cooper, Anthony Mair, and singer Tina Tiongson. Timmy Williams also joined in late 2001 and was the only member at the time who did not attend SVA.\nThe Whitest Kids U' Know held near-monthly free shows at SVA's amphitheater, which would frequently fill to capacity. Finally, in 2003, as Moore approached graduation, the group separated officially from the school, and all but Moore, Brown, Cregger and Williams left the troupe. Darren Trumeter, an actor and filmmaker who had worked on the set of an independent film with Cregger, was then added that same year.\nStarting in 2003, the reinvented troupe started touring the various comedy venues in New York City, concluding in early 2005 with a well-attended show at Caroline's, a famous stand-up comedy club in Times Square.\n\nTelevision\nIn 2005, the group began working with noted comedy producer Jim Biederman. In early 2006, Biederman and the Whitest Kids sold the show to the Fuse network after the Whitest Kids won the Best Sketch Group award at the Aspen Comedy Festival. Production of the first season took place in New York City, during the summer of 2006. The first season of The Whitest Kids U' Know premiered in March 2007. It was an instant hit for Fuse, and the show was immediately picked up for a second season.\nHowever, due to what Fuse perceived as extreme comedy, the second season order came with limitations on content. The group considered walking away from the pick up order over the new content restrictions. Then, however, head of Fuse programming Jennifer Caserta left to become the General Manager of the IFC network and brought the Whitest Kids along with her to IFC. At the time, Fuse and IFC were both part of Rainbow Media. The Rainbow Media executives felt that the Whitest Kids program was more appropriate for IFC than Fuse, so they approved the switch.\nOn July 12, 2007, Trevor Moore posted a message on the Whitest Kids U' Know's official website stating that the second season of the Whitest Kids' TV show would move to the Independent Film Channel (IFC). According to Moore, they were excited about the channel switch because it allowed for no commercial breaks, with vulgarities and obscene content uncensored. However, IFC began airing commercials during their programming on December 8, 2010, and the show was censored at certain times of day (including removing stronger sexual language such as \"fuck\" and censoring any nudity), despite promises that it would remain unedited.\nShooting for season two of the show started on August 13, 2007, and debuted on IFC on February 10, 2008.\nThe season one DVD was released on February 5, 2008. It was stated several times on the show that the season was going to be first released uncensored on DVD. However, IFC started to air uncensored episodes of season one just two months before the DVD release.\nThe tenth episode of season two was broadcast live on IFC. The sketches performed on stage were based on their stage shows. Trevor Moore stated the live episode was a response to the season being one episode short.\nThe third season, which premiered on IFC on January 27, 2009, in the 10 pm time slot, was composed of ten 30-minute episodes as well as twenty 15-minute episodes. Both formats played on IFC.\nThe fourth season premiered on June 11, 2010, on IFC, continuing with the ten 30-minute and twenty 15-minute episode formats.\nThe fifth season premiered on April 15, 2011, and was the final season of the show. The format of 10 half-hour episodes remains, with each episode ending with a segment of The Civil War on Drugs, a full-length film starring Whitest Kids troupe members reimagining the American Civil War as a war on drugs. Moore revealed that the film will be released on Amazon in feature-length with a commentary by him and the rest of the troupe.\n\nReturn\nOn May 6, 2020, Trevor Moore started a short-lived internet series during the COVID-19 pandemic titled \"Trevor Moore's Quarantine Show\" uploaded to a newly created YouTube channel called OfficialWKUK. Moore, Brown, Cregger, Trumeter, and Williams later started uploading more frequently to the channel featuring HD quality video of their sketches from their show. They also would occasionally upload a Dungeons & Dragons campaign entitled \"Buckerson and Meyers\" where they humorously attempt to complete the campaign laid out by Williams.\nOn September 5, 2020, the group started video streaming on Twitch with weekly scheduled shows with no permanent timeslots:\n\nCollective Souls –Cregger plays 2016 video game Dark Souls III, where he attempts to achieve a \"No Death Run\" and occasionally takes a fan or other members of the comedy troupe calls, during play. Typically he streams Monday, Wednesday, or Friday. On December 29, 2020, Cregger successfully achieved a no death run of Demon's Souls.\nTimmy Plays Animal Crossing –Williams plays the 2020 video game Animal Crossing: New Horizons, usually streaming on Monday.\nSam's Show For Depressed Losers –Brown hosts the show with no particular topic or plan in mind, occasionally streaming with Trumeter or viewers that call-in through Discord. Brown streams on Wednesdays.\nSexy Socks –Originally \"Sexy Stocks\", Trumeter and Brown discuss the stock market and converse with the Twitch chat room. They have the most inconsistent timeslot, streaming off and on Wednesday.\nZucchini Boyz –Williams cooks from recipes, live, usually taking requests from the Twitch chat room. He typically streams on Thursdays.\nNewsboyz –\"The flagship show\" according to co-host Trevor Moore. The show consists of Moore and co-host Zach Cregger reading news articles and discussing their week. Moore and Cregger spend the whole week without reading the news in an attempt to give more realistic takes while on the show. They refer to the show as \"the best show on the network\" much to the chagrin of the rest of the troupe. They have one of the most consistent time-slots streaming on Friday, 7 pm-9 pm PST.\nSelf Suck Saturday –The most popular show on the Twitch channel, the stream consists of the entire troupe watching sketches from their IFC television show, conversation with chat, and viewing fan art. Along with Newsboyz, it has one of the most consistent time-slots, streaming on Saturday at 7 pm PST.\nThey have stated all the money they make from the YouTube and Twitch will go to the production of their new animated film Mars.\nFollowing Moore's death on August 7, 2021, the remaining members have continued to stream occasionally.\n\nFilms\nMoore and Cregger wrote, directed, and starred in the 2009 comedy film Miss March.\nIn 2012, Moore wrote on his website that a true Whitest Kids U' Know movie was planned, and that the script was being written.\nOn February 11, 2017, Moore announced via Instagram that the film's script had been completed.\nOn November 17, 2020, Cregger revealed the name of the film to be Mars and will be animated instead of live-action. Cregger also mentioned instead of being funded by a studio they preferred to raise the money themselves.\nOn February 16, 2021, The Civil War on Drugs was released in its entirety on Amazon. The film had been originally aired in segments in the final season of The Whitest Kids U' Know in 2011.\nOn August 23, 2021, Cregger, speaking of Moore's passing and the film while livestreaming, stated \"We are going to finish Mars! All of Trevor's lines are recorded, he has given notes on the animatic, everything that we need to get done is done. So, the Mars that is going to be completed is the Mars that — I want everyone to know — Trevor signed off on.\" In September 2022, Cregger stated that the film has almost wrapped production, and that, as a result of Trevor's death, it would be the troupe's final project.\nOn April 17, 2024, it was announced that Mars would premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 6, 2024, with encore screenings on June 8 and 15. The film was directed by Sevan Najarian.\n\nAlbum\nThe Whitest Kids U' Know is the debut album of the New York City–based sketch comedy troupe, released in 2006.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nThe Whitest Kids U'Know at IMDb\nExtensive audio interview on public radio program The Sound of Young America"

        "content": "Hispanic and Latino Americans (Spanish: Estadounidenses hispanos y latinos; Portuguese: Estadunidenses hispânicos e latinos) are Americans of full or partial Spanish, Hispanic African and/or Latin American background, culture, or family origin. These demographics include all Americans who identify as Hispanic or Latino regardless of race. As of 2020, the Census Bureau estimated that there were almost 65.3 million Hispanics and Latinos living in the United States and its territories.\n\"Origin\" can be viewed as the ancestry, nationality group, lineage or country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States of America. People who identify as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race, because similarly to what occurred during the colonization and post-independence of the United States, Latin American countries had their populations made up of descendants of white European colonizers (in this case Portuguese and Spaniards), Native peoples of the Americas, descendants of black African slaves, post-independence immigrants coming from Europe, Middle East, and East Asia, as well as descendants of multiracial unions between these different ethnic groups. As one of the only two specifically designated categories of ethnicity in the United States, Hispanics and Latinos form a pan-ethnicity incorporating a diversity of inter-related cultural and linguistic heritages, the use of the Spanish and Portuguese languages being the most important of all. Most Hispanic and Latino Americans are of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Salvadoran, Dominican, Colombian, Guatemalan, Honduran, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, Venezuelan, or Nicaraguan origin. The predominant origin of regional Hispanic and Latino populations varies widely in different locations across the country. In 2012, Hispanic Americans were the second fastest-growing ethnic group by percentage growth in the United States after Asian Americans.\nMultiracial Hispanics (Mestizo) of Indigenous descent and Spanish descent are the second oldest ethnic groups (after the Native Americans) to inhabit much of what is today the United States. Spain colonized large areas of what is today the American Southwest and West Coast, as well as Florida. Its holdings included present-day California, Texas, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and Florida, all of which constituted part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, based in Mexico City. Later, this vast territory became part of Mexico after its independence from Spain in 1821 and until the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848. Hispanic immigrants to the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area derive from a broad spectrum of Hispanic countries.\n\nTerminology\nThe terms \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino\" refer to an ethnicity. \"Hispanic\" first came into popular use to refer to individuals with origins in Spanish-speaking countries after the Office of Management and Budget created the classification in 1977, as proposed by a subcommittee composed of three government employees, a Cuban, Mexican, and Puerto Rican American. The United States Census Bureau defines being Hispanic as being a member of an ethnicity, rather than being a member of a particular race and thus, people who are members of this group may also be members of any race. In a 2015 national survey of self-identified Hispanics, 56% said that being Hispanic is part of both their racial and ethnic background, while smaller numbers considered it part of their ethnic background only (19%) or racial background only (11%). Hispanics may be of any linguistic background; in a 2015 survey, 71% of American Hispanics agreed that it \"is not necessary for a person to speak Spanish to be considered Hispanic/Latino\". Hispanic and Latino people may share some commonalities in their language, culture, history, and heritage. According to the Smithsonian Institution, the term \"Latino\" includes peoples with Portuguese roots, such as Brazilians, as well as those of Spanish-language origin. The difference between the terms Hispanic and Latino is ambiguous to some people. The US Census Bureau equates the two terms and defines them as referring to anyone from Spain or the Spanish- or Portuguese-speaking countries of the Americas. After the Mexican–American War concluded in 1848, term Hispanic or Spanish American was primarily used to describe the Hispanos of New Mexico within the American Southwest. The 1970 United States census controversially broadened the definition to \"a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race\". This is now the common formal and colloquial definition of the term within the United States, outside of New Mexico. This definition is consistent with the 21st century usage by the US Census Bureau and OMB, as the two agencies use both terms Hispanic and Latino interchangeably. The Pew Research Center believes that the term \"Hispanic\" is strictly limited to Spain, Puerto Rico, and all countries where Spanish is the only official language whereas \"Latino\" includes all countries in Latin America (even Brazil regardless of the fact that Portuguese is its only official language), but it does not include Spain and Portugal.\n\nThe terms Latino and Latina are loan words from Italy and are ultimately from ancient Rome. In English, the term Latino is a condensed form of \"latinoamericano\", the Spanish term for a Latin American, or someone who comes from Latin America. The term Latino has developed a number of definitions. This definition, as a \"male Latin American inhabitant of the United States\", is the oldest definition which is used in the United States, it was first used in 1946. Under this definition a Mexican American or Puerto Rican, for example, is both a Hispanic and a Latino. A Brazilian American is also a Latino by this definition, which includes those of Portuguese-speaking origin from Latin America. In English, Italian Americans are not considered \"Latino\", as they are for the most part descended from immigrants from Europe rather than Latin America, unless they happen to have had recent history in a Latin American country.\nPreference of use between the terms among Hispanics in the United States often depends on where users of the respective terms reside. Those in the Eastern United States tend to prefer the term Hispanic, whereas those in the West tend to prefer Latino.\nThe US ethnic designation Latino is abstracted from the longer form latinoamericano. The element Latino- is actually an indeclinable, compositional form in -o (i.e. an elemento compositivo) that is employed to coin compounded formations (similar as franco- in francocanadiense 'French-Canadian', or ibero- in iberorrománico, etc.).\n\nThe term Latinx (and similar neologism Xicanx) have gained some usage. The adoption of the X would be \"[r]eflecting new consciousness inspired by more recent work by LGBTQI and feminist movements, some Spanish-speaking activists are increasingly using a yet more inclusive \"x\" to replace the \"a\" and \"o\", in a complete break with the gender binary. Among the advocates of the term LatinX, one of the most frequently cited complaints of gender bias in the Spanish language is that a group of mixed or unknown gender would be referred to as Latinos, whereas Latinas refers to a group of women only (but this is changed immediately to Latinos, if even a single man joins this female group). A 2020 Pew Research Center survey found that about 3% of Hispanics use the term (mostly women), and only around 23% have even heard of the term. Of those, 65% said it should not be used to describe their ethnic group.\nSome have pointed out that the term \"Hispanic\" refers to a pan-ethnic identity, one that spans a range of races, national origins, and linguistic backgrounds. \"Terms like Hispanic and Latino do not fully capture how we see ourselves\", says Geraldo Cadava, an associate professor of history and Hispanic studies at Northwestern University.\nAccording to 2017 American Community Survey data, a small minority of immigrants from Brazil (2%), Portugal (2%), and the Philippines (1%) self-identified as Hispanic.\n\nHistory\n16th and 17th centuries\nSpanish explorers were pioneers in the territory of the present-day United States. The first confirmed European landing in the continental United States was by Juan Ponce de León, who landed in 1513 at a lush shore he christened La Florida. In the next three decades, the Spanish became the first Europeans to reach the Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi River, the Grand Canyon and the Great Plains. Spanish ships sailed along the Atlantic Coast, penetrating to present-day Bangor, Maine, and up the Pacific Coast as far as Oregon. From 1528 to 1536, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and three fellows (including an African named Estevanico), from a Spanish expedition that foundered, journeyed from Florida to the Gulf of California. In 1540, Hernando de Soto undertook an extensive exploration of the present United States.\n\nAlso in 1540, Francisco Vásquez de Coronado led 2,000 Spaniards and Mexican natives across today's Arizona–Mexico border and traveled as far as central Kansas, close to the exact geographic center of what is now the continental United States. Other Spanish explorers of the US territory include, among others: Alonso Alvarez de Pineda, Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón, Pánfilo de Narváez, Sebastián Vizcaíno, Gaspar de Portolà, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Tristán de Luna y Arellano, and Juan de Oñate, and non-Spanish explorers working for the Spanish Crown, such as Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo. In 1565, the Spanish created the first permanent European settlement in the continental United States, at St. Augustine, Florida. Spanish missionaries and colonists founded settlements including in the present-day Santa Fe, New Mexico, El Paso, San Antonio, Tucson, Albuquerque, San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.\nSpanish settlements in the Americas were part of a broader network of trade routes that connected Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The Spanish established trade connections with indigenous peoples, exchanging goods such as furs, hides, agricultural products, and manufactured goods. These trade networks contributed to the economic development of Spanish colonies and facilitated cultural exchange between different groups.\n\n18th and 19th centuries\nAs late as 1783, at the end of the American Revolutionary War (a conflict in which Spain aided and fought alongside the rebels), Spain held claim to roughly half the territory of today's continental United States. From 1819 to 1848, the United States increased its area by roughly a third at Spanish and Mexican expense, acquiring the present-day U.S states of California, Texas, Nevada, Utah, most of Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona, and parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Wyoming through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo after the Mexican-American War, as well as Florida through the Adams-Onís treaty, and the U.S territory of Puerto Rico through the Spanish-American War in 1898. Many Latinos residing in those regions during that period gained U.S. citizenship. Nonetheless, many long-established Latino residents faced significant difficulties post-citizenship. With the arrival of Anglo-Americans in these newly incorporated areas, Latino inhabitants struggled to maintain their land holdings, political influence, and cultural traditions.\nThe discovery of gold in California in 1848 attracted people from diverse backgrounds, including Hispanic and Latino miners, merchants, and settlers. The Gold Rush led to a population boom and rapid economic growth in California, transforming the social and political landscape of the region.\nMany Hispanic natives lived in the areas that the United States acquired, and a new wave of Mexican, Central American, Caribbean, and South American immigrants had moved to the United States for new opportunities. This was the beginning of a demographic that would rise dramatically over the years.\n\n20th and 21st centuries\nDuring the 20th and 21st centuries, Hispanic immigration to the United States increased markedly following changes to the immigration law in 1965.  During the World Wars, Hispanic Americans and immigrants had helped stabilize the American economy from falling due to the industrial boom in the Midwest in states such as Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. While a percentage of Americans had fled their jobs for the war, Hispanics had taken their jobs in the Industrial world. This can explain why there is such a high concentration of Hispanic Americans in Metro Areas such as the Chicago-Elgin-Naperville, Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, and Cleveland-Elyria areas.\nHispanic and Latino Americans were actively involved in the broader civil rights movement of the 20th century, advocating for equal rights, social justice, and an end to discrimination and segregation. Organizations such as the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the United Farm Workers (UFW) fought for the rights of Hispanic and Latino workers and communities.\nHispanic contributions in the historical past and present of the United States are addressed in more detail below (See Notables and their contributions). To recognize the current and historic contributions of Hispanic Americans, on September 17, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson designated a week in mid-September as National Hispanic Heritage Week, with Congress's authorization. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan extended the observance to a month, designated National Hispanic Heritage Month. Hispanic Americans became the largest minority group in 2004.\nHispanic and Latino Americans increasingly sought political representation and empowerment during the 20th century. The election of individuals such as Edward Roybal, Henry B. González, and Dennis Chávez to Congress marked significant milestones in Hispanic political representation. Additionally, the appointment of individuals like Lauro Cavazos and Bill Richardson to cabinet positions highlighted the growing influence of Hispanic and Latino leaders in government.\nHispanic and Latino Americans became the largest minority group in the United States, contributing significantly to the country's population growth.  Efforts to preserve and promote Hispanic and Latino culture and heritage continued in the 21st century, including initiatives to support bilingual education, celebrate cultural traditions and festivals, and recognize the contributions of Hispanic and Latino individuals and communities to American society.\n\nDemographics\nAs of 2020, Hispanics accounted for 19–20% of the US population, or 62–65 million people. The US Census Bureau later estimated that Hispanics were under-counted by 5.0% or 3.3 million persons in the US census, which explains the 3 million range in the number above. In contrast, Whites were over-counted by about 3 million. The Hispanic growth rate over the April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2007, period was 28.7%—about four times the rate of the nation's total population growth (at 7.2%). The growth rate from July 1, 2005, to July 1, 2006, alone was 3.4%—about three and a half times the rate of the nation's total population growth (at 1.0%). Based on the 2010 census, Hispanics are now the largest minority group in 191 out of 366 metropolitan areas in the United States. The projected Hispanic population of the United States for July 1, 2050 is 132.8 million people, or 30.2% of the nation's total projected population on that date.\n\nGeographic distribution\nHispanic and Latino American population distribution over time\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nUS Metropolitan Statistical Areas with over 1 million Hispanics (2014)\n\nStates and territories with the highest proportion of Hispanics (2021)\n\nOf the nation's total Hispanic population, 49% (21.5 million) live in California or Texas. In 2022, New York City and Washington, D.C. began receiving significant numbers of Latino migrants from the state of Texas, mostly originating from Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, and Honduras.\nOver half of the Hispanic population is concentrated in the Southwest region, mostly composed of Mexican Americans. California and Texas have some of the largest populations of Mexicans and Central American Hispanics in the United States. The Northeast region is dominated by Dominican Americans and Puerto Ricans, having the highest concentrations of both in the country. In the Mid Atlantic region, centered on the DC Metro Area, Salvadoran Americans are the largest of Hispanic groups. Florida is dominated by Cuban Americans and Puerto Ricans. In both the Great Lakes states and the South Atlantic states, Mexicans and Puerto Ricans dominate. Mexicans dominate in the rest of the country, including the West, South Central and Great Plains states.\n\nNational origin\nAs of 2022, approximately 60.1% of the nation's Hispanic population were of Mexican origin (see table). Another 9.6% were of Puerto Rican origin, and with about 3.9% each of Cuban and  Salvadoran and about 3.7% Dominican origins. The remainder were of other Central American or of South American origin, or of origin directly from Spain. In 2017, Two thirds of all Hispanic Americans were born in the United States.\nThere are few immigrants directly from Spain, since Spaniards have historically emigrated to Hispanic America rather than to English-speaking countries. Because of this, most Hispanics who identify themselves as Spaniard or Spanish also identify with Hispanic American national origin. In the 2017 Census estimate approximately 1.76 million Americans reported some form of \"Spanish\" as their ancestry, whether directly from Spain or not.\nIn northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, there is a large portion of Hispanics who trace their ancestry to settlers from New Spain (Mexico), and sometimes Spain itself, in the late 16th century through the 17th century. People from this background often self-identify as \"Hispanos\", \"Spanish\" or \"Hispanic\". Many of these settlers also intermarried with local Native Americans, creating a mestizo population. Likewise, southern Louisiana is home to communities of people of Canary Islands descent, known as Isleños, in addition to other people of Spanish ancestry. Californios, Nuevomexicanos and Tejanos are Americans of Spanish and/or Mexican descent, with subgroups that sometimes call themselves Chicanos. Nuevomexicanos and Tejanos are distinct southwest Hispanic cultures with their own cuisines, dialects and musical traditions.\nNuyoricans are Americans of Puerto Rican descent from the New York City area. There are close to two million Nuyoricans in the United States. Prominent Nuyoricans include Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, US Supreme Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor, and singer Jennifer Lopez.\n\nRace and ethnicity\nHispanics come from multi-racial and multi-ethnic countries with diversity of origins; therefore, a Hispanic can be from any race or mix of races. The most common ancestries are: Native American, European and African. Many also have colonial era New Christian Sephardic Jewish ancestry. As a result of their racial diversity, Hispanics form an ethnicity sharing a language (Spanish) and cultural heritage, rather than a race.\nHispanic origin is independent of race and is termed \"ethnicity\" by the United States Census Bureau.\nOn the 2020 United States census, 20.3% of Hispanics selected \"White\" as their race. This marked a large drop when compared to the 2010 United States census in which 53.0% of Hispanics identified as \"White\". These Hispanics make up 12,579,626 people or 3.8% of the population.\nOver 42% of Hispanic Americans identify as \"some other race\". Of all Americans who checked the box \"Some Other Race\", 97 percent were Hispanic. These Hispanics make up 26,225,882 people or 42.2% of the Hispanic population.\nOver half of the \"two or more races\" respondents were Hispanics. These Hispanics make up 20,299,960 people or 32.7% of the Hispanic population.\nThe largest numbers of Black Hispanics are from the Spanish Caribbean islands, including the Cuban, Dominican, Panamanian and Puerto Rican communities.\nIn Puerto Rico, people have some Native Indigenous American ancestry as well as European and Canary Islander ancestry. There's also a population of predominantly African descent as well as populations of Native American descent as well as those with intermixed ancestries. Cubans are mostly of Iberian and Canary Islander ancestry, with some heritage from Native Indigenous Caribbean. There are also populations of Black Sub-Saharan ancestry and multi-racial people. The race and culture of each Hispanic country and their United States diaspora differs by history and geography.\nWelch and Sigelman found, as of the year 2000, lower interaction between Latinos of different nationalities (such as between Cubans and Mexicans) than between Latinos and non-Latinos. This is a reminder that while they are often treated as such, Latinos in the United States are not a monolith, and often view their own ethnic or national identity as vastly different from that of other Latinos.\n\nGenetics\nAn automosal DNA study published in 2019, focusing specifically on Native American ancestry in different ethnic/racial groups within the US, found that self-identified Hispanic Americans had a higher average amount of Native American ancestry compared to Black and non-Hispanic White Americans. On average, Hispanic Americans were found to be just over half European, around 38% Native American, and less than 10% African. However, these results, being an average of the entire Hispanic population, vary sharply between individuals and between regions. Hispanic participants from the West Coast and West South Central regions, where the Hispanic population is predominantly Mexican-American, had an average of 43% Native American ancestry. On the other hand, those from the Mid-Atlantic region, where the Hispanic population is predominantly of Puerto Rican or Dominican descent, averaged only 11% Native American ancestry.\n\nAge\nAs of 2014, one third, or 17.9 million, of the Hispanic population was younger than 18 and a quarter, 14.6 million, were Millennials. This makes them more than half of the Hispanic population within the United States.\n\nEducation\nHispanic K–12 education\nWith the increasing Hispanic population in the United States, Hispanics have had a considerable impact on the K–12 system. In 2011–12, Hispanics comprised 24% of all enrollments in the United States, including 52% and 51% of enrollment in California and Texas, respectively. Further research shows the Hispanic population will continue to grow in the United States, implicating that more Hispanics will populate US schools.\n\nThe state of Hispanic education shows some promise. First, Hispanic students attending pre-K or kindergarten were more likely to attend full-day programs. Second, Hispanics in elementary education were the second largest group represented in gifted and talented programs. Third, Hispanics' average NAEP math and reading scores have consistently increased over the last 10 years. Finally, Hispanics were more likely than other groups, including White people, to go to college.\nHowever, their academic achievement in early childhood, elementary, and secondary education lag behind other groups. For instance, their average math and reading NAEP scores were lower than every other group, except African Americans, and have the highest dropout rate of any group, 13% despite decreasing from 24%.\nTo explain these disparities, some scholars have suggested there is a Hispanic \"Education Crisis\" due to failed school and social policies. To this end, scholars have further offered several potential reasons including language barriers, poverty, and immigrant/nativity status resulting in Hispanics not performing well academically.\n\nEnglish-language learners\nCurrently, Hispanic students make up 80% of English-language learners in the United States. In 2008–2009, 5.3 million students were classified as English Language Learners (ELLs) in pre-K to 12th grade. This is a result of many students entering the education system at different ages, although the majority of ELLs are not foreign born. In order to provide English instruction for Hispanic students there have been a multitude of English Language programs. Schools make demands when it comes to English fluency. There are test requirements to certify students who are non-native English speakers in writing, speaking, reading, and listening, for example. They take an ELPAC test, which evaluates their English efficiency. This assessment determines whether they are considered ELL students or not. For Hispanic students, being an ELL student will have a big impact because it's additional pressure to pass an extra exam apart from their own original classes. Furthermore, if the exam is not passed before they attend high school, the student will fall behind in their courses due to the additional ELD courses instead of taking their normal classes in that year. However, the great majority of these programs are English Immersion, which arguably undermines the students' culture and knowledge of their primary language. As such, there continues to be great debate within schools as to which program can address these language disparities.\n\nImmigration status\nThere are more than five million ELLs from all over the world attending public schools in the United States and speaking at least 460 different languages. Undocumented immigrants have not always had access to compulsory education in the United States. However, since the landmark Supreme Court case Plyler v. Doe in 1982, immigrants have received access to K-12 education. This significantly impacted all immigrant groups, including Hispanics. However, their academic achievement is dependent upon several factors including, but not limited to time of arrival and schooling in country of origin. When non-native speakers arrive to the United States, the student not only enters a new country, language or culture, but they also enter a testing culture to determine everything from their placements to advancement into the next grade level in their education. Moreover, Hispanics' immigration/nativity status plays a major role regarding their academic achievement. For instance, first- and second- generation Hispanics outperform their later generational counterparts. Additionally, their aspirations appear to decrease as well. This has major implications on their post-secondary futures.\n\nSimultaneous bilingualism\nThere is a term \"simultaneous bilinguals\" it is emerged on the research from Guadalupe Valdez  she states that it is used by individuals who acquire two languages as a “first” language; that most American circumstantial bilinguals acquire their ethnic or immigrant language first and then acquire English. The period of acquisition of the second language is known as incipient bilingualism.\n\nHispanic higher education\nThose with a bachelor's degree or higher ranges from 50% of Venezuelans compared to 18% for Ecuadorians 25 years and older. Amongst the largest Hispanic groups, those with a bachelor's or higher was 25% for Cubans, 16% of Puerto Ricans, 15% of Dominicans, and 11% for Mexicans. Over 21% of all second-generation Dominican Americans have college degrees, slightly below the national average (28%) but significantly higher than US-born Mexican Americans (13%) and US-born Puerto Rican Americans (12%).\nHispanics make up the second or third largest ethnic group in Ivy League universities, considered to be the most prestigious in the United States. Hispanic enrollment at Ivy League universities has gradually increased over the years. Today, Hispanics make up between 8% of students at Yale University to 15% at Columbia University. For example, 18% of students in the Harvard University Class of 2018 are Hispanic.\nHispanics have significant enrollment in many other top universities such as University of Texas at El Paso (70% of students), Florida International University (63%), University of Miami (27%), and MIT, UCLA and UC-Berkeley at 15% each. At Stanford University, Hispanics are the third largest ethnic group behind non-Hispanic White people and Asians, at 18% of the student population.\n\nHispanic university enrollments\nWhile Hispanics study in colleges and universities throughout the country, some choose to attend federally-designated Hispanic-serving institutions, institutions that are accredited, degree-granting, public or private nonprofit institutions of higher education with 25 percent or more total undergraduate Hispanic full-time equivalent (FTE) student enrollment. There are over 270 institutions of higher education that have been designated as an HSI.\n\nHealth\nLongevity\nAs of 2016, life expectancy for Hispanic Americans is 81.8 years, which is higher than the life expectancy for White Americans (78.6 years). Research on the \"Hispanic paradox\"—the well-established apparent mortality advantage of Hispanic Americans compared to White Americans, despite the latter's more advantaged socioeconomic status—has been principally explained by \"(1) health-related migration to and from the US; and (2) social and cultural protection mechanisms, such as maintenance of healthy lifestyles and behaviors adopted in the countries of origin, and availability of extensive social networks in the US.\" The \"salmon bias\" hypothesis, which suggests that the Hispanic health advantage is attributable to higher rates of return migration among less-healthy migrants, has received some support in the scholarly literature. A 2019 study, examining the comparatively better health of foreign-born American Hispanics, challenged the hypothesis that a stronger orientation toward the family (familism) contributed to this advantage. Some scholars have suggested that the Hispanic mortality advantage is likely to disappear due to the higher rates of obesity and diabetes among Hispanics relative to White people, although lower rates of smoking (and thus smoking-attributable mortality) among Hispanics may counteract this to some extent.\n\nHealthcare\nAs of 2017, about 19% of Hispanic Americans lack health insurance coverage, which is the highest of all ethnic groups except for Indigenous Americans and Alaska Natives. In terms of extending health coverage, Hispanics benefited the most among US ethnic groups from the Affordable Care Act (ACA); among non-elderly Hispanics, the uninsured rate declined from 26.7% in 2013 to 14.2% in 2017. Among the population of non-elderly uninsured Hispanic population in 2017, about 53% were non-citizens, about 39% were US-born citizens, and about 9% were naturalized citizens. (The ACA does not help undocumented immigrants or legal immigrants with less than five years' residence in the United States gain coverage).\nAccording to a 2013 study, Mexican women have the highest uninsured rate (54.6%) as compared to other immigrants (26.2%), Black (22.5%) and White (13.9%). According to the study, Mexican women are the largest female immigrant group in the United States and are also the most at risk for developing preventable health conditions. Multiple factors such as limited access to health care, legal status and income increase the risk of developing preventable health conditions because many undocumented immigrants postpone routine visits to the doctor until they become seriously ill.\n\nMental health\nFamily separation\nSome families who are in the process of illegally crossing borders can suffer being caught and separated by border patrol agents. Migrants are also in danger of separation if they do not bring sufficient resources such as water for all members to continue crossing. Once illegal migrants have arrived to the new country, they may fear workplace raids where illegal immigrants are detained and deported.\nFamily separation puts US-born children, undocumented children and their illegal immigrant parents at risk for depression and family maladaptive syndrome. The effects are often long-term and the impact extends to the community level. Children may experience emotional traumas and long-term changes in behaviors. Additionally, when parents are forcefully removed, children often develop feelings of abandonment and they might blame themselves for what has happened to their family. Some children that are victims to illegal border crossings that result in family separation believe in the possibility of never seeing their parents again. These effects can cause negative parent-child attachment. Reunification may be difficult because of immigration laws and re-entry restrictions which further affect the mental health of children and parents. Parents who leave their home country also experience negative mental health experiences. According to a study published in 2013, 46% of Mexican migrant men who participated in the study reported elevated levels of depressive symptoms. In recent years, the length of stay for migrants has increased, from 3 years to nearly a decade. Migrants who were separated from their families, either married or single, experienced greater depression than married men accompanied by their spouses. Furthermore, the study also revealed that men who are separated from their families are more prone to harsher living conditions such as overcrowded housing and are under a greater deal of pressure to send remittance to support their families. These conditions put additional stress on the migrants and often worsen their depression. Families who migrated together experience better living conditions, receive emotional encouragement and motivation from each other, and share a sense of solidarity. They are also more likely to successfully navigate the employment and health care systems in the new country, and are not pressured to send remittances back home.\n\nVulnerabilities\nThe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 significantly changed how the United States dealt with immigration. Under this new law, immigrants who overstayed their visas or were found to be in the United States illegally were subject to be detained and/or deported without legal representation. Immigrants who broke these laws may not be allowed back into the country. Similarly, this law made it more difficult for other immigrants who want to enter the United States or gain legal status. These laws also expanded the types of offenses that can be considered worthy of deportation for documented immigrants. Policies enacted by future presidents further limit the number of immigrants entering the country and their expedited removal.\nMany illegal immigrant families cannot enjoy doing everyday activities without exercising caution because they fear encountering immigration officers which limits their involvement in community events. Undocumented families also do not trust government institutions and services. Because of their fear of encountering immigration officers, illegal immigrants often feel ostracized and isolated which can lead to the development of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. The harmful effects of being ostracized from the rest of society are not limited to just that of undocumented immigrants but it affects the entire family even if some of the members are of legal status. Children often reported having been victims of bullying in school by classmates because their parents are undocumented. This can cause them to feel isolated and develop a sense of inferiority which can negatively impact their academic performance.\n\nStress\nDespite the struggles Hispanic families encounter, they have found ways to keep motivated. Many immigrants use religion as a source of motivation. Mexican immigrants believed that the difficulties they face are a part of God's bigger plan and believe their life will get better in the end. They kept their faith strong and pray every day, hoping that God will keep their families safe. Immigrants participate in church services and bond with other immigrants that share the same experiences.< Undocumented Hispanics also find support from friends, family and the community that serve as coping mechanisms. Some Hispanics state that their children are the reason they have the strength to keep on going. They want their children to have a future and give them things they are not able to have themselves. The community is able to provide certain resources that immigrant families need such as tutoring for their children, financial assistance and counseling services. Some identified that maintaining a positive mental attitude helped them cope with the stresses they experience. Many immigrants refuse to live their life in constant fear which leads to depression in order to enjoy life in the United States. Since many immigrants have unstable sources of income, many plan ahead in order to prevent future financial stress. They put money aside and find ways to save money instead of spend it such as learning to fix appliances themselves.\n\nPoverty\nMany Hispanic families migrate to find better economic opportunities in order to send remittances back home. Being undocumented limits the possibilities of jobs that immigrants undertake and many struggle to find a stable job. Many Hispanics report that companies turned them down because they do not have a Social Security number. If they are able to obtain a job, immigrants risk losing it if their employer finds out they are unable to provide proof of residency or citizenship. Many look towards agencies that do not ask for identification, but those jobs are often unreliable. In order to prevent themselves from being detained and deported, many have to work under exploitation. In a study, a participant reported \"If someone knows that you don't have the papers ... that person is a danger. Many people will con them ... if they know you don't have the papers, with everything they say 'hey I'm going to call immigration on you.'\". These conditions lower the income that Hispanic families bring to their household and some find living each day very difficult. When an undocumented parent is deported or detained, income will be lowered significantly if the other parent also supports the family financially. The parent who is left has to look after the family and might find working difficult to manage along with other responsibilities. Even if families are not separated, Hispanics are constantly living in fear that they will lose their economic footing.\nLiving in poverty has been linked to depression, low self-esteem, loneliness, crime activities and frequent drug use among youth. Families with low incomes are unable to afford adequate housing and some of them are evicted. The environment in which the children of undocumented immigrants grow up in is often composed of poor air quality, noise, and toxins which prevent healthy development. Furthermore, these neighborhoods are prone to violence and gang activities, forcing the families to live in constant fear which can contribute to the development of PTSD, aggression and depression.\n\nEconomic outlook\nMedian income\nIn 2017, the US census reported the median household incomes of Hispanic Americans to be $50,486. This is the third consecutive annual increase in median household income for Hispanic-origin households.\n\nPoverty\nAccording to the US census, the poverty rate Hispanics was 18.3 percent in 2017, down from 19.4 percent in 2016. Hispanics accounted for 10.8 million individuals in poverty. In comparison, the average poverty rates in 2017 for non-Hispanic White Americans was 8.7 percent with 17 million individuals in poverty, Asian Americans was 10.0 percent with 2 million individuals in poverty, and African Americans was 21.2 percent with 9 million individuals in poverty.\nAmong the largest Hispanic groups during 2015 was: Honduran Americans & Dominican Americans (27%), Guatemalan Americans (26%), Puerto Ricans (24%), Mexican Americans (23%), Salvadoran Americans (20%), Cuban Americans and Venezuelan Americans (17%), Ecuadorian Americans (15%), Nicaraguan Americans (14%), Colombian Americans (13%), Argentinian Americans (11%), and Peruvian Americans (10%).\nPoverty affects many underrepresented students as racial/ethnic minorities tend to stay isolated within pockets of low-income communities. This results in several inequalities, such as \"school offerings, teacher quality, curriculum, counseling and all manner of things that both keep students engaged in school and prepare them to graduate\". In the case of Hispanics, the poverty rate for Hispanic children in 2004 was 28.6 percent. Moreover, with this lack of resources, schools reproduce these inequalities for generations to come. In order to assuage poverty, many Hispanic families can turn to social and community services as resources.\n\nCultural matters\nThe geographic, political, social, economic and racial diversity of Hispanic Americans makes all Hispanics very different depending on their family heritage and/or national origin. Many times, there are many cultural similarities between Hispanics from neighboring countries than from more distant countries, i.e. Spanish Caribbean, Southern Cone, Central America etc. Yet several features tend to unite Hispanics from these diverse backgrounds.\n\nLanguage\nSpanish\nAs one of the most important uniting factors of Hispanic Americans, Spanish is an important part of Hispanic culture. Teaching Spanish to children is often one of the most valued skills taught amongst Hispanic families. Spanish is not only closely tied with the person's family, heritage, and overall culture, but valued for increased opportunities in business and one's future professional career. A 2013 Pew Research survey showed that 95% of Hispanics adults said \"it's important that future generations of Hispanics speak Spanish\". Given the United States' proximity to other Spanish-speaking countries, Spanish is being passed on to future American generations. Amongst second-generation Hispanics, 80% speak fluent Spanish, and amongst third-generation Hispanics, 40% speak fluent Spanish. Spanish is also the most popular language taught in the United States.\n\nHispanics have revived the Spanish language in the United States, first brought to North America during the Spanish colonial period in the 16th century. Spanish is the oldest European language in the United States, spoken uninterruptedly for four and a half centuries, since the founding of Saint Augustine, Florida in 1565. Today, 90% of all Hispanics speak English, and at least 78% speak fluent Spanish. Additionally, 2.8 million non-Hispanic Americans also speak Spanish at home for a total of 41.1 million.\nWith 40% of Hispanic Americans being immigrants, and with many of the 60% who are US-born being the children or grandchildren of immigrants, bilingualism is the norm in the community at large. At home, at least 69% of all Hispanics over the age of five are bilingual in English and Spanish, whereas up to 22% are monolingual English-speakers, and 9% are monolingual Spanish speakers. Another 0.4% speak a language other than English and Spanish at home.\n\nAmerican Spanish dialects\nThe Spanish dialects spoken in the United States differ depending on the country of origin of the person or the person's family heritage. However, generally, Spanish spoken in the Southwest is Mexican Spanish or Chicano Spanish. A variety of Spanish native to the Southwest spoken by descendants of the early Spanish colonists in New Mexico and Colorado is known as Traditional New Mexican Spanish. One of the major distinctions of Traditional New Mexican Spanish is its use of distinct vocabulary and grammatical forms that make New Mexican Spanish unique amongst Spanish dialects. The Spanish spoken in the East Coast is generally Caribbean Spanish and is heavily influenced by the Spanish of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. Isleño Spanish, descended from Canarian Spanish, is the historic Spanish dialect spoken by the descendants of the earliest Spanish colonists beginning in the 18th century in Louisiana. Spanish spoken elsewhere throughout the country varies, although is generally Mexican Spanish.\nHeritage Spanish speakers tend to speak Spanish with near-native level phonology, but a more limited command of morphosyntax. Hispanics who speak Spanish as a second language often speak with English accents.\n\nSpanglish and English dialects\nHispanics have influenced the way Americans speak with the introduction of many Spanish words into the English language. Amongst younger generations of Hispanics, Spanglish, a term for any mix of Spanish and English, is common in speaking. As they are fluent in both languages, speakers will often switch between Spanish and English throughout the conversation. Spanglish is particularly common in Hispanic-majority cities and communities such as Miami, Hialeah, San Antonio, Los Angeles and parts of New York City.\nHispanics have also influenced the way English is spoken in the United States. In Miami, for example, the Miami dialect has evolved as the most common form of English spoken and heard in Miami today. This is a native dialect of English, and was developed amongst second and third generations of Cuban Americans in Miami. Today, it is commonly heard everywhere throughout the city. Gloria Estefan and Enrique Iglesias are examples of people who speak with the Miami dialect. Another major English dialect, is spoken by Chicanos and Tejanos in the Southwestern United States, called Chicano English. George Lopez and Selena are examples of speakers of Chicano English. An English dialect spoken by Puerto Ricans and other Hispanic groups is called New York Latino English; Jennifer Lopez and Cardi B are examples of people who speak with the New York Latino dialect.\nWhen speaking in English, American Hispanics may often insert Spanish tag and filler items such as tú sabes, este, and órale, into sentences as a marker of ethnic identity and solidarity. The same often occurs with grammatical words like pero.\n\nReligion\nAccording to a Pew Center study which was conducted in 2019, the majority of Hispanic Americans are Christians (72%), Among American Hispanics, as of 2018–19, 47% are Catholic, 24% are Protestant, 1% are Mormon, less than 1% are Orthodox Christian, 3% are members of non-Christian faiths, and 23% are unaffiliated. The proportion of Hispanics who are Catholic has dropped from 2009 (when it was 57%), while the proportion of unaffiliated Hispanics has increased since 2009 (when it was 15%). Among Hispanic Protestant community, most are evangelical, but some belong to mainline denominations. Compared to Catholic, unaffiliated, and mainline Protestant Hispanics; Evangelical Protestant Hispanics are substantially more likely to attend services weekly, pray daily, and adhere to biblical liberalism. As of 2014, about 67% of Hispanic Protestants and about 52% of Hispanic Catholics were renewalist, meaning that they described themselves as Pentecosal or charismatic Christians (in the Catholic tradition, called Catholic charismatic renewal).\nCatholic affiliation is much higher among first-generation Hispanic immigrants than it is among second and third-generation Hispanic immigrants, who exhibit a fairly high rate of conversion to Protestantism or the unaffiliated camp. According to Andrew Greeley, as many as 600,000 American Hispanics leave Catholicism for Protestant churches every year, and this figure is much higher in Texas and Florida. Hispanic Catholics are developing youth and social programs to retain members.\nHispanics make up a substantial proportion (almost 40%) of Catholics in the United States, although the number of American Hispanic priests is low relative to Hispanic membership in the church. In 2019, José Horacio Gómez, Archbishop of Los Angeles and a naturalized American citizen born in Mexico, was elected as president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nMedia\nThe United States is home to thousands of Spanish-language media outlets, which range in size from giant commercial and some non-commercial broadcasting networks and major magazines with circulations numbering in the millions, to low-power AM radio stations with listeners numbering in the hundreds. There are hundreds of Internet media outlets targeting US Hispanic consumers. Some of the outlets are online versions of their printed counterparts and some online exclusively.\nIncreased use of Spanish-language media leads to increased levels of group consciousness, according to survey data. The differences in attitudes are due to the diverging goals of Spanish-language and English-language media. The effect of using Spanish-language media serves to promote a sense of group consciousness among Hispanics by reinforcing roots in the Hispanic world and the commonalities among Hispanics of varying national origin.\nThe first Hispanic-American owned major film studio in the United States is based in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2017, Ozzie and Will Areu purchased Tyler Perry's former studio to establish Areu Bros. Studios.\n\nRadio\nSpanish language radio is the largest non-English broadcasting media. While other foreign language broadcasting declined steadily, Spanish broadcasting grew steadily from the 1920s to the 1970s. The 1930s were boom years. The early success depended on the concentrated geographical audience in Texas and the Southwest. American stations were close to Mexico which enabled a steady circular flow of entertainers, executives and technicians, and stimulated the creative initiatives of Hispanic radio executives, brokers, and advertisers. Ownership was increasingly concentrated in the 1960s and 1970s. The industry sponsored the now-defunct trade publication Sponsor from the late 1940s to 1968. Spanish-language radio has influenced American and Hispanic discourse on key current affairs issues such as citizenship and immigration.\n\nNetworks\nNotable Hispanic-oriented media outlets include:\n\nCNN en Español, a Spanish-language news network based in Atlanta, Georgia;\nESPN Deportes and Fox Deportes, two Spanish-language sports television networks.\nTelemundo, the second-largest Spanish-language television network in the United States, with affiliates in nearly every major U.S. market, and numerous affiliates internationally;\nTeleXitos an American Spanish language digital multicast television network owned by NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises.\nUniverso, a cable network that produces content for U.S.-born Hispanic audiences;\nUnivisión, the largest Spanish-language television network in the United States, with affiliates in nearly every major U.S. market, and numerous affiliates internationally. It is the country's fourth-largest network overall;\nUniMás, an American Spanish language free-to-air television network owned by Univision Communications.\nFusion TV, an English television channel targeting Hispanic audiences with news and satire programming;\nGalavisión, a Spanish-language television channel targeting Hispanic audiences with general entertainment programming;\nEstrella TV, an American Spanish-language broadcast television network owned by the Estrella Media.\nV-me, a Spanish-language television network;\nPrimo TV, an English-language cable channel aimed at Hispanic youth.;\nAzteca América, a Spanish-language television network in the United States, with affiliates in nearly every major U.S. market, and numerous affiliates internationally;\nFuse, a former music channel that merged with the Hispanic-oriented NuvoTV in 2015.\nFM, a music-centric channel that replaced NuvoTV following the latter's merger with Fuse in 2015.\n3ABN Latino, a Spanish-language Christian television network based in West Frankfort, Illinois;\nTBN Enlace USA, a Spanish-language Christian television network based in Tustin, California;\n\nPrint\nLa Opinión, a Spanish-language daily newspaper published in Los Angeles, California and distributed throughout the six counties of Southern California. It is the largest Spanish-language newspaper in the United States\nEl Nuevo Herald and Diario Las Américas, Spanish-language daily newspapers serving the greater Miami, Florida, market\nEl Tiempo Latino a Spanish-language free-circulation weekly newspaper published in Washington, D.C.\nLatina, a magazine for bilingual, bicultural Hispanic women\nPeople en Español, a Spanish-language magazine counterpart of People\nVida Latina, a Spanish-language entertainment magazine distributed throughout the Southern United States\n\nSports and music\nBecause of different cultures throughout the Hispanic world, there are various music forms throughout Hispanic countries, with different sounds and origins. Reggaeton and hip hop are genres that are most popular to Hispanic youth in the United States. Recently Latin trap, trap corridos, and Dominican dembow have gained popularity.\nSoccer is a common sport for Hispanics from outside of the Caribbean region, particularly immigrants. Baseball is a common among Caribbean Hispanics. Other popular sports include boxing, gridiron football, and basketball.\n\nCuisine\nHispanic food, particularly Mexican food, has influenced American cuisine and eating habits. Mexican cuisine has become mainstream in American culture. Across the United States, tortillas and salsa are arguably becoming as common as hamburger buns and ketchup. Tortilla chips have surpassed potato chips in annual sales, and plantain chips popular in Caribbean cuisines have continued to increase sales. The avocado has been described as \"America's new favorite fruit\"; its largest market within the US is among Hispanic Americans.\nDue to the large Mexican-American population in the Southwestern United States, and its proximity to Mexico, Mexican food there is believed to be some of the best in the United States. Cubans brought Cuban cuisine to Miami and today, cortaditos, pastelitos de guayaba and empanadas are common mid-day snacks in the city. Cuban culture has changed Miami's coffee drinking habits, and today a café con leche or a cortadito is commonly had at one of the city's numerous coffee shops. The Cuban sandwich, developed in Miami, is now a staple and icon of the city's cuisine and culture.\n\nFamilial situations\nFamily life and values\nHispanic culture places a strong value on family, and is commonly taught to Hispanic children as one of the most important values in life. Statistically, Hispanic families tend to have larger and closer knit families than the American average. Hispanic families tend to prefer to live near other family members. This may mean that three or sometimes four generations may be living in the same household or near each other, although four generations is uncommon in the United States. The role of grandparents is believed to be very important in the upbringing of children.\nHispanics tend to be very group-oriented, and an emphasis is placed on the well-being of the family above the individual. The extended family plays an important part of many Hispanic families, and frequent social, family gatherings are common. Traditional rites of passages, particularly Roman Catholic sacraments: such as baptisms, birthdays, first Holy Communions, quinceañeras, Confirmations, graduations and weddings are all popular moments of family gatherings and celebrations in Hispanic families.\nEducation is another important priority for Hispanic families. Education is seen as the key towards continued upward mobility in the United States among Hispanic families. A 2010 study by the Associated Press showed that Hispanics place a higher emphasis on education than the average American. Hispanics expect their children to graduate university.\nHispanic youth today stay at home with their parents longer than before. This is due to more years spent studying and the difficulty of finding a paid job that meets their aspirations.\n\nIntermarriage\nHispanic Americans, like many immigrant groups before them, are out-marrying at high rates. Out-marriages comprised 17.4% of all existing Hispanic marriages in 2008. The rate was higher for newlyweds (which excludes immigrants who are already married): Among all newlyweds in 2010, 25.7% of all Hispanics married a non-Hispanic (this compares to out-marriage rates of 9.4% of White people, 17.1% of Black people, and 27.7% of Asians). The rate was larger for native-born Hispanics, with 36.2% of native-born Hispanics (both men and women) out-marrying compared to 14.2% of foreign-born Hispanics. The difference is attributed to recent immigrants tending to marry within their immediate immigrant community due to commonality of language, proximity, familial connections, and familiarity.\n\nIn 2008, 81% of Hispanics who married out married non-Hispanic White people, 9% married non-Hispanic Black people, 5% non-Hispanic Asians, and the remainder married non-Hispanic, multi-racial partners.\nOf approximately 275,500 new interracial or interethnic marriages in 2010, 43.3% were White-Hispanic (compared to White-Asian at 14.4%, White-Black at 11.9%, and other combinations at 30.4%; \"other combinations\" consists of pairings between different minority groups and multi-racial people). Unlike those for marriage to Black people and Asians, intermarriage rates of Hispanics to White people do not vary by gender. The combined median earnings of White/Hispanic couples are lower than those of White/White couples but higher than those of Hispanic/Hispanic couples. 23% of Hispanic men who married White women have a college degree compared to only 10% of Hispanic men who married a Hispanic woman. 33% of Hispanic women who married a White husband are college-educated compared to 13% of Hispanic women who married a Hispanic man.\nAttitudes among non-Hispanics toward intermarriage with Hispanics are mostly favorable, with 81% of White people, 76% of Asians and 73% of Black people \"being fine\" with a member of their family marrying a Hispanic and an additional 13% of White people, 19% of Asians and 16% of Black people \"being bothered but accepting of the marriage\". Only 2% of White people, 4% of Asians, and 5% of Black people would not accept a marriage of their family member to a Hispanic.\nHispanic attitudes toward intermarriage with non-Hispanics are likewise favorable, with 81% \"being fine\" with marriages to White people and 73% \"being fine\" with marriages to Black people. A further 13% admitted to \"being bothered but accepting\" of a marriage of a family member to a White and 22% admitted to \"being bothered but accepting\" of a marriage of a family member to a Black. Only 5% of Hispanics objected outright marriage of a family member to a non-Hispanic Black and 2% to a non-Hispanic White.\nUnlike intermarriage with other racial groups, intermarriage with non-Hispanic Black people varies by nationality of origin. Puerto Ricans have by far the highest rates of intermarriage with Black people, of all major Hispanic national groups, who also has the highest overall intermarriage rate among Hispanics. Cubans have the highest rate of intermarriage with non-Hispanic White people, of all major Hispanic national groups, and are the most assimilated into White American culture.\n\nCultural adjustment\nAs Hispanic migrants become the norm in the United States, the effects of this migration on the identity of these migrants and their kin becomes most evident in the younger generations. Crossing the borders changes the identities of both the youth and their families. Often \"one must pay special attention to the role expressive culture plays as both entertainment and as a site in which identity is played out, empowered, and reformed\" because it is \"sometimes in opposition to dominant norms and practices and sometimes in conjunction with them\". The exchange of their culture of origin with American culture creates a dichotomy within the values that the youth find important, therefore changing what it means to be Hispanic in the global sphere.\n\nTransnationalism\nAlong with feeling that they are neither from the country of their ethnic background nor the United States, a new identity within the United States is formed called latinidad. This is especially seen in cosmopolitan social settings like New York City, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Underway is \"the intermeshing of different Latino subpopulations has laid the foundations for the emergence and ongoing evolution of a strong sense of latinidad\" which establishes a \"sense of cultural affinity and identity deeply rooted in what many Hispanics perceive to be a shared historical, spiritual, aesthetic and linguistic heritage, and a growing sense of cultural affinity and solidarity in the social context of the United States.\" This unites Hispanics as one, creating cultural kin with other Hispanic ethnicities.\n\nGender roles\nIn a 1998 study of Mexican Americans it was found that males were more likely to endorse the notion than men should be the sole breadwinners of the family, while Mexican American women did not endorse this notion.\n\nPrior to the 1960s countercultural movement, Mexican men often felt an exaggerated need to be the sole breadwinner of their families. There are two sides to machismo, the man who has a strong work ethic and lives up to his responsibilities, or the man who heavily drinks and therefore displays acts of unpleasant behavior towards his family.\n\nThe traditional roles of women in a Hispanic community are of housewife and mother, a woman's role is to cook, clean, and care for her children and husband; putting herself and her needs last. The typical structure of a Hispanic family forces women to defer authority to her husband, allowing him to make the important decisions, that both the woman and children must abide by.  In traditional Hispanic households, women and young girls are homebodies or muchachas de la casa (\"girls of the house\"), showing that they abide \"by the cultural norms ... [of] respectability, chastity, and family honor [as] valued by the [Hispanic] community\".\nMigration to the United States can change the identity of Hispanic youth in various ways, including how they carry their gendered identities. However, when Hispanic women come to the United States, they tend to adapt to the perceived social norms of this new country and their social location changes as they become more independent and able to live without the financial support of their families or partners. The unassimilated community views these adapting women as being de la calle (\"of [or from] the street\"), transgressive, and sexually promiscuous. A women's motive for pursuing an education or career is to prove she can care and make someone of herself, breaking the traditional gender role that a Hispanic woman can only serve as a mother or housewife, thus changing a woman's role in society. Some Hispanic families in the United States \"deal with young women's failure to adhere to these culturally prescribed norms of proper gendered behavior in a variety of ways, including sending them to live in ... [the sending country] with family members, regardless of whether or not ... [the young women] are sexually active\". Now there has been a rise in the Hispanic community where both men and women are known to work and split the household chores among themselves; women are encouraged to gain an education, degree, and pursue a career.\n\nSexuality\nAccording to polling data released in 2022, 11% of Hispanic American adults identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. This is more than twice the rate of White Americans or African Americans. Over 20% of Hispanic Millennials and Gen Z claimed an LGBT identity. The growth of the young Hispanic population is driving an increase of the LGBT community in the United States. Studies have shown that Hispanic Americans are over-represented among transgender people in the United States.\nAccording to Gattamorta, et al. (2018), the socially constructed notion of machismo reinforces male gender roles in Hispanic culture, which can lead to internalized homophobia in Hispanic gay men and increase mental health issues and suicidal ideation. However, according to Reyes Salinas, more recent research shows that there has been an explosive growth of LGBT self-identification among young Hispanic Americans, which may signal that the Hispanic attitudes towards LGBT have broken down. According to Marina Franco, polling conducted in 2022 suggests that the Hispanic community in America is largely accepting of LGBT people and gay marriage, which is significant in light of the rapid growth of LGBT self-identification among Hispanics.\n\nRelations with other minority groups\nAs a result of the rapid growth of the Hispanic population, there has been some tension with other minority populations, especially the African-American population, as Hispanics have increasingly moved into once exclusively Black areas. There has also been increasing cooperation between minority groups to work together to attain political influence.\n\nA 2007 UCLA study reported that 51% of Black people felt that Hispanics were taking jobs and political power from them and 44% of Hispanics said they feared African-Americans, identifying them (African-Americans) with high crime rates. That said, large majorities of Hispanics credited American Black people and the civil rights movement with making life easier for them in the United States.\nA Pew Research Center poll from 2006 showed that Black people overwhelmingly felt that Hispanic immigrants were hard working (78%) and had strong family values (81%); 34% believed that immigrants took jobs from Americans, 22% of Black people believed that they had directly lost a job to an immigrant, and 34% of Black people wanted immigration to be curtailed. The report also surveyed three cities: Chicago (with its well-established Hispanic community); Washington, D.C. (with a less-established but quickly growing Hispanic community); and Raleigh-Durham (with a very new but rapidly growing Hispanic community). The results showed that a significant proportion of Black people in those cities wanted immigration to be curtailed: Chicago (46%), Raleigh-Durham (57%), and Washington, DC (48%).\nPer a 2008 University of California, Berkeley Law School research brief, a recurring theme to Black/Hispanic tensions is the growth in \"contingent, flexible, or contractor labor\", which is increasingly replacing long term steady employment for jobs on the lower-rung of the pay scale (which had been disproportionately filled by Black people). The transition to this employment arrangement corresponds directly with the growth in the Hispanic immigrant population. The perception is that this new labor arrangement has driven down wages, removed benefits, and rendered temporary, jobs that once were stable (but also benefiting consumers who receive lower-cost services) while passing the costs of labor (healthcare and indirectly education) onto the community at large.\nA 2008 Gallup poll indicated that 60% of Hispanics and 67% of Black people believe that good relations exist between US Black people and Hispanics while only 29% of Black people, 36% of Hispanics and 43% of White people, say Black–Hispanic relations are bad.\nIn 2009, in Los Angeles County, Hispanics committed 30% of the hate crimes against Black victims and Black people committed 70% of the hate crimes against Hispanics.\n\nPolitics\nPolitical affiliations\nHispanics differ on their political views depending on their location and background. The majority (57%) either identify as or support the Democrats, and 23% identify as Republicans. This 34-point gap as of December 2007 was an increase from the gap of 21 points 16 months earlier. While traditionally a key Democratic Party constituency at-large, beginning in the early 2010s, Hispanics have begun to split between the Democrats and the Republican Party. In a 2022 study, it was found that 64% of Latinos surveyed had positive attitudes towards President Obama's executive actions on immigration, which was notably four percentage points lower than that of non-Hispanic Black respondents. It was also noted that support for undocumented immigrants was lowest among Latinos living in developing 'bedroom communities' or newly built suburbs designed for commuters. This was also the case for Latinos of affluent income levels, however they were still most likely to display a positive attitude towards undocumented immigrants, especially when compared to their non-Hispanic White counterparts.\nCuban Americans, Colombian Americans, Chilean Americans, and Venezuelan Americans tend to favor conservative political ideologies and support the Republicans. Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Dominican Americans tend to favor progressive political ideologies and support the Democrats. However, because the latter groups are far more numerous—as, again, Mexican Americans alone are 64% of Hispanics—the Democratic Party is considered to be in a far stronger position with the ethnic group overall.\nSome political organizations associated with Hispanic Americans are League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), the United Farm Workers, the Cuban American National Foundation and the National Institute for Latino Policy.\n\nPolitical impact\nThe United States has a population of over 60 million of Hispanic Americans, of whom 27 million are citizens eligible to vote (13% of total eligible voters); therefore, Hispanics have a very important effect on presidential elections since the vote difference between two main parties is usually around 4%.\n\nElections of 1986–1996\nDuring the 1986 midterm elections, Hispanic voter turnout was increasing, although it remained lower compared to other demographic groups. The political concerns of Hispanic communities during this period included immigration reform and civil rights, with modest gains for Latino candidates at state and local levels. In the 1988 presidential election, George H.W. Bush (Republican) and Michael Dukakis (Democrat) were the main contenders, and although Hispanic voters were becoming more engaged, their influence was still emerging. The 1990 Census highlighted the substantial growth of Hispanic populations in the United States, leading to greater attention from political parties to Hispanic issues and concerns.\nThe 1992 presidential election marked a significant shift as Bill Clinton (Democrat) engaged actively with Hispanic voters, resulting in increased Latino support and signaling a broader Democratic outreach. Clinton's administration would further stimulate Hispanic political activity. The 1994 midterm elections saw Republican gains and were significantly impacted by debates over immigration and welfare reform, including California's Proposition 187, which sought to limit public services for undocumented immigrants and mobilized many Latino voters.\nBy the 1996 presidential election, Bill Clinton's successful re-election campaign reflected the growing influence of Hispanic voters. Key issues for the Latino community during this time included immigration, education, and healthcare. The period also witnessed an increase in Latino representation in Congress with figures such as Bob Menendez and Luis Gutiérrez emerging as prominent leaders. Overall, the period from 1986 to 1996 marked a critical phase in the evolving political influence and representation of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the United States.\n\nElections of 1996–2006\nIn the 1996 presidential election, 72% of Hispanics backed President Bill Clinton. In 2000, the Democratic total fell to 62%, and went down again in 2004, with Democrat John Kerry winning Hispanics 54–44 against Bush. Hispanics in the West, especially in California, were much stronger for the Democratic Party than in Texas and Florida. California Hispanics voted 63–32 for Kerry in 2004, and both Arizona and New Mexico Hispanics by a smaller 56–43 margin. Texas Hispanics were split nearly evenly, favoring Kerry 50–49 over their favorite son candidate and Florida Hispanics (who are mostly Cuban American) backed Bush, by a 54–45 margin.\nIn 1998, California Proposition 227, which sought to eliminate bilingual education in public schools, was passed. This initiative highlighted the political mobilization of Latino communities and their influence on educational policy in California.\n\nThe 2000 presidential election was notably close, with George W. Bush winning the presidency over Al Gore. Bush's outreach to Hispanic voters, particularly in battleground states such as Florida, was a significant factor in his narrow victory. Despite the growing visibility of Hispanic candidates, their representation at the national level remained limited. By the 2002 midterm elections, there was a notable increase in Hispanic representation in Congress, with more Latino candidates successfully winning seats in the House of Representatives. This trend continued to grow, reflecting the expanding political engagement of Hispanic Americans. In the 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush was re-elected, with a notable increase in Hispanic support attributed to his campaign's targeted outreach efforts. Prominent Latino figures, including New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and U.S. Senators Ken Salazar, gained national recognition during this period.\nIn the 2006 midterm election, however, due to the unpopularity of the Iraq War, the heated debate concerning illegal Hispanic immigration and Republican-related Congressional scandals, Hispanics went as strongly Democratic as they have since the Clinton years. Exit polls showed the group voting for Democrats by a lopsided 69–30 margin, with Florida Hispanics for the first time split evenly.\nThe runoff election in Texas' 23rd congressional district was seen as a bellwether of Hispanic politics. Democrat Ciro Rodriguez's unexpected (and unexpectedly decisive) defeat of Republican incumbent Henry Bonilla was seen as proof of a leftward lurch among Hispanic voters; majority-Hispanic counties overwhelmingly backed Rodriguez and majority European-American counties overwhelmingly backed Bonilla.\n\nElections 2008–2012\nIn the 2008 Presidential election's Democratic primary, Hispanics participated in larger numbers than before, with Hillary Clinton receiving most of the group's support. Pundits discussed whether Hispanics would not vote for Barack Obama because he was African-American. Hispanics voted 2 to 1 for Mrs. Clinton, even among the younger demographic. In other groups, younger voters went overwhelmingly for Obama. Among Hispanics, 28% said race was involved in their decision, as opposed to 13% for (non-Hispanic) White people. Obama defeated Clinton.\nIn the matchup between Obama and Republican candidate John McCain, Hispanics supported Obama with 59% to McCain's 29% in the June 30 Gallup tracking poll. This was higher than expected, since McCain had been a leader of the comprehensive immigration reform effort (John McCain was born in Panama to parents who were serving in the US Navy, but raised in the United States). However, McCain had retreated from reform during the Republican primary, damaging his standing among Hispanics. Obama took advantage of the situation by running ads in Spanish highlighting McCain's reversal.\n\nIn the general election, 67% of Hispanics voted for Obama. with a relatively strong turnout in states such as Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and Virginia, helping Obama carry those formerly Republican states. Obama won 70% of non-Cuban Hispanics and 35% of the traditionally Republican Cuban Americans who have a strong presence in Florida. The relative growth of non-Cuban vs Cuban Hispanics also contributed to his carrying Florida's Hispanics with 57% of the vote.\nWhile employment and the economy were top concerns for Hispanics, almost 90% of Hispanic voters rated immigration as \"somewhat important\" or \"very important\" in a poll taken after the election. Republican opposition to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 had damaged the party's appeal to Hispanics, especially in swing states such as Florida, Nevada and New Mexico. In a Gallup poll of Hispanic voters taken in the final days of June 2008, only 18% of participants identified as Republicans. The 2010 midterm elections highlighted the growing influence of Hispanic Americans in U.S. politics. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, won a Senate seat, enhancing the visibility of Latino politicians in national politics.\nHispanics voted even more heavily for Democrats in the 2012 election with the Democratic incumbent Barack Obama receiving 71% and the Republican challenger Mitt Romney receiving about 27% of the vote. Some Hispanic leaders were offended by remarks Romney made during a fundraiser, when he suggested that cultural differences and \"the hand of providence\" help explain why Israelis are more economically successful than Palestinians, and why similar economic disparities exist between other neighbors, such as the United States and Mexico, or Chile and Ecuador. A senior aide to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called the remarks racist, as did American political scientist Angelo Falcón, president of the National Institute of Latino Policy. Mitt Romney's father was born to American parents in a Mormon colony in Chihuahua, Mexico. The Hispanic vote was crucial to Obama's re-election, particularly in swing states such as Florida, Colorado, and Nevada. The Obama campaign's focus on issues important to Latino voters, including immigration reform and healthcare, helped secure substantial support from the Hispanic community.\n\nElections 2014–2022\n\"More convincing data\" from the 2016 United States presidential election from the polling firm Latino Decisions indicates that Clinton received a higher share of the Hispanic vote, and Trump a lower share, than the Edison exit polls showed. Using wider, more geographically and linguistically representative sampling, Latino Decisions concluded that Clinton won 79% of Hispanic voters (also an improvement over Obama's share in 2008 and 2012), while Trump won only 18% (lower than previous Republicans such as Romney and McCain). Additionally, the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study found that Clinton's share of the Hispanic vote was one percentage point higher than Obama's in 2012, while Trump's was seven percentage points lower than Romney's. Trump's campaign was marked by controversial statements and policies regarding immigration, which galvanized Latino voters.\nOn June 26, 2018, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a millennial, won the Democratic primary in New York's 14th congressional district covering parts of The Bronx and Queens in New York City, defeating the incumbent, Democratic Caucus Chair Joe Crowley, in what has been described as the biggest upset victory in the 2018 midterm election season and at the age of 29 years, became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. She is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and has been endorsed by various politically progressive organizations and individuals. According to a Pew Research Center report, the 2020 election will be the first one when Hispanics are the largest racial or ethnic minority group in the electorate. A record 32 million Hispanics were projected to be eligible to vote in the presidential election, many of them first-time voters. On September 15, 2020, President Donald J. Trump announced his intent to nominate and appoint Eduardo Verastegui, to be a member of the President's Advisory Commission on Hispanic Prosperity if re-elected after days of the Democratic convention.\nHispanic communities across the United States were long held as a single voting bloc, but economic, geographic and cultural differences show stark divides in how Hispanic Americans have cast their ballots in 2020. Hispanics helped deliver Florida to Donald Trump in part because of Cuban Americans and Venezuelan Americans (along with smaller populations such as Nicaraguan Americans and Chilean Americans); President Trump's reelection campaign ran pushing a strong anti-socialism message as a strategy in Florida, to their success. However the perceived anti-immigrant rhetoric resonated with Mexican Americans in Arizona and the COVID-19 pandemic (Arizona being one of the states hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States). Many Latino voters in Nevada are members of the Culinary Union Local 226 and supported Biden based on Right-to-work standards. The takeaway may be this may be the last election cycle that the \"Hispanic vote\" as a whole is more talked about instead of particular communities within it, such as Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Mexican Americans and so on. In Texas like in Arizona and Nevada, the Hispanic community mainly being Mexican American; one in three Texan voters is now Hispanic. Biden did win the Hispanic vote in those states. But in Texas, 41 percent to 47 percent of Hispanic voters backed Trump in several heavily Hispanic border counties in the Rio Grande Valley region, a Democratic stronghold. In Florida, Trump won 45 percent of the Hispanic vote, an 11-point improvement from his 2016 performance reported NBC News. Recognizing Hispanics as a population that can not only make a difference in swing states like Arizona, Nevada, Texas or Florida, but also really across the country, even in places like Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the number of Hispanic eligible voters may be the reason for the thin margins. In 1984, 37 percent of Hispanics voted for Ronald Reagan and 40 percent voted for George W. Bush in 2004.\n\nIn Florida, even though Trump won Florida and gained Hispanic voters, Biden kept 53% of the Hispanic vote and Trump 45%. According to NBC News exit polls, 55% of Cuban Americans, 30% of Puerto Ricans and 48% of other Hispanics voted for Trump.\nSubsections of Hispanic voters have a range of historical influences vying to affect their votes. Cuban American voters, mostly concentrated in South Florida, tend to vote Republican in part because of their anathema for socialism, the party of Fidel Castro's government that many of their families fled. Mexican Americans, however, have no such historical relationship with either party. Puerto Rican voters who have left the island might be influenced by the territory's move towards statehood, as a referendum for Trump's relief effort after Hurricane Maria, or regarding how it is taxed. The 2020 presidential election was a major event, with Joe Biden defeating incumbent President Donald Trump. Biden's campaign focused on issues such as immigration reform, healthcare, and economic recovery, which resonated with many Latino voters. Despite Biden's win, Trump made significant inroads with Hispanic voters compared to 2016, particularly in Florida and Texas. This election highlighted the diverse political preferences within the Latino community and the growing complexity of its electoral impact.\nNationwide, Hispanics cast 16.6 million votes in 2020, an increase of 30.9% over the 2016 presidential election.\nAfter representative Filemon Vela Jr. resigned, Mayra Flores won a special election to succeed him, she won the election to the United States House of Representatives in June 2022. She was the first Mexican-born woman to serve in the House, but would go on to lose in the 2022 General election to Democrat Vicente Gonzalez.\n\nNotable contributions\nHispanic Americans have made distinguished contributions to the United States in all major fields, such as politics, the military, music, film, literature, sports, business and finance, and science.\n\nArts and entertainment\nIn 1995, the American Latino Media Arts Award, or ALMA Award was created. It is a distinction given to Hispanic performers (actors, film and television directors and musicians) by the National Council of La Raza. The number of Latin nominees at the Grammy Awards lag behind. Talking to People magazine ahead of music's biggest night in 2021, Grammy nominees J Balvin and Ricky Martin reflected on what it is mean to continue to represent Hispanics at awards shows like the Grammys. Martin, who served as a pioneer for the \"Latin crossover\" in the '90s told \"When you get nominated, it's the industry telling you, 'Hey Rick, you did a good job this year, congratulations.' Yes, I need that\", the 49-year-old says. \"When you walk into the studio, you say, 'This got a Grammy potential.' You hear the songs that do and the ones that don't. It's inevitable.\" Like Selena Gomez tapping into her roots, the influence Hispanics and reggaetón are having on the mainstream is undeniable.\n\nMusic\nThere are many Hispanic American musicians that have made a significant impact on the music industry and achieved fame within the United States and internationally, such as Christopher Rios better known by his stage name Big Pun, Jennifer Lopez, Joan Baez, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, Fergie, Pitbull, Victoria Justice, Linda Ronstadt, Zack de la Rocha, Gloria Estefan, Héctor Lavoe, Celia Cruz, Tito Puente, Kat DeLuna, Selena, Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony, Miguel, Carlos Santana, Christina Aguilera, Bruno Mars, Mariah Carey, Jerry García, Dave Navarro, Santaye, Elvis Crespo, Romeo Santos, Tom Araya, Sonny Sandoval, The Mars Volta, Los Lobos, Villano Antillano, South Park Mexican, Cuco, Malo, OhGeesy, Malu Trevejo, Ice Spice, Young M.A, Lloyd Banks, Exposé, Sweet Sensation, Jellybean, Immortal Technique, Brujeria, Fuerza Regida, Xavi, Aventura, Lunay, Myke Towers, Jay Wheeler, J.I., Amara La Negra, Joseline Hernandez, Lele Pons, Snow Tha Product, The Marías, Ángela Aguilar, Tego Calderón, Prince Royce, Don Omar, Eddie Palmieri, Wisin & Yandel, Melanie Martinez, Mariah Angeliq, That Mexican OT, MC Magic, TKA, La India, George Lamond, Sa-Fire, Cynthia, Lisa Lisa, Julieta Venegas, Intocable, Marisela, Pepe Aguilar, Jon Secada, Chayanne, DannyLux, Eslabon Armado, Iván Cornejo, Grupo Frontera, Yahritza y su Esencia, Herencia de Patrones, Omar Apollo, Eladio Carrión, Kid Frost, Cypress Hill, N.O.R.E., Fat Joe, Mellow Man Ace, Chicano Batman, Delinquent Habits, Lil Rob, Ritchie Valens, Ozomatli, BIA, Plan B, Chencho Corleone, Maye, Kap G, Tha Mexakinz, Brownside, Psycho Realm, A Lighter Shade of Brown, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Noriel, Baby Rasta, Brytiago, Farruko, J Álvarez, Darell, Ñengo Flow, Luis Fonsi, José Feliciano, Daddy Yankee, Lil Suzy, Judy Torres, Nayobe, Willie Colón, Jenni Rivera, Baby Bash, Frankie J, Larry Hernandez, Arcángel, De la Ghetto, Giselle Bellas, Juan Luis Guerra, Residente, Anuel AA, Ozuna, Lil Pump, 6ix9ine, Becky G, Ivy Queen, Cardi B, Kali Uchis, Bad Bunny, Rauw Alejandro, all of the members of all-female band Go Betty Go, Camila Cabello, two members of girl group Fifth Harmony: Lauren Jauregui and Ally Brooke, and two members of the nu metal band Nonpoint.\nHispanic music imported from Cuba (chachachá, mambo, and rhumba) and Mexico (ranchera and mariachi) had brief periods of popularity during the 1950s. Examples of artists include Celia Cruz, who was a Cuban American singer and the most popular Latin artist of the 20th century, gaining twenty-three gold albums during her career. Bill Clinton awarded her the National Medal of Arts in 1994.\nAmong the Hispanic American musicians who were pioneers in the early stages of rock and roll were Ritchie Valens, who scored several hits, most notably \"La Bamba\" and Herman Santiago, who wrote the lyrics to the iconic rock and roll song \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\". Songs that became popular in the United States and are heard during the holiday/Christmas season include \"¿Dónde Está Santa Claus?\", a novelty Christmas song with 12-year-old Augie Ríos which was a hit record in 1959 and featured the Mark Jeffrey Orchestra, \"Feliz Navidad\" by José Feliciano; and Mariah Carey’s 1994 song \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", which is the best-selling holiday song by a female artist. Miguel del Aguila wrote 116 works and has three Latin Grammy nominations.\nIn 1986, Billboard magazine introduced the Hot Latin Songs chart which ranks the best-performing songs on Spanish-language radio stations in the United States. Seven years later, Billboard initiated the Top Latin Albums which ranks top-selling Latin albums in the United States. Similarly, the Recording Industry Association of America incorporated \"Los Premios de Oro y Platino\" (The Gold and Platinum Awards) to certify Latin recordings which contains at least 50% of its content recorded in Spanish.\nIn 1989, Univision established the Lo Nuestro Awards which became the first award ceremony to recognize the most talented performers of Spanish-language music and was considered to be the \"Hispanic Grammys\". In 2000, the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (LARAS) established the Latin Grammy Awards to recognize musicians who perform in Spanish and Portuguese. Unlike The Recording Academy, LARAS extends its membership internationally to Hispanophone and Lusophone communities worldwide beyond the Americas, particularly the Iberian Peninsula. Becky G won favorite female Latin artist, a brand new category at the AMAs in 2020. For the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, the academy announced several changes for different categories and rules: the category Latin Pop Album has been renamed Best Latin Pop or Urban Album, while Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album has been renamed Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album.\n\nFilm, radio, television, and theatre\nAmerican cinema has often reflected and propagated negative stereotypes towards foreign nationals and ethnic minorities. For example, Hispanics are largely depicted as sexualized figures such as the Hispanic macho or the Hispanic vixen, gang members, (illegal) immigrants, or entertainers. However representation in Hollywood has enhanced in latter times of which it gained noticeable momentum in the 1990s and does not emphasize oppression, exploitation, or resistance as central themes. According to Ramírez Berg, third wave films \"do not accentuate Chicano oppression or resistance; ethnicity in these films exists as one fact of several that shape characters' lives and stamps their personalities\". Filmmakers like Edward James Olmos and Robert Rodriguez were able to represent the Hispanic American experience like none had on screen before, and actors like Hilary Swank, Michael Peña, Jordana Brewster, Ana de Armas, Jessica Alba, Natalie Martinez and Jenna Ortega have become successful. In the last decade, minority filmmakers like Chris Weitz, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon and Patricia Riggen have been given applier narratives. Portrayal in films of them include La Bamba (1987), Selena (1997), The Mask of Zorro (1998), Nothing like the Holidays (2008), Dora and the Lost City of Gold (2019), Being the Ricardos (2001), Father of the Bride (2022) and Josefina López's Real Women Have Curves, originally a play which premiered in 1990 and was later released as a film in 2002.\nHispanics have also contributed some prominent actors and others to the film industry. Of Puerto Rican origin: José Ferrer (the first Hispanic actor to win an acting Academy Award for his role in Cyrano de Bergerac), Auliʻi Cravalho, Rita Moreno, Chita Rivera, Raul Julia, Rosie Perez, Rosario Dawson, Esai Morales, Aubrey Plaza, Jennifer Lopez, Joaquin Phoenix and Benicio del Toro.

Kenny Ortega is an Emmy Award-winning producer, director and choreographer who has choreographed many major television events such as Super Bowl XXX, the 72nd Academy Awards and Michael Jackson's memorial service.\nHispanics are underrepresented in U.S. television, radio, and film. This is combatted by organizations such as the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors (HOLA), founded in 1975; and National Hispanic Media Coalition (NHMC), founded in 1986. Together with numerous Hispanic civil rights organizations, the NHMC led a \"brownout\" of the national television networks in 1999, after discovering that there were no Hispanic on any of their new prime time series that year. This resulted in the signing of historic diversity agreements with ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC that have since increased the hiring of Hispanic talent and other staff in all of the networks.\nLatino Public Broadcasting (LPB) funds programs of educational and cultural significance to Hispanic Americans. These programs are distributed to various public television stations throughout the United States.\nThe 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards was criticized by Hispanics; there were no major nominations for Hispanic performers, despite the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences publicizing their improved diversity in 2020. While there was a record number of Black nominees, there was only one individual Hispanic nomination. Hispanic representation groups said the greater diversity referred only to more African American nominees. When the Los Angeles Times reported the criticism using the term \"Black\", it was itself criticized for erasing Afro-Hispanics, a discussion that then prompted more investigation into this under-represented minority ethnic group in Hollywood. John Leguizamo boycotted the Emmys because of its lack of Hispanic nominees.\n\nFashion\nIn the world of fashion, notable Hispanic designers include Oscar de la Renta, Carolina Herrera, Narciso Rodriguez, Manuel Cuevas, Maria Cornejo, among others. Christy Turlington, Lais Ribeiro, Adriana Lima, Gisele Bündchen and Lea T achieved international fame as models.\n\nArtists\nNotable Hispanic artists include Jean-Michel Basquiat, Judith Baca, Carmen Herrera, Patssi Valdez, Gronk, Luis Jiménez, Félix González-Torres, Ana Mendieta, Ester Hernandez, Joe Shannon, Richard Serra, Abelardo Morell, Bill Melendez, María Magdalena Campos Pons, Sandra Ramos, Myrna Báez, Soraida Martinez and Yolanda Gonzalez.\n\nBusiness and finance\nThe total number of Hispanic-owned businesses in 2002 was 1.6 million, having grown at triple the national rate for the preceding five years.\nHispanic business leaders include Cuban immigrant Roberto Goizueta, who rose to head of The Coca-Cola Company.

Also a major sports team owner is Mexican-American Linda G. Alvarado, president and CEO of Alvarado Construction, Inc. and co-owner of the Colorado Rockies baseball team.\nThere are several Hispanics on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans. Alejandro Santo Domingo and his brother Andres Santo Domingo inherited their fathers stake in SABMiller, now merged with Anheuser-Busch InBev. The brothers are ranked No. 132 and are each worth $4.8bn. Jorge Perez founded and runs The Related Group. He built his career developing and operating low-income multifamily apartments across Miami. He is ranked No. 264 and is worth $3bn.\nThe largest Hispanic-owned food company in the United States is Goya Foods, because of World War II hero Joseph A. Unanue, the son of the company's founders. Angel Ramos was the founder of Telemundo, Puerto Rico's first television station and now the second largest Spanish-language television network in the United States, with an average viewership over one million in primetime. Samuel A. Ramirez Sr. made Wall Street history by becoming the first Hispanic to launch a successful investment banking firm, Ramirez & Co. Nina Tassler is president of CBS Entertainment since September 2004. She is the highest-profile Hispanic in network television and one of the few executives who has the power to approve the airing or renewal of series.\nSince 2021, magazine Hispanic Executive has released a list of 30 under 30 executives in the United States. Members include financial analyst Stephanie Nuesi, fashion entrepreneur Zino Haro, and Obama scholar Josue de Paz.\n\nGovernment and politics\nAs of 2007, there were more than five thousand elected officeholders in the United States who were of Hispanic origin.\nIn the House of Representatives, Hispanic representatives have included Ladislas Lazaro, Antonio M.

Some notable figures include Monica Puig, tennis player hailing from Puerto Rico, Monica Puig achieved historic success by winning the gold medal in women's singles at the 2016 Rio Olympics, marking Puerto Rico's first-ever Olympic gold medal in any sport. Laurie Hernandez, gymnastics athlete also of Puerto Rican descent, Laurie Hernandez secured a gold medal with the US gymnastics team at the 2016 Rio Olympics and added a silver medal on the balance beam, captivating audiences with her grace and skill. Jessica Mendoza, softball/baseball] of Mexican heritage, is celebrated as a former professional softball player and Olympic gold medalist (2004). She continues to inspire as a groundbreaking baseball analyst for ESPN, breaking barriers in sports broadcasting. Giselle Juarez, softball player of Mexican descent, emerged as a standout pitcher, leading the University of Oklahoma to victory in the 2021 NCAA Women's College World Series championship, showcasing her dominance on the mound. Linda Alvarado, made history as the first Hispanic woman to co-own a Major League Baseball team, the Colorado Rockies, breaking barriers and paving the way for diversity in professional sports ownership. Brenda Villa, water polo of Mexican descent, is a trailblazer in women's water polo, earning four Olympic medals (gold in 2012, silver in 2000 and 2008, bronze in 2004) and inspiring a generation with her leadership and achievements. Nancy Lopez, golf a Hall of Fame golfer of Mexican heritage, amassed an impressive 48 LPGA Tour victories, including three major championships, during her illustrious career, solidifying her legacy as one of golf's all-time greats. Sofia Huerta, player of Mexican and American descent, has excelled in professional soccer, showcasing her versatility and skill as a midfielder and forward in the NWSL and internationally with Mexico's national team, inspiring young athletes with her talent and determination.\n\nHispanic and Latino American men in sports\nFootball\nThere have been far fewer football and basketball players, let alone star players, but Tom Flores was the first Hispanic head coach and the first Hispanic quarterback in American professional football, and won Super Bowls as a player, as assistant coach and as head coach for the Oakland Raiders. Anthony Múñoz is enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, ranked No. 17 on Sporting News's 1999 list of the 100 greatest football players, and was the highest-ranked offensive lineman. Jim Plunkett won the Heisman Trophy and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, and Joe Kapp is inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame. Steve Van Buren, Martin Gramatica, Victor Cruz, Tony Gonzalez, Ted Hendricks, Marc Bulger, Tony Romo and Mark Sanchez can also be cited among successful Hispanics in the National Football League (NFL).\n\nBaseball\nHispanics have played in the Major Leagues since the very beginning of organized baseball, with Cuban player Esteban Bellán being the first (1873). The large number of Hispanic American stars in Major League Baseball (MLB) includes players like Ted Williams (considered by many to be the greatest hitter of all time), Sammy Sosa, Alex Rodriguez, Alex Rios, Miguel Cabrera, Lefty Gómez, Adolfo Luque, Iván Rodríguez, Carlos González, Roberto Clemente, Adrián González, Jose Fernandez, David Ortiz, Juan Marichal, Fernando Valenzuela, Nomar Garciaparra, Albert Pujols, Omar Vizquel, managers Miguel Angel Gonzalez (the first Hispanic Major League manager), Al López, Ozzie Guillén and Felipe Alou, and General Manager Omar Minaya.  Hispanics in the MLB Hall of Fame include Roberto Alomar, Luis Aparicio, Rod Carew, Orlando Cepeda, Juan Marichal, Pedro Martínez, Tony Pérez, Iván Rodríguez, Ted Williams, Reggie Jackson, Mariano Rivera, Edgar Martinez and Roberto Clemente. Afro-Hispanic players Martin Dihigo, Jose Mendez and Cristóbal Torriente are Hispanic Hall of Famers who played in the Negro leagues.\n\nBasketball\nTrevor Ariza, Mark Aguirre, Carmelo Anthony, Manu Ginóbili, Carlos Arroyo, Gilbert Arenas, Rolando Blackman, Pau Gasol, Jose Calderon, José Juan Barea and Charlie Villanueva can be cited in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Dick Versace made history when he became the first person of Hispanic heritage to coach an NBA team. Rebecca Lobo was a major star and champion of collegiate (National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)) and Olympic basketball and played professionally in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). Diana Taurasi became just the seventh player ever to win an NCAA title, a WNBA title and as well an Olympic gold medal. Orlando Antigua became in 1995 the first Hispanic and the first non-Black in 52 years to play for the Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nTennis\nNotable Hispanic and Latino American tennis players include legendary player Pancho Gonzales, as well as Olympic tennis champions Mary Joe Fernández and Gigi Fernández. Monica Puig, a Puerto Rican-born player, achieved significant recognition by winning the gold medal in women's singles at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nSoccer\nHispanics have made significant contributions to all major American sports and leagues, with a particularly notable impact on the growth of soccer in the United States. Soccer, being the most popular sport in the Spanish-speaking world, has been profoundly influenced by Hispanic heritage. This influence is evident in Major League Soccer (MLS), where teams such as LA Galaxy, Los Angeles FC, Houston Dynamo and Columbus Crew have substantial fan bases comprising primarily Mexican Americans. Notable Hispanic players in MLS include Tab Ramos, Claudio Reyna, Omar Gonzalez, Marcelo Balboa, Roger Espinoza, and Carlos Bocanegra.\n\nSwimming\nSwimmers Ryan Lochte (the second-most decorated swimmer in Olympic history measured by total number of medals) and Dara Torres (one of three women with the most Olympic women's swimming medals), both of Cuban ancestry, have won multiple medals at various Olympic Games over the years. Torres is also the first American swimmer to appear in five Olympic Games. Maya DiRado, of Argentine ancestry, won four medals at the 2016 games, including two gold medals.\n\nOther sports\nBoxing's first Hispanic American world champion was Solly Smith. Some other champions include Oscar De La Hoya, Miguel Cotto, Bobby Chacon, Brandon Ríos, Michael Carbajal, John Ruiz, Andy Ruiz Jr. and Mikey Garcia.\n\nRicco Rodriguez, Tito Ortiz, Diego Sanchez, Nick Diaz, Nate Diaz, Dominick Cruz, Frank Shamrock, Gilbert Melendez, Roger Huerta, Carlos Condit, Tony Ferguson, Jorge Masvidal, Kelvin Gastelum, Henry Cejudo and UFC Heavy Weight Champion Cain Velasquez have been competitors in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) of mixed martial arts.\nIn 1991, Bill Guerin whose mother is Nicaraguan became the first Hispanic player in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was also selected to four NHL All-Star Games. In 1999, Scott Gomez won the NHL Rookie of the Year Award.\nFigure skater Rudy Galindo; golfers Chi Chi Rodríguez, Nancy López and Lee Trevino; softball player Lisa Fernández; and Paul Rodríguez Jr., X Games professional skateboarder, are all Hispanic Americans who have distinguished themselves in their sports.\nIn gymnastics, Laurie Hernandez, who is of Puerto Rican ancestry, was a gold medalist at the 2016 Games.\nIn sports entertainment we find the professional wrestlers Hulk Hogan, Alberto Del Rio, Rey Mysterio, Eddie Guerrero, Tyler Black and Melina Pérez and executive Vickie Guerrero.\n\nAnti-Latino sentiment\nIn countries where the majority of the population is descended from immigrants, such as the United States, opposition to immigration sometimes takes the forms of nativism, racism, religious intolerance and xenophobia. Throughout US history, anti-Latino sentiment has existed to varying degrees at different times, and it was largely based on ethnicity, race, culture, Anti-Catholicism (see Anti-Catholicism in the United States), xenophobia (see Xenophobia in the United States), economic and social conditions in Hispanic America, and opposition to the use of the Spanish language. In 2006, Time magazine reported that the number of hate groups in the United States increased by 33 percent since 2000, primarily as a result of anti-illegal immigrant and anti-Mexican sentiment. According to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) statistics, the number of anti-Hispanic hate crimes increased by 35 percent since 2003 (albeit from a low level). In California, the state with the largest Hispanic population, the number of hate crimes which were committed against Hispanics almost doubled.\nIn 2009, the FBI reported that 4,622 of the 6,604 hate crimes which were recorded in the United States were anti-Hispanic, comprising 70.3% of all recorded hate crimes, the highest percentage of all of the hate crimes which were recorded in 2009. This percentage is contrasted by the fact that 34.6% of all of the hate crimes which were recorded in 2009 were anti-Black, 17.9% of them were anti-homosexual, 14.1% of them were anti-Jewish, and 8.3% of them were anti-White.\n\nDiscrimination\nIt is reported that 31% of Hispanics have reported personal experiences with discrimination whilst 82% of Hispanics believe that discrimination plays a crucial role in whether or not they will find success while they are living in the United States. The current legislation on immigration policies also plays a crucial role in creating a hostile and discriminatory environment for immigrants. In order to measure the discrimination which immigrants are being subjected to, researchers must take into account the immigrants' perception that they are being targeted for discrimination and they must also be aware that instances of discrimination can also vary based on: personal experiences, social attitudes and ethnic group barriers. The immigrant experience is associated with lower self-esteem, internalized symptoms and behavioral problems amongst Mexican youth. It is also known that more time which is spent living in the United States is associated with increased feelings of distress, depression and anxiety. Like many other Hispanic groups that migrate to the United States, these groups are often stigmatized. An example of this stigmatization occurred after 9/11, when people who were considered threats to national security were frequently described with terms like migrant and the \"Hispanic Other\" along with other terms like refugee and asylum seeker.\n\nImmigration reform\n1965: Immigration and Nationality Act (Hart-Celler Act)\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), enacted in 1952, serves as a foundational piece of US immigration law by consolidating and reorganizing various provisions into a unified framework. Since its enactment, the INA has undergone numerous amendments, reflecting its evolving role in immigration policy. It is codified in Title 8 of the United States Code (USC), which is the comprehensive collection of US laws. Title 8 specifically addresses \"Aliens and Nationality,\" and the INA's sections are aligned with corresponding US Code sections for clarity. For accuracy, the official U.S. Code is provided by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the US House of Representatives, with links available through USCIS.\n\n1986: Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), detailed in House Report 99-1000, introduced significant changes to US immigration law. Title I of the Act focused on controlling illegal immigration by making it unlawful for employers to hire or continue employing unauthorized aliens without verifying their work status. It established an employment verification system requiring employers to attest to and maintain records of employees' work eligibility. The Act also set up procedures for monitoring the verification system and addressing violations, while explicitly prohibiting the use of such verification for national identity purposes. Additionally, Title I outlined employer sanctions, including a public education period and a phased enforcement approach. Title II of the Act provided a legalization program for certain undocumented aliens who met specific criteria, including continuous residence in the U.S. since January 1, 1982. It authorized adjustment from temporary to permanent resident status under certain conditions and required the Attorney General to manage and disseminate information about the program. Title III addressed the reform of legal immigration, including provisions for temporary agricultural workers and adjustments to visa programs. The Act also established various commissions and reports to assess and improve immigration policies and enforcement measures.\n\n1996: Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA)\nThe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 expanded the definition of \"qualified alien\" under section 431 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 (8 USC 1641) to include certain categories of battered aliens. The new provisions added to 8 USC 1641 recognize battered aliens. Those who have experienced battery or extreme cruelty by a spouse or parent, or by a member of their family residing with them. As eligible for benefits if there is a substantial connection between the abuse and the need for assistance. This includes aliens with pending petitions for various statuses under the Immigration and Nationality Act, such as spousal or child status of a US citizen or applications for suspension of deportation. The act extends protections to aliens whose children have been subjected to similar abuse, provided there is no active participation by the alien in the abuse. It also includes alien children who reside with a parent who has been abused. These provisions do not apply if the abuser resides in the same household as the victim. The Attorney General is tasked with issuing guidance on the interpretation of \"battery\" and \"extreme cruelty\" and establishing standards for determining the connection between such abuse and the need for benefits.\n\n2012: Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)\nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a policy established on June 15, 2012, by Janet Napolitano, then Secretary of Homeland Security, under the Obama administration. The policy provides temporary relief from deportation and work authorization to certain young undocumented immigrants who meet specific criteria. DACA does not offer a pathway to permanent legal status. Instead, it grants temporary protection that requires renewal every two years. To be eligible, applicants must have arrived in the United States before the age of 16, be currently under the age of 31, and have continuously resided in the US since June 15, 2007. They must also be enrolled in school, have graduated from high school, or have been honorably discharged from the US Armed Forces or Coast Guard. Upon its implementation, DACA initially benefited approximately 832,881 individuals. The policy has been associated with various socioeconomic improvements among its recipients. According to a 2019 survey, DACA recipients experienced an 86 percent increase in their average hourly wage. This rise in wages has contributed to enhanced financial independence and increased consumer spending, which in turn has had positive economic effects. Recipients also reported improved job conditions and expanded educational opportunities, reflecting the broader impact of the policy on their quality of life. Overall, DACA has been a significant, though temporary, measure aimed at addressing the status of undocumented young immigrants and has had notable effects on their economic and educational outcomes.\nDACA's future has faced legal challenges, including a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end it and a 2021 decision declaring DACA unlawful, though it did not immediately affect current recipients. The Biden administration has since reaffirmed its support and proposed regulatory changes to secure the program's future.\n\nSee also\nPlaces of settlement in United States:\n\nList of U.S. communities with Hispanic- or Latino-majority in the 2010 census\nList of U.S. cities with large Hispanic and Latino populations\nList of U.S. cities by Spanish-speaking population\nHispanics and Latinos in New Jersey\nHispanics and Latinos in Massachusetts\nHispanics and Latinos in Washington, D.C.\nHispanics and Latinos in California\nHispanics and Latinos in Arizona\nHispanics and Latinos in New Mexico\nHispanics and Latinos in Texas\nHispanics and Latinos in Nevada\nHispanics and Latinos in Florida\nHispanics and Latinos in New York\nDiaspora:\n\nHispanics\nHispanic and Latin American Australians\nHispanic and Latin American Canadians\nLatin Americans in the United Kingdom\nHispanidad\nLatino diaspora\nLatin American Asian\nLatin Americans in Europe\nIndividuals:\n\nList of Hispanic and Latino Americans\nHispanics and Latinos in the American Civil War\nHispanic and Latino Americans in World War II\nHispanics and Latinos in the United States Air Force\nHispanics and Latinos in the United States Coast Guard\nHispanics and Latinos in the United States Marine Corps\nHispanics and Latinos in the United States Navy\nHispanic and Latino Admirals in the United States Navy\nHispanics and Latinos in the United States Naval Academy\nOther Hispanic and Latino Americans topics:\n\nBlack Hispanic Americans\nHispanic and Latino American Muslims\nLatin America–United States relations\nList of Latin American Jews\nNational Alliance for Hispanic Health\nPortugal–United States relations\nSpain–United States relations\nWhite Hispanic Americans\nList of U.S. place names of Spanish origin\nLatino National Survey, 2006\nLatino literature\nChicano movement\nTerritories of the United States\nTequila Party\nPuerto Rico statehood movement\nGeneral:\n\nRace and ethnicity in the United States census\nDemographics of the United States\nHistorical racial and ethnic demographics of the United States\nImmigration to the United States\nHistory of immigration to the United States\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n2000 Census\nHispanic Americans in Congress – Library of Congress\nHispanic Americans in the U.S. Army\nLatino-Americans Become Unofficial Face of Politics Abroad by Josh Miller, PBS, April 27, 2007\nLatino in America – CNN"

        "content": "== Charles I of England ==\nThe title of this article is misleading as England was not his sole kingdom.  Perhaps one of the regular editors would like to review that?  Shipsview (talk) 17:29, 30 August 2023 (UTC)\n\nSee Talk:Charles I of England/Archive 2#Requested move 29 June 2021. Celia Homeford (talk) 07:27, 6 September 2023 (UTC)\n\nFive members\nI'm wondering if the section on the Five Members should be summerised more and then linked to the article Five Members which should have all the details? Currently, I do not any such link. Jp2207 (talk) 23:55, 22 November 2023 (UTC)\n\nThere are two links to that article in that section. Celia Homeford (talk) 10:13, 30 November 2023 (UTC)\n@Celia Homeford, indeed there is already a link. Thanks for spotting that. But don't you think it is better to have the link to the main article as I did it and remove the other in-line link? This is common practice in the rest of the article where sections have their own page (Bishops' Wars, Irish Rebellion, Long Parliament). My thinking is that such sections should be broad summaries only, or relating to Charles part played in them obviously, and otherwise avoid details best left in their own articles. Thoughts? Jp2207 (talk) 17:16, 30 November 2023 (UTC)\n@DrKay, re my change may I suggest that the inclusion of the names is superfluous to an article on the life of Charles I? The Five Members article can be easily followed by anyone who cares to find them. I left in Pym as he was the clear leader of the parliamentary opposition to Charles at the time, as referenced several times in the prior section. But I will grant that my first effort is a bit clumsy. How about keeping it simple?:\n“On 3 January 1642, Charles directed Parliament to give up five specific members of the Commons - Pym included - on the grounds of high treason.”\nJp2207 (talk) 02:00, 24 December 2023 (UTC)\nNothing is lost by naming the five and it's weird to name Pym but not the others. DrKay (talk) 07:08, 24 December 2023 (UTC)\n@DrKay Simplicity is lost. And I explained why Pym is mentioned. Anyway, it was just a suggestion based on the existence of a whole article on the 5 members topic to avoid duplication. I can easily live with it as is. Jp2207 (talk) 17:59, 24 December 2023 (UTC)\n\nMartyrdom\nPer [1], all three articles are already linked from this one. Unsurprisingly, that's what I meant by 'repeated links'. Per [2], it's already in the main body. DrKay (talk) 19:05, 7 December 2023 (UTC)\n\nRequested move 15 February 2024\nSemi-protected edit request on 19 July 2024\n\nso, i'd like to change Elizabeth Stuart's birthday day, because you put \"29th\" december while she was born on the 28th. My sources are the wikipedia articles about Elizabeth Stuart.\nThanks again Amy2010ben (talk) 09:52, 19 July 2024 (UTC)\n\nWikipedia is not a reliable source, see WP:CIRC. The source given in the article (Weir 1996, pp. 252–254) says 29th, though I do appreciate that ODNB (https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/8637) says 28th. Other sources give both dates, e.g. [3].

        "content": "== Major (disambiguation) ==\nidentical to Talk: List of tennis tournaments#Major (disambiguation) -P64\nLast month I re-targeted Majors from Grand slam (tennis) to the disambiguation page, which covers both singular and plural (M/major/s). \nAnd I reported (Talk: Major (disambiguation)#Major golf and tennis tournaments) on the current redirection of several \"major\" terms, mainly those with golf or tennis expressions or targets. (Tennis is a latecomer that did not get many redirects.)\nMajor (disambiguation) needs attention. The latest revision is a big improvement in some respects and a big de- in others. See recent sections of that Talk page (Talk: Major (disambiguation)#Latest revisions -05-26 an -06-02). --P64 (talk) 16:48, 6 June 2012 (UTC)\n\nLet me repeat that all four simple redirects have men's golf targets: Major championship(s) and Major tournament(s). Simple redirects are therefore unavailable for tennis use.\nIt does not follow that this article should cover \"Grand Slam (tennis)\" in the sense \"slam\", \"grand slam\", \"Slam\", \"Grand slam\", or \"Grand Slam\" is a nickname for one of the major tennis championships or tournaments. That can be handled here by a footnote when one of the \"Major tennis ...\" titles is selected for that coverage.\n(repeat) Talk: Major (disambiguation)#Major golf and tennis tournaments. --P64 (talk) 17:09, 22 July 2012 (UTC)\n\n(Scope and emphasis)\nunder neutral heading /*(Scope and emphasis)*/ restore twice-reverted 1743-byte new section, except heading and two lead sentences -P64 (with reiteration immediately above)\n[...] I struggle to believe that anyone would fail to see the problems that needed rectifying.  Well, let's have a close look at the shit you keep putting back in.\n\nThe four Major tennis tournaments, also called \"Grand Slam tournaments\", \"slams\" and \"majors\", are the most important annual tennis tournaments.\nThe article title is Grand Slam, not major tennis tournaments, so the first term in bold should be Grand Slam.  You also got the capitalisation wrong anyway.  Putting in several minor perturbations of the names is unnecessary.  Otherwise you'd end up saying \"also called grand slam tournaments, grand slams, slams, major tennis tournaments, major tournaments, majors\", and that would be really stupid.\n\nThe term Grand Slam primarily refers to the achievement of winning all four major championships in a single year in one of the five disciplines: men's and women's singles; men's, women's, and mixed doubles.\nNo, it does not primarily refer to that.  If you said \"Roger Federer has won 17 grand slams\", it would not be understood to mean he's won all four titles in a single year 17 times.  \nSo, please do enlighten us all as to the good reasons why flawed writing must be kept.  If you could tell me after how long bad writing becomes immune from editing by virtue simply of its age, that would be very helpful. 190.44.158.38 (talk) 13:04, 22 July 2012 (UTC)\n\n190, the tone of opening and closing paragraphs is destructive.\nWolbo, that doesn't justify wholesale reversion of substantial talk.\nAfter restoring this twice-reverted comment I have provided a neutral heading and deleted the first two sentences only. --P64 (talk) 17:09, 22 July 2012 (UTC)\nWow someone took some anger pills this morning. If it's written that \"Roger Federer has won 17 grand slams\" it is written poorly, is not encyclopedic, and could very easily be misconstrued. \"Roger Federer has won 17 grand slams\" means exactly that he won 4 titles in a year, and did it 17 times. This was talked about in the past in multiple tennis articles whose names elude me right now. Throughout its history the correct term is winning a \"Major\" not winning a \"Grand Slam\". To this day Major is used in plenty of books and magazines along with interviews[1]. It has long standing backing. Now I realize that just because it is the longstanding name doesn't mean it's the only name. Certainly the press also uses the more recent \"grand slam tournament\" language and if the press uses something the general public starts to follow. Historian Bud Collins says it well in this article. We can take it to tennis project and talk about it there since it could affect thousands of articles. I feel the term \"major\" is the more proper term for an encyclopedia but we must also have \"grand slam tournament\" because of it's popularity in the press. I almost always use the term \"Major\" but others here use the term \"grand slam tournament\" or \"grand slam event\" and it's recognized that in prose the terms are interchangeable. But in an encyclopedic article talking specifically about the Majors I don't see why we should change the long standing sentence order. 190.44.158.38 has been editing since July 9 2012, this is his/her only tennis edit, and maybe he doesn't understand that he should bring this to talk \"before\" insisting on his version. Fyunck(click) (talk) 19:17, 22 July 2012 (UTC)\nYou can't surely be ignorant of the fact that \"Grand Slam\" is used all the time to refer to one of the tournaments and is not used \"primarily\" to mean the achievement of winning all four in a single year.  So you must realise that no matter what your own pedantic gripes are, the article should not say something that isn't true.\nAs for my editing history, you realise IPs change, right?  The first edit I ever made was in 2004.  So don't give me any shit about not \"understanding\".  When reverting substantial edits, you need to understand that \"the old version was there for a long time\" is not a sensible justification.  When trashing work that other people have done, have the basic courtesy to explain yourself.  190.44.158.38 (talk) 21:24, 22 July 2012 (UTC)\nYour first edit to the thing appears to be with the tag \"Tidied up massively\" which means pretty much nothing. And as for IPs, get yourself a real ID because right now your history is a short one. For all we know you could be a good wikipedian or some old banned editor back for more (which I'm starting to wonder about). And surely you also realize that the term Major is much more historically accurate and is used all the time as I noted. As for the term grand slam, well the word ain't is used a lot too but that doesn't make it correct English for an encyclopedia. You also seem to have added this material under 200.120.204.246 (which has been around since June 15, 2012) and David0811 reverted it with your once again revert reply being \"Don't be so fucking stupid...\". I then wrote \"looking closer, you got rid of the abundance of edits in your last revert. I liked the M dash fix, and we'll go with your styling of the opening sentence as a compromise, but not the exact wording\" to which your attitude was \"dick\" fetish\" and \"not into compromising\" with the following \"You want to be a dick about it? I'm not into compromising over quality or fetishising text just because no-one changed it for a while. This version is better.\". Maybe you have some issues but at least two editors have reverted you and yet you keep at it with a nasty tone. You need to be a bit calmer and bring it to talk if you want to change people's minds. Maybe you will and maybe not. Fyunck(click) (talk) 22:24, 22 July 2012 (UTC)\n\"Tidied up massively\" means I tidied it up massively.  Pretty simple really.  Whatever problem you have with the use of \"grand slam\" to refer to a single tournament is your problem, not mine.  Once you've convinced the world of sports journalism that they are getting it wrong, then you can change it here.  Until then, the article reflects the usage.  A simple question for you - is the title of this article \"major tennis tournament\" or is it \"grand slam\"? 190.44.158.38 (talk) 08:09, 24 July 2012 (UTC)\nI was wondering what happened to you in this discussion. The article is at \"Bill Clinton\" also, but the first line is the more accurate \"William Jefferson \"Bill\" Clinton\".

If you ever wanted to discuss things in a collegiate manner, you shouldn't have reverted my work with the utterly banal and uninformative \"reverted some of the last edit\".  If you don't have the courtesy to explain a revert, then you're not likely to be a productive person to discuss things with.

You are violating the manual of style with your foolish attempt to impose your own pov on the article.  190.44.158.38 (talk) 08:44, 24 July 2012 (UTC)\nThe burden is on you to convince us since yours is the \"new\" entry and it was reverted by others.

Fyunck(click) (talk) 09:27, 24 July 2012 (UTC)\nI made a good faith edit.  You demonstrated bad faith by reverting it without explanation.  Two other people reverted because they were too stupid to actually look at the edit, and falsely claimed that it was vandalism.  Your attempt to use their edits to pretend that there's a \"consensus\" here only further confirms your own bad faith.

(Offhand I recommend Major tennis tournaments but I don't really know enough to choose tournament over championship and I would look for WP guidelines about singular and plural titles before choosing.)

Fyunck(click) (talk) 08:18, 17 June 2014 (UTC)\n\nEditorial error on Golden Slam - tried to fix but was reverted\nI'm not sure why the burden of convincing has changed for this issue, but the term is \"Golden Slam\", just as it is \"Grand Slam.\" When talking about about winning over the course of an entire career we would change it to say \"career Golden Slam\", or \"career Grand Slam.\" If won over consecutive years it would be \"non-calendar year Golden Slam\" or \"non-calendar year Grand Slam.\" That's the way consensus has always been. I would suggest a revert of the recent change (as I tried to do) unless the editor can convince Tennis Project that a definition change is needed. Fyunck(click) (talk) 20:46, 11 January 2015 (UTC)\n\nThere was never a consensus about \"Golden Slam\" because the terminology itself was never discussed in the Project. It was mantained in that way because it was treated like the way the Grand Slam's terminology was, however it kept the \"Golden Slam\", \"Non-calendar year Golden Slam\" and \"Career Golden Slam\" topics separated when all 3 are part of the same subject (Golden Slam per se), going against WP:ACCESSIBILITY and WP:BODY (per MOS:HEADINGS).\nThe thing is: Grand Slam has a official definition by the ILTF (although they changed the definition in 1982, they reverted back a little time later), so the other definitions have different terms, but there isn't official definitions for the others terms (Golden Slam, Super Slam, Triple Crown, Boxed Set, etc) only being coined by media. It's true that the term was first used when Graf won all at the same year, but it has been used when other players when the five titles non-consecitively, such as Nadal, Serena and the Bryans. It can be seen in articles made agencies like Washington Post, ESPN Time Bleach Report, ATP and such. So, clearly Golden Slam hasn't a calendar-restrict definition.\nBut the way it was before was misleading calling Graf the only one to win the Golden Slam, implying that she was the only one that won the four majors and a golden medal in tennis hstory, which is untrue. And looking how the Super Slam section, that is at the same way is Golden Slam's one is now, didn't caused a discussion, I don't know why it has to be an issue for the Golden Slam. ABC paulista (talk) 01:15, 12 January 2015 (UTC)\nNot true. Graf IS the only player to win a Golden Slam. Period. Others have won non-calendar year Golden Slams or Career Golden Slams. Self revert and try to gain consensus for your change. Fyunck(click) (talk) 01:26, 12 January 2015 (UTC)\nCan you prove what are you saying? I see no sources.

Fyunck(click) (talk) 04:44, 12 January 2015 (UTC)\nI will only change something when the discussion is over. Please let's just keep discussuing about the issue itself for the sake of productivity. ABC paulista (talk) 14:15, 12 January 2015 (UTC)\nWell, a week passed and I still not seeing good refutations here. Can I revert back to the calendar Golden Slam? ABC paulista (talk) 04:17, 18 January 2015 (UTC)\n\nMost years between titles\nI think this should be added to this page (I just collated the info).\nMost years between first and last Grand Slam tournament won\n\nMen’s singles: 12 years – Pete Sampras (1990 US Open, 2002 US Open)\nWomen’s singles: 15 years – Serena Williams (1999 US Open, 2014 US Open)\nMen’s doubles:  19 years - Ken Rosewall (1953 Australian Open, 1972 Australian Open)\nWomen’s doubles: 19 years – Billie Jean King (1961 Wimbledon, 1980 US Open)\nMixed doubles (Men): 18.5 years – Bob Hewitt (1961 Australian Open, 1979 US Open)\nMixed doubles (Women): 32.5 years – Martina Navratilova (1974 French Open, 2006 US Open)  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 207.81.18.187 (talk) 22:29, 25 January 2015 (UTC)\nPossibly, but I just checked the first entry on your list and it is wrong. Ken Rosewall's first win in singles was 1953 and his last was in 1972... 19 years! And in looking at the second Helen Wills also went 15 years between her first and last title. So I'm dubious as to whether the others are correct. Fyunck(click) (talk) 00:53, 26 January 2015 (UTC)\nYes Fyunck is correct Rosewall's span is for singles and Moody is also 15 years 1923 US to 1938 WM.--Navops47 (talk) 01:40, 26 January 2015 (UTC)\nLooking further, while men's doubles and Ken Rosewall look good, the ladies doubles is way off. Elizabeth Ryan had a 20 year span, but Thelma Coyne Long was 22 years between first and last victories. I think Martina and Hewitt are correct for mixed doubles. Fyunck(click) (talk) 05:39, 26 January 2015 (UTC)\nWell, regardless - it just proves that these records should be double-checked officially and then listed on this thread. This info can't be found anywhere on the internet...  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 207.81.18.187 (talk) 06:17, 26 January 2015 (UTC)\n\nModern 'misuse' of the term\nIn recent years 'Grand Slam' seems to be widely used (or arguably mis-used) as shorthand for 'Grand Slam Tournament' in tennis, sometimes even in Wikipedia. Indeed so common has this become that when Boris Becker opined on the BBC a few years ago that Rod Laver was the greatest player ever because he had won 2 Grand Slams, another panelist felt the need to clarify what he had said for the benefit of those viewers who would have understood this to mean that Laver had won 2 Grand Slam tournaments. No such confusion arises in golf where the Grand Slam tournaments are always called Majors, not Grand Slams, although maybe this will change with golf now being in the Olympics (assuming, perhaps mistakenly, that 'Grand Slam tournament' came about to avoid arguments over whether the Olympic title was a 'major' title). Could somebody please perhaps find some Reliable Source(s) that mention(s) and/or discuss(es) this confusion, and then mention the issue in the lead and/or in the 'origin of the term' section (possibly renamed to something like 'Origin of the term and current usage')? Tlhslobus (talk) 06:07, 12 July 2015 (UTC)\n\nThis is true. Though we do have the line \"The term Grand Slam also, and originally, refers to the achievement of winning all four major championships in a single calendar year within one of the five events...\" and it is in the lead. I don't think more needs to be mentioned in the lead, but perhaps in the body proper more could be said. I hear player interviews today and many use Majors and many use Grand Slams (as a shorthand for Grand Slam tournaments). I'm old school so Grand Slams used in this way is very peculiar to me. I find it improper (like the word ain't) but there is no denying that it is in the vernacular of lots of people. So much so that the tournaments themselves now use the term at times. I'll have took and see if anything in depth has been discussed in a magazine or book. Thanks for the query. Fyunck(click) (talk) 06:27, 12 July 2015 (UTC)\nThanks. I note that this issue does get half a sentence in the Grand Slam disambiguation article's Tennis section (\"; also a nickname for each of the major tournaments\"), but this seems both rather inadequate and very likely to be missed by most interested readers. (It's also arguably inaccurate - is a rather confusing abbreviation for a class of events really a nickname for each event?) Tlhslobus (talk) 06:42, 12 July 2015 (UTC)\n\nSerena Slam\nI don't know what's going on. Usually, to add some record or noteworthy info here we usually wait until a streak ends. As now, US Open didn't started yet and we don't know if this Serena Slam will become a CYGS. And we don't add NCYGSs that contain CYGSs within it, as we don't see Budge's 6 slam streak, Connolly's 6 slam streak or Graf's 5 slam streak at the NCYGS's section, since both contain CYGS in the achievement. ABC paulista (talk) 22:12, 11 July 2015 (UTC)\n\nBut she currently has the Serena Slam now, and that should be acknowledged in this article that at the present time, she holds all four Grand Slams, in a non-calendar year. If/when she wins the US Open, then the information should be moved to the CYGS section. Budge, Connolly and Graf don't need their streaks placed in the NCYGS section because they contain CYGS. Serena's, the moment, is not a CYGS. If it becomes one, then it should be moved accordingly. It doesn't make sense to completely omit accurate information in the hopes that it becomes a new record. If Nadal had an 82-match streak on clay at the end of the French Open that broke the record of the previous streak, we would say he had an 82-match streak on clay as of June 20XX, we wouldn't wait until the first loss in order to add the information in. Piratesswoop (talk) 01:54, 15 July 2015 (UTC)\nWhy are we holding back this factual info? We can always change it if need be. This Martina Slam/Serena Slam is news and it seems that readers will be wondering why it's not here. Fyunck(click) (talk) 05:11, 15 July 2015 (UTC)\nWell, long ago it was decided within this project that all streaks should only be added when they ended. But if some of the project are against this consensus now, it should be okay to add this Serena Slam and others active streaks by now. ABC paulista (talk) 01:19, 16 July 2015 (UTC)\nI don't recall it exactly, and I can see some sense if that's the case. 40 matches in a row... they'll soon be on their way to winning or losing the next match. But a streak of major tournament victories... there are only 4 of them. I'm not sure if that's what we were talking about when deciding not to add a streak. I'd have to see the original discussion and the reasoning behind it. For all I know I was apart of it. :-) Fyunck(click) (talk) 01:28, 16 July 2015 (UTC)\n\nThree Majors\n@Fyunck(click): The \"UR\" that I used in that table means \"Unknown Result\", which I used to describe players whose results in those tournaments couldn't be found (whenever they lost at the QF, SF, 3R, etc, I couldn't find their results and/or draws), or is unknown even if they took part of the competition or not. Or we find the Roland-Garros and US Open results somewhere, or it would be wise to include \"UR\" in the Key. ABC paulista (talk) 20:04, 22 September 2015 (UTC)\n\nI put a note under the table. I'm not sure the key needs being altered as I've not come across a need in the past.

I will copy their letter to me in full here (minus the salutations & personal pleasantries), for all who are curious.  In sum, the ITF never intended to change the traditional definition of a Grand Slam in 1982; rather, this has been a decades-long misunderstanding perpetuated by members of the tennis media--some of whom did, in fact, vote in their professional organizations to change the definition.  Sadly, the Wikipedia entry has contributed to this confusion. Hopefully, that ends now.\n\"I should start by pointing out that information on the Grand Slam in the ITF Constitution has always been as an Appendix, so information rather than rule or regulation (ie Article or Bye-law). Separately under Bye-laws, Grand Slam tournaments are listed as Official Tennis Championships of the ITF together with what this entails.\nThe amount of information on the Grand Slam included as an Appendix in the ITF Constitution has varied over the years, but in 2011 the ITF Constitutional Committee determined that the existing wording in the Constitution left ambiguity so proposed the current text as clarification, starting with the 2012 ITF Constitution.\nI can confirm that Navratilova was the only player to receive a $1 million bonus for winning four consecutive majors.\"  This is an email from Nick Imison of the ITF (dated 12/12/2016).  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 100.15.192.246 (talk) 00:28, 14 December 2016 (UTC) \n\nThat would be inadmissible original research. Fyunck(click) (talk) 07:09, 14 December 2016 (UTC)\nThat’s fine; I didn’t end up needing to cite the ITF statement. You obviously don’t need my permission to look over & edit the changes I made to the section, including a new sub-heading, \"Controversy over terminology.\" I probably included too much information &/or quotations about the 1980s controversy, but I figured it was better to be thorough on a first go and let someone else trim as he/she sees fit.\n\nNCGS vs. CGS\n@Fyunck(click): I strongly disagree with your editing about the ones that achieved a Non-calendar year Grand Slam (NCGS). I believe that only the ones who did that without achieving a Calendar Grand Slam (CGS) should be added here. First, on the table that shows the ones that achieved a CGS there's already these streaks info, so there is no need to present this info again. Second, this section is about Non-calendar year Grand Slam chievers, not Slam wins' streaks. Third, adding them can cause some confusion for the reader about their differences and definitions, mantaining them separed would help consolidating their definitions better. Fourth, a CGS is a more noteworthy and coveted achievement than NCGS for many people, so in cases where both are acheived the NCGS one shoud be secondary. Fifth, how should the NCGS be counted? A streak should count as one NCGS regardless the amount of slam wins in a row, or from four titles and beyond a new one should also count as a additional NCGS? Should a CGS also be counted as a NCGS? Adding them would raise these questions and others.\nAlso @Fyunck(click):, you were very inconsistent with your additons: Why you only added Budge, Court and Collonly? What about Graf's 1988-89 5-Slam streak? What about the doubles ones? Why you didn't added everyone that was on the Grand Slam Winners' table? This kind of inconsistency is very misleading and plain wrong. ABC paulista (talk) 21:42, 14 December 2016 (UTC)\n\nI'm not sure why you wouldn't have all players that won a NCGS. The section says nothing about limiting it. There is also very misleading writing in the sentence \"On the men's side, Novak Djokovic is the only singles player to accomplish the non-calendar year Grand Slam during the Open Era, winning all four majors between Wimbledon 2015 and the 2016 French Open.\" That really makes it sound like he completed something no one else had, when Laver did it even better in the Open Era. It's very fuzzy sounding to me. It's like saying \"John is the only player in history to win 2 consecutive marbles titles\", when 37 other players have won 8,9, and 10 in a row. And if this isn't about the number they won in a row, then we need to remove the extra sentences about how many each player won in a row and only list the events that completed their non-calendar slam. It also needs to clearly say that this list excludes all those whose non-calendar Grand Slams overlap a Grand Slam. Fyunck(click) (talk) 22:52, 14 December 2016 (UTC)\nI went with your logic but made it crystal clear what this list is for, while also toning down the Djokovic acheivement.

Second, I'm sorry, I saw that wrong. I thought that you eliminated the 1951 Wimbledon by accident instead of the 1952 one. But don't worry, it'll be reverted. ABC paulista (talk) 17:41, 10 November 2019 (UTC)\n@ABC paulista: And what about Ivan Lendl's supposed streak of 4 consecutive finals appearances? I am sure, I was right deleting that. The timeline is like this: 1985 US Open (CH) -> 1985 Australian Open (SF) -> 1986 French Open (CH) -> 1986 Wimbledon (RU) -> 1986 US Open (CH). There was not Australian Open in January 1986, but there was one in December 1985. Best regards.Borucic (talk) 18:15, 10 November 2019 (UTC)\n@Borucic: The ping didin't work again, because you added the sign on a later edit, and pinging only work it it's used on the sameedit where the sign is also added. About Lendl, yes it seems that you're right again. ABC paulista (talk) 18:25, 10 November 2019 (UTC)\n\nMultiple Career Grand Slam Titles - Women's Doubles\nHingis should be listed in order ahead of Serena & Venus since her first came in 1998?\nSquashEngineer (talk) 22:23, 28 January 2019 (UTC)\n\nIt's apparently sorted by the last career grand slam. It's the same with the other categories. Please don't add <br> after section headings. It breaks the syntax. PrimeHunter (talk) 22:48, 28 January 2019 (UTC)\n@PrimeHunter:  Accepted response - close issue.  SquashEngineer (talk) 16:06, 23 October 2020 (UTC)\n\nCareer Grand Slam - Women's Doubles - Individual\nI don't understand the value in the table numbering system, from 1 to 20, when there are 21 individual winners, and the skipping of numbers for the pairings.  This table is for individual accomplishment - the pairings, while noteworthy, do not contribute to the # of overall individuals.  The numbering could go sequentially from 1 to 21, without gaps, and simply indicate the pairings through some other means (table boarder font for example).SquashEngineer (talk) 14:38, 29 July 2019 (UTC)\n\nIn this table the possible pairings weren't lumped together on purpose. What happens is that, sometimes, some players won the career slam at the same time, on the same tournament, because they played said tournament together and won it. In these cases, since they are \"tied\" on this criteria, we can't arbitrarily decide who won the career slam first, and no other criteria seems able to objectively order it, so it's better to lump such cases together. So, in these cases, what the tables are saying is that: \"Player A and Player B were the (N)th and (N+1)th ones to achieve the career slam\".

SquashEngineer (talk) 16:28, 23 October 2020 (UTC)\n\nCareer Boxed Sets\nIts annoying that the columns of the two tables in this section are not aligned.  It makes it difficult to see where Margaret almost accomplishes three independent boxed sets.\nSquashEngineer (talk) 22:39, 28 January 2019 (UTC)\nMay I propose this?\n1. Change her name to Margaret Smith Court in the first table.\n2. Change the \"Open Era table\" accordingly:\n\nIf someone thinks it's worth it - here's my finding/proposal (please feel free to change this into a proper english sentence):\n\"Trivia: one can compose Court's career boxed set out of the titles won solely after her first boxed set was completed:\"\n\n--Borucic (talk) 19:59, 10 November 2019 (UTC)\n\nAnd what's your reasoning for these changes? ABC paulista (talk) 20:12, 10 November 2019 (UTC)\nad 1. Quote from SquashEngineer: \"Its annoying that the columns of the two tables in this section are not aligned.\" - One can make it perfectly aligned this way. Borucic (talk) 21:09, 10 November 2019 (UTC)\nArtificially aligning the columns that way is undesired. Per WP:NAME, we should always stick to the name that a person is most commonly referred as, and people rarely use the surname Smith for her. ABC paulista (talk) 21:29, 10 November 2019 (UTC)\nad 2. Like I said - if such an accomplishment is not worth it, one doesn't have to publish this information.  Borucic (talk) 21:09, 10 November 2019 (UTC)\nSince the Open Era division is a very important one for tennis, I believe that the current second table contains a noteworthy info. Also, your replacement proposal is already covered in the first table, that cites the two independent bexed sets that she achieved. ABC paulista (talk) 21:29, 10 November 2019 (UTC)\n@ABC paulista: The second table is good to highlight the open era.  I would still like to see the alignment of the columns with the first table for the purpose of comparing the span of years that Court was able to accomplish her Boxed Sets.  It does not need to involve artificially lengthening her name.  It simply needs a similar column added for \"Boxed Sets.\"  The number for Court in that column could be \"1.\"  In addition, a note could be added below the second table, noting (similar to Hingis and King) that she narrowly missed a 3rd career box set by only one further win at Wimbeldon Doubles - the original point of my initial edit request. SquashEngineer (talk) 16:28, 23 October 2020 (UTC)\nSquashEngineer, remember to sign all your comments, the ping doesn't work without it. About this issue, I'm against adding another column for the open era since Court's one was the only instance of a boxed set in the open era, thus adding as column to quantify it would be redundant, failing conciseness. I'm also against adding such note because she did achieve the boxed set, so the fact that she was unable to achieve subsequent boxed sets isn't as notable as the fact that someone fell short of achieving their first one. It's just not noteworthy enough. ABC paulista (talk) 21:55, 23 October 2020 (UTC)\n@ABC paulista:  Now that I look at the article as a whole, I wonder why ALL the tables with similar columns aren't all aligned with the same column widths, from top to bottom of the article. It may look cleaner overall IMHO. SquashEngineer (talk) 16:28, 23 October 2020 (UTC)\n\nSquashEngineer, there's a way to set the columns in predetermined sizes, but I'm not good at it. It's a pain to properly adjust it, a time-consuming trial-and-error process. If you wanna test it out, go for it. ABC paulista (talk) 21:55, 23 October 2020 (UTC)\n\nCareer Grand Slams - Women's Doubles - Team\nI don't understand why the Williams Sisters are listed as a collective item rather than just there names (in brackets) like all the other pairings in the table.\nSquashEngineer (talk) 21:21, 28 January 2019 (UTC)\n\n@SquashEngineer: You refer to Grand Slam (tennis)#Team 2. \"Williams sisters\" is followed by individual links to Serena Williams and Venus Williams. It's the only of the listed female teams which has a team article. It would be odd not to link it in a table specifically about teams. The male table at Grand Slam (tennis)#Team uses the same format for Bryan brothers and The Woodies. The three linked teams are the only ones in Category:Tennis doubles teams. PrimeHunter (talk) 21:35, 28 January 2019 (UTC)\n@PrimeHunter: Why do they need to be identified as brothers and sisters.  We all know that by their names.  Can't they simply be listed as a doubles team by name, like all the others?SquashEngineer (talk) 22:31, 28 January 2019 (UTC)\n@SquashEngineer: We want to link relevant Wikipedia articles. A team article is relevant when the team is mentioned. A link needs text to click on. Blue text means a link in case you don't know. Williams sisters is the common name when they are mentioned together so we use that for article title and link text. It's possible to make a piped link to change the link text but I see no reason for that. Doubles partners with the same surname don't have to be siblings but usually are. PrimeHunter (talk) 22:48, 28 January 2019 (UTC)\n@SquashEngineer: The Woodies aren't siblings. Feliciano López and Marc López aren't either. ABC paulista (talk) 22:58, 28 January 2019 (UTC)\n@ABC paulista:  I was referring to the Bryan brothers as the other example. SquashEngineer (talk) 16:02, 23 October 2020 (UTC)\nSquashEngineer I was referring to the statement \"Why do they need to be identified as brothers and sisters.  We all know that by their names.\" Sharing the same surname doesn't mean that the players are siblings. The \"brothers and sisters\" identification is how their respective articles are named, because that's how their pairing are more commonly referred as, so per WP:NAME, that's how they should be identified here. ABC paulista (talk) 15:04, 24 October 2020 (UTC)\n@PrimeHunter:  Accepted response - close issue.  SquashEngineer (talk) 16:02, 23 October 2020 (UTC)\n\nThe article is too long\nThere are too many tables and too many subsections on this page. My head hurts scrolling through all the tables with all the names and the different colors. I think most of what's in this article can be moved and redirected to the discipline articles. For example, the first section 'Grand Slam completion' can be remade to look like this.\n\nGrand Slam completion\nIn terms of the current four majors, the first to win all four in a single year was Don Budge, who completed the feat in 1938. To date, 17 players have completed a Grand Slam, though only six in the most prestigious singles titles. Of these players, three have won multiple majors: Rod Laver accomplished the feat twice in men's singles; Margaret Court accomplished the feat three times, in two different disciplines – once in women's singles and twice in mixed doubles; and Esther Vergeer completed a grand slam twice in Women's wheelchair doubles. The four Junior disciplines, boys' and girls' singles and doubles, provide limited opportunities to achieve a Grand Slam. Players are only eligible from age 13 to 18, with 18-year-olds likely to hold a physical advantage. Only Stefan Edberg has completed the Grand Slam in a Junior discipline.\n\nMen's Singles \nWomen's Singles (not there yet) \nMen's Doubles (not there yet) \nWomen's Doubles (not there yet) \nMixed Doubles (not there yet) \n\nThe same can be done with some of the other sections (Non-calendar Grand Slam, Career Grand Slam and Multiple Career Grand Slam). What do you think? --ForzaUV (talk) 14:01, 10 June 2021 (UTC)\n\nForzaUV What sections would be moved, and what would stay? I fear that, by doing so, this article would be too empty to justify its existance. ABC paulista (talk) 16:17, 11 June 2021 (UTC)\nAre there probably too many tables? Yes. But I do not think that most of this article should be moved to proper disciplines.  This article augments other articles but is more specific in nature. It talks about controversial meanings, different varieties, streaks, etc. Now, some of the charts here basically tell you the same thing in a different format, or a combined format. That should not happen. Trim=yes. Fyunck(click) (talk) 22:30, 11 June 2021 (UTC)\nABC paulista, I think you've got me wrong. I'm not saying the sections should be moved, they should stay as they are, it's just the sections' lists (tables) are what should be moved to their discipline pages, the Calendar Grand Slam, Non-Calendar Slam, Career Slam and Multiple Career Slam lists in specific. See the Grand Slam completion section above, it's there but not the lists, the section includes the wikilinks to the lists instead. Nothing changes with the lists which are across all disciplines (Triple Crown, Boxed Set etc) as this is the proper article for them. The other option, we start trimming as Fyunck suggested. Those sections about Three Majors in a year or Finals appearance for example could be removed, maybe. --ForzaUV (talk) 14:30, 12 June 2021 (UTC)\nForzaUV, so if I'm getting your proposal right, all sections that have divided subsections based on each discipline would be moved, but the ones that aggregates all disciplines together would stay? If so, I think I can agree. ABC paulista (talk) 15:59, 12 June 2021 (UTC)\nGreat. Just one thing, all sections that have divided subsections based on each discipline would be moved only the subsections (lists/tables) would be moved not the sections themselves. Let's see if Fyunck can agree as well. ForzaUV (talk) 17:30, 12 June 2021 (UTC)\nI think I'd need to see it. Could you delete (without moving yet) the sections you don't think are relevant? Maybe put it on your sandbox so we could see what won't be here anymore. Fyunck(click) (talk) 17:52, 12 June 2021 (UTC)\nYou can see it on my sandbox. --ForzaUV (talk) 03:18, 13 June 2021 (UTC)\nOn first look I think that is way too much left on the cutting room floor. This is a Grand Slam article and there is no better place than here for some of these charts. Take the current Grand Slam completion section. That chronological chart is great. The per player chart not so much. What happens to the near miss three majors in a year charts, or the 4 finals in a year charts? Is there a link to those? Maybe we first have to decide which charts are useless and which help our readers, and then figure out a re-order. Fyunck(click) (talk) 04:18, 13 June 2021 (UTC)\n Ok, how about this\nWe keep the CYGS first chart and NCYGS charts, just a few changes to save space and improve readability.\nThe Career and Multiple Career Slam charts should certainly be moved. They are too many and fairly long. I think we can reduce the size of the page by 1/3 just by moving those.\nThree majors in a year and the 4 finals in a year stay as they are but those consecutive titles and finals sections should just be removed. They belong to the Open Era and All-time records pages.\nEverything else stay the same with the addition of one chart for the Grand Slam titles totals across all disciplines. ForzaUV (talk) 08:04, 13 June 2021 (UTC)\nThat sounds better. Can we see the new version again in the sandbox before we change things? Fyunck(click) (talk) 08:13, 13 June 2021 (UTC)\nGood. What do you want to see exactly? The article will be the same, except those lists of the CGS and Multi-CGS will be moved and the sections of consecutive titles/finals removed. If it's about the changes I mentioned in the first point, I'm working on them now. ForzaUV (talk) 01:13, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\nI've just published the changes, if there anything you don't like, try to fix it or let me know here and I will see what I can do. ForzaUV (talk) 03:11, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\nBut I really liked seeing the Grand Slams as they were won chronologically. That chart didn't really need fixing. Fyunck(click) (talk) 03:15, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\nI don't think the chronological order is that important here tbh. Grouping them by discipline is the way to go imho, makes it easier for readers to find the info they're looking for. ForzaUV (talk) 03:27, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\nBut those are simply different opinions held by us. For me that chart is really useful. Fyunck(click) (talk) 05:32, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\nWe can do both simultaneously, we have sortable tables for cases as such. But I personally really dislike the format where Pre-Open era instances come after the Open era ones, when both are sorted chronologically. IMO, it makes even more confusing to the reader than the current format. ABC paulista (talk) 16:33, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\nWell, maybe they shouldn't be grouped by era even though I prefer it that way but they should certainly be grouped by discipline. How it's done now is just not right, the names can be sorted chronologically within the discipline group. Merging different disciplines and classes makes no sense and I've never seen it anywhere else. ForzaUV (talk) 17:23, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\nWe have article charts that list both mens and womens accomplishments merged together. There is nothing wrong with having the chart in question... I find it very useful. One thing I was told early on at Wikipedia is that we do not use a cookie-cutter for our articles. Each article can be unique in what they present to our readers. I find this particular chart cool and informative. I do like chronological charts to see the prgression of accomplishments. Could it be done slightly different, sure, but I see nothing wrong with it the way it is now. You could start an RfC and see if editors want it removed entirely. Maybe everyone but the creator and me hates it. That's happened before. But also realize that the chart as it stands, starts off sorted by year with the ability to sort by discipline. It could stay \"identical\" except it could start off sorted chronologically by discipline. Then I can always sort it by year to get same chart we see today. Not my choice, but it is a compromise I could live with as long as no other changes are made to it. Fyunck(click) (talk) 18:30, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\nI didn't see my changes as removing the chart entirely. It's basically the same exact chart but grouped by discipline as it should be. The chronological order of accomplishments is also there, but within the discipline group. Laver is said to be the second player to complete the Grand Slam and the first in the Open Era, never heard or read he was the fifth. Could anyone here link  one source where winners of different disciplines and classes listed this way? There are maybe charts in Wikipedia where men's and women's accomplishments merged but it would be Singles → Doubles → Wheelchair. The list as it is now makes no sense to me, it's like listing the winners of FIFA World Cup, Women's World Cup, Futsal World Cup and U-20 World Cup in one chronological list and claiming it's useful and informative when in reality it's really not. ForzaUV (talk) 19:21, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\nNot even close to the same thing. These are not tournaments winners. These are people who play at the exact same event, and the same sport, who have achieved a rare accomplishment. There are not 100s of championship winners to list. This type of table happens with Wikipedia events. This Olympic medal table lists Gold winners across all disciplines. The Tennis at the Pan American Games uses a similar chart. So a particular tennis article can't have one? This chronological table has a heck of a lot less people who have accomplished the winning a Grand Slam. Fyunck(click) (talk) 22:20, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\n@Fyunck(click): Come on, man. Olympics charts really? Those don’t help your argument at all. Olympics charts are about nations and medals, so not only that disciplines, classes, genders are merged, even the sports themselves are merged. Anyways, let’s keep the discussion about the chart layout for another time. The whole point of the discussion here is to have the article at a reasonable size and length, so do you have any objection to the other points? Point 2 and 3 in particular? Pinging ABC paulista as well, same question. ForzaUV (talk) 08:03, 16 June 2021 (UTC)\nOne could argue that Tennis is different from other sports in the sense that, although the tours are separated by genre, many tournaments hold both disciplines simultaneously, that being even truer when regarding the biggest ones, like the majors and masters. Very few sports do that. ABC paulista (talk) 23:26, 16 June 2021 (UTC)\n\nI don't see much problem in sorting per era, but I also don't see much benefit from it, especially when we deal with achievements that span both eras (some Career Slams, like BJK's singles' one, for example). But if we are gonna sort per era, we should do either \"from oldest to youngest with Pre-Open Era instances coming before Open Era ones\", or \"from youngest to oldest with Pre-Open Era instances coming after Open Era ones\". The way you proposed, \"from oldest to youngest with Pre-Open Era instances coming after Open Era ones\" (like this and this one) is very counterintuitive. I don't mind much the table being sorted per discipline, but I'm against splitting it for each discipline, I don't think that there's enough content to warrant such move. And going further, I think that all NCYGS instances should be merged into a single table, there's just too few instances for each discipline to have their own subsection. ABC paulista (talk) 22:38, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\n\nIt’s not about youngest or oldest. Open Era achievements are considered more significant, there is more weight to them compared to the amateur era achievements. I think you’d agree that Djokovic DCGS for example is rated higher than Emerson’s DCGS. but I'm against splitting it for each discipline, I don't think that there's enough content to warrant such move., sorry, what do you mean here, moving what exactly? As for the NCYGS instances being merged into one chart, there is no disagreement about this one. ForzaUV (talk) 07:50, 16 June 2021 (UTC)\nI guess it depends on who you are talking to and the discipline. Womens Open vs Pre-Open is pretty much the same... Alice Marble maybe being the exception as she would have won a few more. And it's only some modern invention that makes a dcgs anything. Emerson put most of his marbles into Davis Cup... it's the reason he wouldn't turn pro. I'd put both of Laver's Grand Slams above anything Djokovic has done, but it's different eras where different things are more important. I personally dislike splitting the eras in charts, and I would agree that we should always strive to do things chronologically with the pre-open era first. Fyunck(click) (talk) 09:03, 16 June 2021 (UTC)\n@ForzaUV: In that phrase, I meant that I don't think that splitting a table, like the CYGS and NCYGS ones, into various individuals per each discipline would work well, since currently there's too few instances of each. A single table could be sorted per discipline, but not divided. About the era's divisions, I don't think I personally agree with such weighting, but I know some specialists do have such view, although we should be wary of cases of recency bias. So I think that either dividing them here or not are both valid options, but should we opt to divide them and give the lead to the Open era instances, I do belive that we should strive to mantain a chronological order overall, since that's still a possibility. Putting the Open era instances before the Pre-Open era ones while sorting them from oldest to youngest is incoherent. ABC paulista (talk) 23:26, 16 June 2021 (UTC)\nRecent bias is a problem with many sports. Tennis is no exception with the press wrongly and constantly projecting CEIB.... \"Current Era Is best.\" Fyunck(click) (talk) 23:32, 16 June 2021 (UTC)\n\nProposed split\nI think this article mixes two separate concepts - the tournaments, and the achievement of winning all four of them. I understand it because I'm familiar with tennis, but I'd imagine that unfamiliar readers would be confused as they'd have been linked to the article in one of the two different contexts. I think we should split the article into Grand Slam (tennis) (the tournament class and clear primary topic), and Grand Slam (tennis achievement), where we would have the history of + all the tables for calendar year/career etc. Grand Slams (or link to the tables in the separate disciplines' articles as is done in the sandboxed proposal above). The former would be equivalent to Major professional tennis tournaments before the Open Era, except it would be shorter as we would link all the lists of champions. This would make things clear for readers new to tennis. —Somnifuguist (talk) 07:37, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\n\nSurvey\nSupport as nom. —Somnifuguist (talk) 07:37, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nOppose - As I read what was actually being proposed here in the discussion section, I see the nominator wants to remove all aspects of winning a Grand Slam (all four majors in the same year) from this article. Gutting the historically accurate and heavily used terminology from a Grand Slam article seems like one of the silliest ideas I've ever heard. It's one thing to do some trimming, but I'm in shock this would be proposed. Fyunck(click) (talk) 19:34, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nSneering responses such as this to good-faith proposals to improve the encyclopedia for readers are strongly discouraged. —Somnifuguist (talk) 20:41, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nNothing sneering about it. I am in shock this was even proposed once I understood the full purpose in the discussion section. I couldn't oppose this more strongly. Fyunck(click) (talk) 20:49, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nYour opinion is welcome, but not with statements like \"...seems like one of the silliest ideas I've ever heard\", which is textbook belittlement—see WP:Civility#Identifying incivility section 1.(d)—part of a policy, not a guideline. —Somnifuguist (talk) 21:14, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nIf someone proposed taking George Washington's early life or military career out of the George Washington article, I would probably use even stronger words than silly. That's how I feel about the term Grand Slam. Fyunck(click) (talk) 21:24, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nNot at all an equivalent scenario, but yes you would be wrong to do so then as well. —Somnifuguist (talk) 22:35, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nOppose - I feel that there's too little information on the tournaments themselves to justify such splitting. This article is almost fully concentrated on the achievements, so a proposed sole article for the achievement would still suffer from too much info, and the tournaments' one would have too little to justify its existance. ABC paulista (talk) 21:56, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nOppose - I feel all the information should be listed on one page.  It should be possible to trim this article and still retain the relevant information contained within it, but I don't agree with splitting the article into two. Tennishistory1877 (talk) 23:06, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nOppose I highly oppose this. The very thought that anyone would even think of splitting one of the most fundamentally important tennis articles, especially about grand slams, sickens me. Somnigiguist, I respect you as a tennis wiki editor and I can tell you are passionate about improving things, but, my god, have some decency to preserve the standards of tennisnon wikipedia, man. Like, come on. Why would split a perfectly good article. Why? Just because it seems too long and you want it \"trimmed\" into 2 articles? No. Highly disagree. And I am sure the others see tue obvious issue with this unnecessary inane proposal. I know I am going out of line. But I felt the need to state my opinion on the matter. And so, here it is. Qwerty284651 (talk) 23:37, 20 June 2021 (UTC)\nI enjoyed reading this, but in future, challenging the basis of a proposal (clarity is my primary concern here, not length), not attacking its proponents, is necessary if you want your argument to hold any weight. —Somnifuguist (talk) 07:48, 21 June 2021 (UTC)\nSupport (Conditionally) - I believe that certain sections could easily be moved to List of Grand Slam related tennis records; like \"#13) Three major titles in one year\" which really is a list of people that \"missed\" getting a slam.  Section \"14 Four major tournament finals in a year\" - admittedly small, showing how rare it is, but again a listing of BOTH those that DID get it and those that did not... (Maybe not on the \"primary\" page?).  I have a hard time distinguishing the different \"achievement\" from \"#10 Most Grand Slam titles across all disciplines\" in a year and \"#15 Triple Crown winners\"? - so, maybe a \"consolidation\" is in order?  Though Section 9 \"Most consecutive GS singles finals\" should be a separate page for each \"event\" shouldn't it? Finally, as a person that \"reads\" these out-loud as part of Spoken Wikipedia...Beyond the lede, Can you imagine what this would \"sound\" like? Mjquinn_id (talk) 14:37, 25 June 2021 (UTC)\nSupport per nom. As has been discussed, the concept of a Grand Slam tournament is separate from the achievement of winning all four Grand Slam tournaments. Golf already has separate articles for these concepts; tennis should as well. The fact that it would be an uneven split isn't a concern. The reason for the split has nothing to do with the length of this article; it's entirely because we shouldn't have an article that covers two separate concepts. Sportsfan77777 (talk) 17:18, 10 July 2021 (UTC)\n\nDiscussion\nSo it seems that \"Grand Slam (tennis)\" would be nothing but prose? We'd keep the exact same lead, same origin and history sections, a list of the four majors, and that's it? Then we'd have to repeat some of that same prose in a \"Grand Slam (tennis achievement)\" article. Is this the proposal as I understand it? Fyunck(click) (talk) 08:13, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\n\nI envisioned it as including the prose definition for the tournaments from the lede, the table Grand Slam (tennis)#Tournaments and the links to the lists of champions Grand Slam (tennis)#Grand Slam tournament champions as a start. From the lede, the first two paragraphs are relevant to the tournaments, the third the achievement. In the history section, the first two paragraphs are relevant to the achievement, the third to the tournaments. The origin section doesn't even mention when the term \"Grand Slam\" transitioned to being used for the majors themselves, so that section needs work either way, but probably there would be some overlap in the split articles for that section, yes. More prose could definitely be written about the tournaments- expanding info about the transition to the open era from the pro, adding info about the changing of surfaces and speeds at the slams, the equalizing of prize money for men and women, adding wheelchair events etc. We could move the content over from History of tennis#The Four Majors, as that covers a lot of it. —Somnifuguist (talk) 08:46, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nWell, this article would certainly need to keep the full explanation in the lead of a Grand Slam being the winning of all four majors in the same tennis season. You can't pull that from the article and stick it somewhere else. It would be a gaping hole. I can't see cutting the lead at all. It seems like this article would be sparse and the achievement article would be about the same length. I'm for thinning down but not for gutting it. Fyunck(click) (talk) 09:55, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nNo \"gutting\" is being proposed, just splitting an article covering two separate concepts with the same name into two separate articles. If we split the career/golden/calendar year/... Grand Slam info into a separate article (as proposed), we could just link to it in the origin section with {{main|...}}, and in the lede with {{about|...}}, e.g.:\nThis article is about the tennis tournaments, for the achievement of winning all four of them in the same year, see Grand Slam (tennis achievement)\nBoth uses of \"Grand Slam\" would be covered appropriately in their own articles, so there would be no \"gaping hole\"s in Wikipedia's coverage of them. Or do you not agree that the article as it stands covers two different ideas, and that that is confusing for readers?  —Somnifuguist (talk) 11:05, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nIt is only confusing in the way that Websters covers multiple meanings of words in the same definition. In tennis, Grand Slam has two distinct meanings. That is what this article covers. Both are in heavy use by the press, historians, magazines, etc...  To not cover both meanings in this topic seems outlandish to me. If that is what the proposal would do, I would be very much against it. There is a reason why Tennis Project uses the term \"Major\" or \"Grand Slam tournament\" when talking about one the events that make up a Grand Slam. Djokovic, having just won the French, is already talking about winning a Grand Slam plus the Olympics. He's an amazing player and the press is gonna eat up on it. You might as well move everything out of this article that concerns the four Majors into an article called the \"Grand Slam tennis tournaments.\" But I would opposed that too for the same reasons. Fyunck(click) (talk) 19:28, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nPlease read WP:Splitting#Content split, and more generally WP:Disambiguation. On Wikipedia, if two concepts share a name but are distinct, we create separate pages for them, and disambiguate their titles. We don't share an article for multiple concepts just because they share the same name, even if they are related. Wikipedia is unlike a dictionary in that way. Here's a perfectly analogous situation to what I'm proposing: we have Grand Slam (golf), which is about the achievement of winning all four golf majors, and Men's major golf championships, which is about the majors themselves. The only difference in tennis is that the term \"Grand Slam\" has bled over from its original meaning to cover the tournaments themselves, whether purists like it or not. My proposed namings were only a suggestion; if Major (tennis) and Grand Slam (tennis) (or Grand Slam (tennis tournament) as you suggested) were preferred, that would be fine with me as well. However, \"Grand Slam\" is more commonly used for the individual tournaments than \"major\" nowadays, which is why I suggested two disambiguated \"Grand Slam\" titles instead. —Somnifuguist (talk) 21:02, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nNow some 90/10 split of this article doesn't help at all. But if it was more like 60/40 we could move the contents of this article to \"Grand Slam (tennis achievement)\" and \"Grand Slam (tennis majors)\" or perhaps \"Grand Slam tennis tournaments\" so we wouldn't need parenthesis. Then take the resulting \"Grand Slam (tennis)\" and make it a redirect to the Grand Slam disambiguation section on tennis. Would that be satisfactory? Because we use the (tennis) parameter to encompass all things with the preceding term. Grand Slam for an individual tournament is more common today, but I hear Major all the time in interviews. Usually it's more like \"Grand Slam tournaments.\" I don't use the term myself for an individual event unless I'm trying to explain things to administrators here, it's aways the four tennis majors for me. Fyunck(click) (talk) 21:24, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nYes I understand why major is the more correct term. If you're suggesting making \"Grand Slam (tennis)\" a disamb page, then I would agree with that. I proposed keeping it about the tournaments as the primary topic, but it's reasonable to dispute that. The \"Grand Slam (tennis achievement)\" and \"Grand Slam tennis tournament\" titles work for me. The 90/10 split is irrelevant, what matters is that we clear up the terms for readers. You can see a rough draft for the article about the majors in my sandbox. Besides, as I wrote before, much can be added about the majors including content from History of tennis#The Four Majors, and the Grand Slam/Golden Slam/etc. tables are going to be trimmed/moved to the individual discipline pages (as proposed above), so the end result of the split and that work would be two reasonably-sized and well-defined articles. Another example: Grand Slam (NASCAR) (achievement), NASCAR Cup Series (tournaments). —Somnifuguist (talk) 22:35, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nIf the split is made alongside the content move to each discipline's pages, then almost no content would be left for the proper achievement's article. I feel that we either split the articles or move the tables, both would be too much. ABC paulista (talk) 23:47, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nWe would end up with two articles whose summed length would be shorter than the current article, but that's not saying much—the current article is monolithic and very difficult to navigate even as an experienced editor using a desktop. —Somnifuguist (talk) 10:19, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\nI feel like that more info regarding the tournaments should be added here before justifying shuch move. As it stands now, the article is almost solely focused on the achievement. There justo too little content regarding the tournaments, it could be easily merged into other articles without much loss or problems. ABC paulista (talk) 21:56, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nThat does make sense. If we add some material/prose on the four tournaments, and it gets unwieldy, perhaps a split could work. I'll look a little harder at the prose and see if more can be added to augment what we already have. Certainly the achievement section is more than adequate as is. Fyunck(click) (talk) 22:33, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nI disagree. If you see my sandboxed proposal for the majors' article, it's more than an adequate start—far longer than most new articles created here daily. Again, this article currently conflates two separate concepts. It'll be easier to work on expanding and improving our coverage of these separate concepts if we separate them. I see no benefit in delaying it if you're both not disagreeing with the premise of the split itself. —Somnifuguist (talk) 22:46, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nWe are disagreeing right now. Don't split it. Fyunck(click) (talk) 23:30, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nWe are, and the encyclopedia is worse for it. I don't need to be commanded when I've followed procedure to a tee, thanks. —Somnifuguist (talk) 10:19, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\nSomnifuguist Based on your draft, it's clear to me that the total amount of content about the tournaments contained here is stub-worthy, and I doubt that itself justifies a proper article for it own. I'm alsso don't agree that mere copypastes from other articles, to increase the amount of info on them here, would be desirable. Maybe, for a start, would be better to reorganize this arcticle to make the different concepts clearer for the readers, or maybe you should first to work on your draft, adding content into it, to better justify your proposal and for us to have more to work with. ABC paulista (talk) 23:41, 14 June 2021 (UTC)\nAgain, I disagree. The draft would be start class; this is a stub. I didn't propose copy-pasting content but moving it, and that was just an example to show that much more can be written about the slams as a group. I may continue work on the draft, thanks for your levelheadedness. —Somnifuguist (talk) 10:19, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\nI'm also not sure if there's enough content to be moved and make your proposed article to work, and I'm even less sure how much you can move from other articles without harming them. Again, it's better for you to show us what's your idea. ABC paulista (talk) 16:37, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\nWell, I think my draft already works as a start without needing any extra content. As I said, moving the content from History of tennis#The Four Majors was just an idea. The difference of opinion between myself and the \"Oppose\"rs seems to lie in whether \"Grand Slam\" as the type of tournament, and as the achievement of winning all 4 of them in a year are sufficiently separate concepts to require separate articles. If they are, then we must split the article as I've proposed. As I see it, the term is always used in one of the two different contexts; there is no in between. Now more than ever, when Djokovic is winning \"his 19th Grand Slam\" and attempting \"to clinch the Grand Slam\", I think it is important for Wikipedia to be clear and unambiguous on the difference, just like it already is for golf and NASCAR. A reader linked to the article in the achievement context will be confused by the first two paragraphs of the lede describing something else, and a reader linked in the tournament context will be confused by the marked lack of information and history about the tournaments that are the supposed pinnacle of the sport. Multiply this by 15,000 incoming links and a million pageviews a year and the result is a lot of confusion that could be easily avoided. But, I have expended enough words on this now, so will say no more. —Somnifuguist (talk) 18:38, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\nAt least from me, the only disagreement I have in this lies in the amount of content currently available for the subject regarding the tournaments. I don't think that such move would be beneficial until there's enough content for both subjects to have their own B-class articles each. And I do believe that we're able to properly separate the concepts within the same article, and that would have create benefits than a full split. Not always there is need to split concepts within a subject to make it clear that they are different things, words and proper article organization can do that with similar efficiency. ABC paulista (talk) 22:11, 15 June 2021 (UTC)\n\nThe Channel Slam\nABC paulista, I like what you have done with the Career Grand Slam sections but I see you also added a new section about the Channel Slam? Please don't re-add it. No need to include 'Anything Slam' to the article, maybe there is also some source in the internet about 'hardcourt slam' for winning AO and USO in the same year but we don't have to list everything here. At least the 'Three-Quarter Slam' and 'The Surface Slam' sections are about 3 out of the 4 tournaments so they could be interesting to some readers but those about only 2/4 should be kept to the records pages or players' achievements pages. Or just like Somnifuguist suggested, we start a new article for Grand Slam achievements where you can add whatever you want. This article is ridiculous even in its current state. --ForzaUV (talk) 15:36, 24 July 2021 (UTC)\n\nForzaUV I'm intent to add it as long as it's seen as a notable achievement by reliable sources and it is related to the Grand Slam achievement. The presentd sources stated that the Roland Garros-Wimbledon combination is more noteworthy than others and that for me is sufficient for their inclusion here. Honestly, I would argue that the \"Three-Quarter Slam\" is the one cited here with the least amount of credibility on it, and I could see it being removed first. I wouldn't agree, but I would understand. Actually, between the \"Channel Slam\", the \"Surface Slam\" and the \"Three-Quarter Slam\", the \"Channel slam\" seem to be the most recognized and noted of the three. ABC paulista (talk) 15:47, 24 July 2021 (UTC)\nWhat's the point of the records and achievements pages then? This page should not be about all kinds of achievements. We have also other per discipline articles which can be expanded as you want. --ForzaUV (talk) 16:03, 24 July 2021 (UTC)\n\nI don't know what \"records and achievements pages\" you are talking about, but these achievements aren't bound by a specific discipline, but it is related to the Grand Slam achievement. This page is about the Grand Slam and all its noteworthy related achievements and subjects, and these 3 fit the criteria. These pages you cited are specific to their respective discipline, and they should only contain info pertinent to them. ABC paulista (talk) 16:16, 24 July 2021 (UTC)\nAgree, broadly, with ForzaUV. Three quarter/Channel/Surface slams are not notable enough. // Hippo43 (talk) 18:24, 24 July 2021 (UTC)\nHe isn't disputing the notability of such achievements, but arguing that here isn't the proper place to cite them. ABC paulista (talk) 19:04, 24 July 2021 (UTC)\nThat's not how I read his comment, but he can answer for himself. // Hippo43 (talk) 21:20, 24 July 2021 (UTC)\nJust my own input on an item. My long life has seen many items talked about in the history of the press along with historians and sports commentators. No one ever talks about a \"3/4 Slam.\" I have never seen that term, though it may exist. Sure they have talked about winning 3 of the 4 majors being an incredible feat, but they don't call it the 3/4 Slam. The \"Surface Slam\" is also pretty un-notable in the history of tennis. Probably because it was only achievable since the late 1970s when there were only two surfaces, except when we had a World Covered Court Championship that was played on wood. But the \"Channel Slam\" I hear all the time. It was used a lot in the time of Bjorn Borg, when he kept winning it over and over. But the commentators use it regularly today. Clay to Grass is still quite tough, though not like it used to be before they tried to equalize all surfaces. Of all of them, Channel Slam absolutely needs to be here in it's own section. Fyunck(click) (talk) 22:43, 26 July 2021 (UTC)\n\nTournaments of Super Slam\nAccording to the Guinness World Records Super Slam also includes the Davis Cup (Fed Cup/ BJK Cup), along with a Grand Slam and YEC. Kacir 00:50, 28 July 2021 (UTC)\n\nDo you have any other sources using this same definition? Sports Illustrated was the one who invented the term, and the don't consider the World Cups on it, and the majority of the sources presented seem to agree with it. ABC paulista (talk) 02:31, 28 July 2021 (UTC)\nNo, I was just a little surprised by that reliable source, imho, contains this information, again here. Cheers. Kacir 06:12, 28 July 2021 (UTC)\nHowever, I can find the terminology in no other sources. None. It would be interesting to ask Guinness where they got their data, or did they just make it up. It's hard enough to ever see the term \"super slam\" outside of golf. What's interesting is the WTA honored Martina Navratilova on April 17, 2003, for winning the first Open Era \"Career Super Slam.\" But it was for winning singles, doubles, and mixed doubles at all four Major tournaments... what we would call a \"career boxed set\" today. It was also in error since Margaret Court had already done so from 1968–1973. How soon the press forgets. Fyunck(click) (talk) 07:05, 28 July 2021 (UTC)\nYes, I have read information about Navrátilová as well.Kacir 08:17, 28 July 2021 (UTC)"

        "content": "Phil Mitchell is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Steve McFadden. He was introduced to the soap opera on 20 February 1990 and was followed by his brother Grant (Ross Kemp), sister Sam (Danniella Westbrook/Kim Medcalf) and mother Peggy (Jo Warne/Barbara Windsor). Phil was one of the major characters introduced by executive producer Michael Ferguson, who wanted to bring in some macho male leads. Phil and his brother Grant became popularly known as the Mitchell brothers in the British media, with Phil initially portrayed as the more level-headed of the two thugs. Storylines featuring the Mitchell family dominated the soap opera throughout the 1990s, with Phil serving as one of the show's central characters and protagonists since the 1990s. McFadden temporarily left the series in late 2003, then returned in April 2005 for a brief appearance before making a permanent return in October 2005, and has now overtaken Dot Cotton (June Brown) as the second-longest-serving character in EastEnders – surpassed only by original character Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). A teenage version of Phil, played by Daniel Delaney, appeared in a flashback episode broadcast on 5 September 2022, which focuses on the Mitchell family in the 1970s.\nPhil's most prominent storylines include his battles with alcoholism and addiction; suffering from cirrhosis of the liver; various criminal dealings; having an affair with Grant's wife Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) — a storyline popularly dubbed \"Sharongate\"; a failed marriage to Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth); a longstanding animosity with his tormented stepson Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt); sparking numerous feuds and rivalries; having relationship problems; seeking to avenge the death of Sharon's adoptive brother and later husband Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) by confronting his gangland killer, Johnny Allen (Billy Murray), in the \"Get Johnny Week\" storyline; becoming a prime suspect in the murder of his uncle Archie (Larry Lamb) (see \"Who Killed Archie?\"); developing an addiction to crack cocaine that sparks the events of The Queen Vic Fire Week; his ongoing struggle to bond with his children Ben (Max Bowden) and Louise (Tilly Keeper), a tempestuous relationship with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), which ends when Phil covers up her best friend Heather Trott's (Cheryl Fergison) murder after Ben kills her, discovering that his wife Sharon had a tryst with and supposedly fallen pregnant by his daughter Louise's fiancé Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters), the culmination of his feud with Keanu sparking the 35th anniversary episodes which sees Phil's stepson Dennis Rickman (Bleu Landau) die in a boat crash partly caused by Phil and Keanu's fight, and marrying Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace). As such Phil has also been a father figure to characters on the show, taking several under his wing including Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), his relative Jamie (Jack Ryder), Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick), and his stepsons Dennis and Tommy Moon (Sonny Kendall). \nOne of the most culturally significant storylines featuring the character aired in 2001 and was dubbed \"Who Shot Phil?\". The events saw Phil shot in a whodunit mystery, with the assailant eventually revealed to be his former girlfriend and Louise's mother Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). The \"Who Shot Phil?\" storyline captured viewer and media interest and the culprit-reveal episode was watched by 23 million viewers.\n\nCreation\nIn late 1989 EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Michael Ferguson, who took over from Mike Gibbon. Ferguson had previously been a producer on ITV's The Bill which seemed to be challenging EastEnders in providing a realistic vision of modern life in London. Due to his success on The Bill, Peter Cregeen, the Head of Series at the BBC, poached Ferguson to become executive producer of EastEnders.\nFor the roles of Phil and Grant Mitchell many actors were screen-tested together. This was done to assure the chosen actors – who would work together – had a strong rapport and physical resemblance. Producer Corinne Hollingworth commented: \"There were some good actors we had to turn down because we couldn't find the 'right' brother.\" Steve McFadden, an actor who had worked extensively in television, was cast as Phil. His shape, skills in stage fighting and a variety of sports including boxing, football and karate made him an ideal choice to play one of Walford's latest \"tough-men\". Ross Kemp got the role of Grant. Both actors worked well together and shared similar physical characteristics, such as short cropped hair and a \"round, open face\" – facial characteristics also shared by Danniella Westbrook, who was chosen to play their sister Samantha because of this.\n\nPersonality\nInitially, Phil was calmer than Grant but both brothers had a sense of physical danger, displaying stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Phil was originally depicted as the thinker and the more streetwise of the pair, often bailing his more spontaneous brother out of trouble, although later plotlines drove the character down a darker, more destructive route. Phil can be very violent, but unlike Grant, he occasionally showed restraint when dealing with various enemies encountered – exacting revenge over time, using mind games or getting others to do his dirty work, amongst other things.\nPhil has occasionally shown sadistic traits. His bullying of Ian Beale is often done as a means of deriving pleasure. Equally the ceaseless degradation of Lisa showed a particularly malicious side to the character. While Phil has shown compassion to the women in his life, he frequently finds he is unable to give them the emotional security needed to sustain the relationship. Several women have left him due to this and his inability to put their needs before the needs of his family.\n\nCharacter development and impact\nThe Mitchell brothers quickly became two of the soap's most popular characters and storylines involving them began to dominate the programme. Their arrival heralded a new era for the soap, which aptly coincided with the beginning of a new decade – EastEnders during the 1980s having been very much dominated by the hugely popular Watts family.\n\nSharongate\nOne of the most notable and popular early storylines involving Phil was a love triangle between him, his brother and his brother's wife Sharon (played by Letitia Dean). Despite the fact that Sharon was married to Grant, EastEnders writer Tony Jordan revealed in The Mitchells – The Full Story that the love-triangle storyline had been planned since Phil and Grant's introduction, after the writers decided Sharon was perfect for them both. This storyline was slow burning and spread over several years, providing a plethora of dramatic tension along the way. The episode in which Phil betrayed his brother with Sharon occurred in September 1992 in one of the soap's notorious three-handers. Things finally came to a head in 1994 with some of EastEnders most popular and renowned episodes, which were dubbed \"Sharongate\" – centred around Grant's discovery of the affair and his reaction. The repercussions of Phil's betrayal contributed to many subsequent storylines involving the Mitchell brothers during the 1990s. Sharongate has also proven a popular storyline with viewers and it was voted the sixth top soap opera moment of the decade in a poll of 17,000 people for What's on TV magazine.\n\nAlcoholism\nAmong the many issues Phil has been used to cover is alcoholism and the consequences the condition has upon the sufferer's life. The relationship between alcohol abuse and domestic violence was explored between Phil and his wife Kathy (played by Gillian Taylforth) culminating in the slow deterioration of their marriage, which gripped viewers throughout 1997. Of particular note is an episode where Phil attends Alcoholics Anonymous (February 1997), an \"alien and uncomfortable arena\" where he was forced to talk about his condition, expose his vulnerability and reveal the basis of his problem – the physical abuse he'd received from his father and his fear that he will do the same. Writer Jacquetta May, who once played Rachel Kominski in the show, evaluated the episode in an article about social realism, education and the moral messages within EastEnders storylines, commenting: \"The episode blames his destructiveness on the 'male' response to self-hate: violence. It says that unless problems are worked through (the female method), they will be repeated generation after generation\". This particular episode has also been used in a study by the Stirling Media Research Institute, where men were asked questions about the violence contained within a spectrum of broadcast television material. The study reported that much group discussion centred on the Alcoholics Anonymous group scene, which was, for the most part, seen as an accurate depiction of an AA group therapy session. In addition, Phil's portrayal of a suffering alcoholic was also seen as realistic and a \"typical portrayal of bottled-up masculinity\".\n\nThe Mitchell car crash\nPhil's disposition altered during the early 2000s when a darker more menacing side to his personality began to surface. This change was perhaps a consequence of Grant's departure, who up until this point had always been depicted as the more selfish, thuggish and nastier of the two. The storyline signifying the departure of Ross Kemp played heavily on the Mitchell brothers' fragile and damaged relationship. After discovering that Grant had vengefully slept with Kathy, Phil went ballistic with a handgun causing the hijacked Vauxhall Astra they were driving to career at high speed into the River Thames, in an episode that was watched by 19.5 million viewers. Shot in London's Docklands, the scenes required stunt doubles, divers and crash test dummies and it has been hailed as \"one of the soap's most dramatic storylines ever.\"\n\nWho Shot Phil?\nPhil's behaviour earned him a number of sworn enemies in Albert Square and by 2001 the character had become one of the soap's nastiest villains. In an interview with The Guardian McFadden commented on his alter ego's descent into villainy \"Phil's been had over by a lot of people, so now he feels like he can do it back. It's his history\". However, the character finally received his comeuppance in one of EastEnders most highly anticipated storylines, dubbed \"Who Shot Phil?\". Phil was gunned down outside his home in March 2001 in a \"Dallas-style\" whodunit mystery. Various key characters were in the frame for the deed and viewers were left guessing for weeks as to which of them was the real culprit. Several outcomes were allegedly filmed and it was reported that only a few TV executives knew the identity of the would-be assassin – even the actors were kept in the dark. A spokesman commented \"The cast are only getting their own scripts. They are not being told anyone else's storylines. Not even Phil knows who shot him. It's top secret.\" Script writers were reportedly given private security after a writer's laptop was stolen in what was believed to be an attempt to gain the identity of the assailant. The storyline captivated the public's imagination leading to thousands of bets being placed at the bookies across the UK – bookmaker William Hill said there was about 50,000 bets on who was responsible.\nAn estimated 22 million viewers watched EastEnders on 5 April 2001 to find out that Lisa Shaw – Phil's ex-girlfriend – was the culprit. The episode caused the third-largest power surge on record, and the Liverpool and Barcelona UEFA Cup semi-final was postponed for 10 minutes to accommodate a special 40-minute edition of the soap.\n\nTemporary departure (2003)\nIn February 2003, it was confirmed that Steve McFadden would be taking a year hiatus. McFadden said: \"I'm going to stick my mechanic's overalls in a locker while I take a look at a few other projects. EastEnders will always be No1 in my heart and I look forward to returning to Albert Square.\" Executive producer Louise Berridge went on to say that she was \"looking forward to Steve returning in 2004\". In July 2004, it was announced that McFadden had delayed his return. In February 2005, it was confirmed that McFadden would return. His return scenes aired in April 2005 for a brief stint before returning full-time in October.\n\nDrug addiction\nIn June 2010, it was reported that Phil would develop an addiction to crack cocaine after his troubled personal life leads to depression. The report followed the news that Lucy Benjamin was to return for a single episode, reprising her role as Lisa, the mother of Phil's daughter Louise (Brittany Papple). In the storyline, Phil gains custody of Louise after she is dropped off in Walford by an unseen person; however, Peggy eventually returns Louise to Lisa after Phil punches his mother in the face. A spokesperson for the show said \"Lisa Fowler was a major part of Phil's life – she knows him as well as anyone, so she won't be happy about him looking after his daughter. With their history, you know that this storyline is going to be an explosive episode in the Mitchells' history.\" Phil also loses his son Ben (Charlie Jones), who makes a temporary departure from the show in order for the part to be recast. Subsequently, Phil becomes addicted to crack cocaine. Producers worked closely with drug and alcohol charities, including Addaction and DrugScope. Viewers never see Phil take drugs to make sure the episodes are suitable for all audiences. Martin Barnes, chief executive of DrugScope, commented: \"If EastEnders sensitively reflect the impact that drug use has on Phil, it could help.\" The storyline also sees Phil become more violent. McFadden explained:\n\nAll he can see is Peggy's betrayed him. She knows how much he fought for custody, for contact and how important it was for him to see his children. He's really angry about it and feels the world is against him. [...] What he's really doing is self-harm which is a common response to anger. People do crazy, mad things like this when they're desperate. It's very ugly and disturbing. [...] He's hit his kids and his mum, so yes, [worse violence is] something he's capable of.\nMcFadden decided to lose weight for the storyline by going on a crash diet, saying that food would not be one of Phil's priorities.\n\nOther storylines\nThe character continues to be featured heavily in high-profile storylines which have included various feuds, police enquiries, armed robbery, kidnapping, numerous affairs and relationship problems and an ongoing plot concentrating on the character's struggles to bond with his children. 2005 saw the highly anticipated screen return of both of the Mitchell brothers – six years since they last appeared together. 13 million viewers tuned in to see their return giving the BBC a 52.9% British audience share, a massive coup for the show which had come under heavy criticism in the British media after it drew its lowest audience in more than five years (6.6 million viewers tuning in to one episode in September 2005).\n\nStorylines\n1990–2003\nPhil Mitchell first arrives in Walford in February 1990 to open an automobile repair shop, known as The Arches; he is joined by his younger brother Grant (Ross Kemp).\n\nTwo years later, Phil goes into partnership at The Queen Victoria public house with Grant and his wife Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) – up to the point where he moves in with them. Phil grows close to Sharon, who turns to him for comfort during Grant's violent outbursts. Sharon and Phil have sex but she stays with Grant, who is unaware of their betrayal. Sharon and Grant's reconciliation is brief, and amidst more rowing and physical violence, Grant is arrested and imprisoned. In his absence, Phil and Sharon continue their affair but when Grant is released, Sharon reconciles with him, leaving Phil heartbroken. On the rebound, Phil enters into a marriage of convenience with Nadia Borovac (Anna Barkan) - a Romanian refugee - enabling her to stay in Britain, with Nadia departing after the wedding.\nPhil begins a relationship with a divorced Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), but Nadia returns, needing Phil to prove he is her husband to prevent deportation. She moves in with him while she is investigated. Nadia seduces and sleeps with a drunken Phil. He regrets it, denying it to Kathy so Grant threatens to kill her to make her leave but Phil later bribes her into agreeing to a divorce. Kathy agrees to marry Phil in 1994, despite the pair having to overcome a incident where he torched a vehicle in a car lot owned by his future stepfather Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) to secure an insurance scam; the result accidentally killed a homeless boy trapped inside. Intent on winning him back, Sharon kisses Phil but he ends things there. During Phil and Kathy's engagement party, Grant plays an audio cassette recording of Sharon admitting to the affair. Kathy is incensed, and Grant beats Phil so badly that he has to go to hospital, due to a blood clot on his brain. Phil undergoes surgery, which stirs remorse in Grant. He pressures Phil into blaming Sharon for their affair and Grant forces her to leave Walford. Phil and Grant make peace but things between them are not the same.\nKathy and Phil eventually sort out their differences, up to the point where they get married and Kathy later gives birth to their son – Ben (Matthew Silver). As time goes on, however, Phil becomes depressed and turns to alcohol – which causes him to develop an addiction. This makes him bitter and neglectful towards Kathy and Ben, so Kathy takes Ben and moves out.\nRealizing what he has lost, Phil gives up alcohol and attends Alcoholics Anonymous. This progressively helps Phil, up to the point where it manages to reveal the basis of his problem – the physical abuse he received from his late father, Eric (George Russo) when he was a boy, and his fear that he may abuse Ben. He and Kathy reconcile when he attends counselling, but soon he cheats on Kathy by sleeping with fellow alcoholic Lorna Cartwright (Janet Dibley) – who starts stalking him. With his marriage in jeopardy, Phil takes Kathy to Paris and admits his dalliance with Lorna so Kathy throws her wedding ring into the river, saying their marriage was over for good. Phil begins sleeping rough, gambling, and blaming Kathy for his decline. This prompts her to leave Walford for South Africa, letting it be known that an offer of reconciliation from Phil would make her reconsider. Phil is undecided until Lorna stops him going after Kathy by locking herself in his bathroom and attempts suicide. He later follows Kathy to the airport but is stopped by Kathy's son, Ian (Adam Woodyatt), who persuades him that Kathy and Ben are better off without him. Phil agonies over the loss of his son.\nTo distract himself, Phil gets involved in a protection racket with Annie Palmer (Nadia Sawalha), who he is also having casual sex with, but grows tired of being bossed around by her and quits. He starts seeing Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin), but the relationship stalls when Kathy returns briefly in 1999 and sleeps with Grant. Before Kathy returns to South Africa, she asks Phil to go with her but he declines as Grant has planned an armed robbery and Phil refuses to let him do the job alone. Infuriated by Phil's loyalty to Grant, Kathy reveals their recent tryst, leading to Phil confronting Grant and Grant's confession that he slept with Kathy as revenge for Phil's affair with Sharon. While trying to escape, Phil pulls out a gun and shoots at the dashboard, causing Grant to crash into the River Thames. Phil is rescued, but Grant isn't found and is presumed dead. However, it is soon revealed that Grant is alive and he escapes to Brazil – though not before sending Phil and their mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) the deeds for his half of The Queen Vic. Though Phil is entrusted by his mother to protect Grant's share of The Queen Vic, he ends up selling it to his business partner Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for £5 to spite Peggy due to her favouritism towards Grant. By then, Phil and Dan have become close friends; with Phil being the only person to defend Dan when he is revealed to have cheated on his girlfriend Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) by having an affair with her daughter Bianca (Patsy Palmer), the wife of Frank's son Ricky (Sid Owen). By this stage, Phil's mother Peggy has married Frank.\n\nPhil and Dan's friendship soon ends after Dan tells the police about a motor scam Phil was involved in and Phil cons Dan into signing the pub over to Peggy. Phil is unsupportive when his girlfriend, Lisa, has a miscarriage and he starts domestically abusing her by getting her sacked from her job and insists she stays at home. This makes her dependent on him so he moves on to her best friend, Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). Lisa is paranoid that Phil is having an affair and accuses Mel of being his other woman, which she is not, at that point. However, Mel is upset by Lisa's accusation and Phil comforts her, leading to a one-night stand. Mel, however, realises it was a mistake and reconciles with his sworn enemy Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), making Phil jealous. The day before the wedding, Steve finds out that about Mel's one-night stand with Phil after overhearing the pair talk about it. Elsewhere, Lisa decides that a baby will improve their relationship so stops taking contraceptive pills. But Phil wants Lisa to leave him, not get pregnant, and so admits to Lisa that he and Mel slept together. Lisa is heartbroken and decides to keep quiet about her pregnancy, but not before telling her lover Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) about it; Mark, who has grown to resent Phil for his abusive treatment of Lisa, suggests they tell people that the baby is his and she agrees. Mel soon becomes outraged by Phil's volatile behaviour, such as his treatment of Lisa and Ian after refusing to help the latter when he undergoes financial bankruptcy.\nOn 1st March 2001, the day of Steve and Mel's wedding, Phil has created many enemies around him; Lisa, Steve, Mark, Ian, and Dan. Later on that night, Phil is shot and collapses in a pool of blood. Steve is the prime suspect and is arrested, but Phil – knowing Steve is innocent – confronts the real culprit, Lisa, weeks later after he is discharged from hospital. Realizing he drove her to it, Phil gradually forgives Lisa and instead decides to frame Dan upon learning that he has been extorting money from his godson Jamie (Jack Ryder) – whom Phil had taken under his wing to spare him from being further abused by his legal guardian and uncle, Billy (Perry Fenwick). His plan come to fruition when Phil contacts Dan's former crime boss, Ritchie Stringer (Gareth Hunt), and together to pair conspire to incriminate Dan for the shooting; with Ritchie giving Dan the same gun that Lisa used to shoot Phil. Unaware that he is being set up, Dan holds Phil at gunpoint – demanding money until he is arrested for attempted murder.\nDespite the pair still being fierce enemies, Steve later conspires with Phil to have Dan sent down in order to rid Mel from her tormentor for good, but Dan is ultimately acquitted despite their efforts. Dan later seeks revenge on Phil and Steve. After blackmailing Billy into telling him that Mel slept with Phil before she married Steve on the night of the shooting, Dan kidnaps Mel and alerts both Phil and Steve about this – threatening to kill her unless they pay him £200,000. After the two are forced to work together to provide £200,000 for Mel's release, Phil plans to take Dan down during the exchange. He momentarily subdues Dan and prepares to shoot him, but Mel – after learning how Phil and Steve framed Dan for the shooting – helps Dan by turning off the lights to distract Phil, which allows Dan to overpower him. Dan then escapes with the money, never to be seen in Walford again, while Phil recovers and returns to the square upon helping Steve rescue Mel.\nShortly before the events of Dan's trial and Mel's kidnapping, Sharon returns to the square; she reconciles with Phil and they run The Queen Vic together. Phil soon wants children with Sharon, but she reveals that she is infertile due to a botched abortion; Sharon later admits that the baby she aborted six years earlier was that of Grant. This soon puts a strain on their relationship and by Christmas they have separated, resulting in Sharon returning to the United States. They had been intent on adopting a baby until Peggy reacts to the suggestion with horror, and Sharon is not keen on Phil's suggestion of having a surrogate child.\nBefore Sharon leaves, she tells Phil that he is the father of Lisa's daughter Louise (Rachel Cox) – not Mark, as she had earlier claimed. Phil confronts Lisa, demanding contact. Unhappy at this, Steve and Mel ask Lisa and Louise to emigrate to California with them. She agrees but changes her mind and telephones Steve, asking him to return Louise. He refuses to, so Phil attempts to get Louise back, resulting in a car chase that ends when Steve crashes his car into a wall. Phil rescues Louise but the car explodes before he can help Steve, who dies in the inferno. Phil persuades Lisa to return to him and then makes it clear that it is Louise he and Peggy want, not Lisa. Phil and Peggy hire a nanny, Joanne Ryan (Tara Lynne O'Neill), without consulting her, telling her that Lisa is mentally unstable. Phil demands that Lisa change Louise's name to Mitchell legally and organises a christening. Lisa agrees until some of Phil's relatives, assuming she is the nanny, start talking about how unstable Louise's mother is. Furious at this, she and Louise flee to Portugal – with Jamie reluctantly assisting her after growing uncomfortable with Phil's violent tendencies. However, Phil soon takes his frustrations out of Jamie, who then dies after being struck by a car driven by Martin Fowler – leaving Phil devastated. After Jamie's funeral, Phil goes to Portugal and returns a month later with Louise. This causes some of Phil's neighbors to suspect that he has murdered Lisa.\nPhil soon falls for Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny), unaware that she is an undercover police officer investigating Lisa's disappearance. The police believe that Lisa is dead, and at one stage a body is found which the police fear may be that of Lisa. After Phil confesses that he manipulated Lisa to give him Louise and paid her to leave the square for good, Kate reveals her true identity. In response, Phil ends his romance with Kate and threatens to kill her – even when she admits to loving him with the promise of quitting her job. Kate disappears, but several months later, Phil finds her working as the secretary for the Walford's veteran reigning gangland kingpin – Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett). He soon begins to visit Dalton, most notably when Phil finds out that Dalton discovers Kate's identity. When Dalton plans to have her killed, sending his bouncer George Peters (Andy Beckwith) to rape and murder Kate in her house, Phil comes to Kate's rescue by knocking out Peters just as he attacks Kate. Though she insists on getting the police involved, Kate allows Phil to deal with Dalton on his own. This Phil does by frogmarching Peters back to Dalton's nightclub, the \"Imperial Room\", and urging Dalton himself to let Kate go free. Dalton agrees to spare Kate, but tells Phil that he now owes him a favor.\nIt is at this point where Sharon's adoptive brother, Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), arrives in Walford. Dennis is nearing 30 but Sharon had only discovered his existence in the spring of 2003 – he was the product of an affair between Sharon's adoptive father Den Watts (who had disappeared and supposedly died in 1989) and a younger woman called Paula Rickman, who dies just before Sharon finally manages to locate him.\nPhil and Dennis waste no time in becoming enemies, clashing when Dennis punches Phil in The Queen Vic. Later on, Phil learns that Dennis has previously been involved in Dalton's criminal organization – The Firm. This is further notified when Dalton summons Phil to carry out his favour with a task: killing Dennis. At first, Phil is willing to go along with it and goes to confront Dennis at Sharon's nightclub, \"Angie's Den\", where he holds him at gunpoint. Phil prepares to kill Dennis, but changes his mind when Dennis offers to kill Dalton himself – so that they can both be free of him; Phil reluctantly gives Dennis the gun to go after Dalton, and is later surprised to learn that Dennis actually killed Dalton as he promised. Following Dalton's death, his representative Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) confronts Phil over the circumstances of his and Dennis's alleged involvement; Phil denies involvement and Andy pardons him when he refuses to implicate Dennis for Dalton's murder.\nSoon afterwards, Phil rebuilds his relationship with Kate and the two get married. However, on their wedding day, Phil is unhappy when Lisa reappears – demanding access to Louise. When Phil refuses to do so, Lisa plans to shoot him again until she backs down. Phil later grows annoyed when Kate befriends Dennis, and ends up punching him upon learning that the two nearly had sex together. In the ensuing clash between them, Phil orders a group of his friends to beat Dennis up and later slaps Sharon when she confronts him over it. Towards the end of September 2003, Dennis and Sharon are reunited with their father Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) – who returns to the square after 14 years, when he had supposedly been shot dead on Dalton's orders.\nWhen Phil and Den cross paths with each other, they quickly become enemies, although Den manages to feign an admiration for Phil as part of his bid to bring about his downfall. Their feud culminates badly for Phil, when he reluctantly joins Den in an armed robbery – only to learn that Den had set him up on behalf of both Lisa and his family; Phil is subsequently arrested when the police arrive on the scene. When she discovers this, Lisa tells Kate that she is taking Louise. Unable to stop her legally, Kate agrees; however, Phil discovers this and his marriage with Kate ends after he refuses to forgive her for costing him Louise. Just before Christmas 2003, Phil escapes from prison and confronts Den; they fight until Den gives him £200,000 to survive 'on the run', and Phil punches Dennis in revenge for their earlier differences. Phil then flees Walford and is not seen for over a year afterwards.\n\n2005–present\nPhil returns 18 months later, needing more money. He attacks Ian, who calls the police and Phil is arrested. However, the case collapses after Grant returns to Walford and pays a witness to change his testimony and Phil is released. The brothers return to Walford when Peggy requests they help his sister Sam (Kim Medcalf), who is wrongfully remanded in custody for Den's murder; Den was murdered by his second wife and Sam's nemesis, Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman), after the duo and Sam's friend Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) initially worked together to get revenge on Den for his nefarious activities – including Sam's intent to avenge Phil's ordeal. Upon arriving at the square, Phil and Grant notice Peggy being mugged and end up rescuing her. Shortly afterwards, they learn that Peggy's mugging was organised by her enemy and Walford's newly installed crime kingpin: Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). This prompts Phil and Grant to confront Johnny, warning him to stay away from Peggy under the threat of further violence. The pair then confront Chrissie in the pub, where Phil stops Grant from attacking her and Dennis, before Sharon intervenes on their behalf. However, Sharon and Dennis soon learn the truth about Chrissie killing Den and they end up joining forces with the Mitchells to help Sam against Chrissie – with Phil and Dennis putting their differences aside over their previous rivalry.\nWhile Grant also make amends with Sharon by making peace with Dennis as well, Phil begins a feud with Johnny over his issue with Peggy and the fact that he and Chrissie are having a partnership over the pub's ownership. When Billy uses his job as Johnny's nightclub to discover CCTV footage of Chrissie confessing Den's murder to her boyfriend Jake Moon (Joel Beckett) and Johnny's henchman from an earlier night, Billy informs Phil – who goes to confront Johnny without Grant's consent. At first Phil attempts to negotiate with Johnny to no avail, but they end up fighting when Grant intervenes – punching Jake and helping Phil batter Johnny to steal the recording. As Jake flees to alert Chrissie of the situation, Johnny holds Phil and Grant at gunpoint to reclaim the recording – but relents in letting them escape when his daughter Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton) walks in on the incident. Before fleeing with the recording, Phil learns from Johnny that Ian is Chrissie's mystery buyer for the pub; he and Billy confront Ian, while Grant helps Sharon and Dennis look for Chrissie. Eventually, the police catch up to Chrissie just as she prepares to flee the country at the airport and Sharon punches her in revenge for her father's death; Chrissie is then arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment, while Sam is released from prison – only to end up fleeing the country when she finds herself implicated for perverting the course of justice for Den's murder. Despite the circumstances over Sam's ordeal, the Mitchells still celebrate Chrissie's imprisonment when Sharon announces that she forged a contract that Ian had signed – thereby meaning that Ian does not officially own the pub, and thus the Mitchells are the true owners of The Queen Vic once more. Around Christmas 2005, Phil escalates his feud with Johnny and ends up entrapping Dennis on his behalf; Dennis and Johnny embark on a conflict afterwards. When Phil discovers that Johnny threatened Sharon with Dennis' life, he attempts to intimidate Dennis in attacking Johnny in retribution; Dennis refuses, but relents when Phil tells him that Johnny killed Andy and throttled Sharon. Unfortunately, after Dennis batters Johnny at the stroke of the New Year, Johnny arranges for him to be stabbed and Dennis dies in Sharon's arms – leaving her devastated, while Phil becomes ridden with guilt for Dennis' death and vows revenge against Johnny. After comforting Sharon when she lashes out at Johnny in the wake of Dennis' funeral, Phil promises to avenge his death. Phil later convinces Grant to help him confront Johnny at his new home in rural Essex, but he escapes and the brothers pursue him. However, Phil's squabbling with Grant allows Johnny to capture them and Johnny orders Jake's brother Danny Moon (Jake Maskall) to kill the brothers. But before Danny can execute Grant, Jake arrives and shoots Danny – accidentally killing him, as Jake meant to merely stop his brother by shooting him in the arm or leg. While Jake buries Danny's body alone, Phil and Grant return to Johnny's home and find that Johnny has surrendered at Ruby's request; Johnny is later sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders of Andy and Dennis, though he later dies of a heart attack in October 2006. After resolving matters with Grant and securing Jake's safety from being exposed as a killer following the discovery of Danny's death, Phil resumes life with his family and Sharon.\nFollowing the supposed death of Kathy and her husband Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas) earlier on, Ben returns to England and moves in with Ian – much to Phil's surprise. Phil and Ben later spend time together and they slowly bond, eventually leading to Ben moving in with Phil. Phil starts dating Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson), but she mentally and physically abuses Ben – forcing him into persuading Phil to propose to her. Ben reveals the abuse during the wedding ceremony, and Stella flees to an abandoned warehouse with Phil in pursuit – where she kills herself by jumping from the roof. Later on, Phil claims to have killed Stella and is taken into custody – but is later released without charge. He then forms a relationship with local beautician Suzy Branning (Maggie O'Neill) in an attempt to move on from Stella, and the two end up getting engaged with each other after she falsely claims to be pregnant with his child. Phil does not believe his friend, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), when she tells him that Suzy is conning him; he stays with Suzy until he discovers she has been forging her pregnancy in a bid to con money from him.\n\nSoon afterwards, Phil recoups his alcoholism upon struggling to cope with his turbulent relationships with Stella and Suzy – up to the point where he nearly takes his frustrations out of Ben. During a family meal where Peggy is set to announce her engagement to her brother-in-law Archie (Larry Lamb), tensions build when Phil upsets Ben and nearly lashes out at him. This prompts Archie to confront Phil over his behaviour. In doing so, the two share a conversation about how they were respectively abused by their fathers – with Phil confining to Archie about to extent of how Eric treated him, before Archie explains that both he and Eric were mistreated by their father prior to his death; which Archie claims to be the \"best thing that happened to him\". Afterwards, Phil makes amends with Ben and the two support Archie when he and Peggy plan to get married. Their wedding initially appears successful, but it ends in disaster at the reception; Phil witnesses his cousin, Ronnie (Samantha Womack), discover that Archie – her father – had manipulated her into believing that her long-lost daughter Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace), whom she previously employed as her secretary, was dead. When Peggy learns the extent of Archie's deceit, she ends their marriage by ordering Phil to throw him out of the pub – shortly before the family learn that Danielle has died after being fatally struck by a car driven by Frank's daughter Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks).\nFollowing Danielle's funeral, Peggy asks Phil to kill Archie so they could get justice for Danielle and Ronnie. He obliges and has Archie kidnapped, but lets him go after threatening him to stay away from Walford. However, Archie later returns to the square and ignores Phil's constant demands that he leave Walford again. As Christmas approaches in December 2009, Phil and Peggy are horrified to learn that Archie has extorted the pub from them after he formed a relationship with Janine and the two conspired to have Ian collaborate with them – particularly when Phil gave Ian a loan and gets beaten up as a result of not being able to pay it back. This could have been a motive for both Phil and Peggy, along with their family, when Archie is later murdered on Christmas night. Afterwards, Phil is surprised when DCI Jill Marsden (Sophie Stanton) takes charge of the murder investigation; as Phil and Marsden became sworn enemies ever since she investigated his shooting – before going on to intercept Phil's criminal activities prior to him being set up for the robbery. During the investigation, Phil clashes with Janine as they both plan to retake various properties from the square. However, it is later revealed that Archie's killer was in fact his rape victim Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner); this was discovered just moments after her husband Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) fell to his death whilst on the run from the police, which Phil had witnessed in the midst of celebrating Ricky and Bianca's second wedding.\n\nAlthough troubled by lapses in alcoholism due to numerous family upsets, Phil begins to settle into a relationship with Shirley – particularly when she becomes a mother figure for Ben and Louise, who is staying with Phil while Lisa is away. Trouble stirs, however, when Phil ends up getting distant from both his children in 2010: Ben is sent to a juvenile offenders' unit for attacking his friend Jordan Johnson (Michael-Joel David Stuart), which sparks a clash between Jordan's father Lucas (Don Gilet) and Phil himself in the process, and Louise returns to her mother before the pair disappear under Lisa's guise that Phil can have contact at any time. Depressed, Phil embarks on a sexual relationship with drug addict Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks) and begins to use crack cocaine – developing an addiction. When Peggy finds out about this, she locks him inside her home so he cannot have access to drugs; however, Phil – suffering from withdrawal symptoms – escapes and confronts Peggy, setting the pub on fire as a result. Within minutes, the pub is ablaze and the roof collapses on Phil. He is rescued and Peggy leaves the next day, realising he is better off without her.\nShirley supports Phil through recovery. They steal a large amount of money from Ronnie's sister, Roxy (Rita Simons), to buy a house together. This is soon discovered by Ronnie and Roxy's mother, Glenda (Glynis Barber). In response, she makes a deal with Phil for her daughters' sake and the two later begin an affair. When Phil discovers Glenda is also having an affair with his enemy Ian, he threatens to tell Ian's wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett), unless he pays him £5,000. Phil's bullying of Ian almost costs him his life: when Ian finds Phil having a heart attack, he threatens to let him die but helps Phil for Ben's sake. Phil re-evaluates his life following his near-death experience and proposes to Shirley. Shirley initially accepts, but later changes her mind after discovering Phil's affair with Glenda; though she later forgives Phil for his infidelity, Shirley refuses to marry him.\nPhil reacts badly when he discovers Ben (now Joshua Pascoe) is gay, and makes it clear that he prefers Billy's foster son, Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick). Jay likes spending time with Phil and changes his surname to Mitchell, becoming Phil's surrogate son. Ben secretly enacts revenge on Phil for this rejection, terrorising him with letters, implying he has evidence to incriminate Phil for past misdemeanours. Among other deeds, Ben sends Denise Fox (Diane Parish) evidence that Phil supplied the cut-and-shut car responsible for her ex-husband, Kevin Wicks' (Phil Daniels), death in 2008. Denise's attempts to get Phil imprisoned fail; however, Marsden soon investigates the allegations and Ben tells her that Phil forced Stella to jump from the roof back in 2007. Phil is held on remand in prison on suspicion of Stella's murder and Ben delights in the distress he causes his father. Ian, however, is horrified by Ben's behaviour, and tells the police that Ben is lying; but Ben thinks Shirley's best friend, Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), is responsible. Fearful and angry, Ben retaliates by murdering Heather just as Phil returns to confront him. Blaming himself for Ben's actions, Phil makes the murder look like a burglary, spurns a grieving Shirley, allows his neighbors and family to become murder suspects, and bullies Ian into keeping quiet after Ben confesses to him.\nDuring a charity abseil on top of The Queen Vic, Shirley proposes to Phil and he accepts. At their engagement party, Sharon returns, begging for help, as she has left her fiancé John Hewland (Jesse Birdsall) at the altar and he has her son, Dennis Rickman (Harry Hickles). Phil helps her to rescue Dennis and they return with Phil to Walford. When Phil gets home, he finds that Shirley knows the truth about Heather's death. After a furious confrontation, he tries to convince her not to tell the police but Ben confesses to the police and is charged with Heather's murder. Jay is charged with perverting the course of justice and Phil orders him to change his statement so Ben will not go to prison, but Jay refuses and Phil disowns him but does manage to convince Roxy to lie in her statement. His solicitor, Ritchie Scott (Sian Webber), tells him that Ben could face a minimum of 10 years in prison. Shirley ends her relationship with Phil as she is unable to cope with his betrayal. Phil visits Ben in prison with Ian in the hope of persuading Ben to retract his confession but Ben refuses, insisting that he is doing the right thing as he needs to be punished. Ben refuses to have any contact with his family until his release.\nAfter Ben's departure, Phil bonds with Dennis. When Billy's great-granddaughter, Lexi Pearce, is taken into care, Lexi's mother Lola (Danielle Harold) tells Phil that Ben is Lexi's father and Phil is her grandfather. Lola agrees for Phil to have residence of Lexi and he suggests to Sharon that they pretend to be in a relationship to increase the chances of success, even though she is in a relationship with Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). They tell social workers that they are engaged but Shirley threatens to tell the truth, so Phil tells them the engagement is over. Phil is appointed Lexi's foster carer and ordered to arrange for Lola to visit Lexi three times a week but he immediately takes over, angering Lola by calling Lexi his baby, refusing to take presents that Lola buys for her and having her christened with the name Mitchell, instead of Pearce. Phil and Jack become rivals when Phil tells Jack that he will be with Sharon by the end of the year, and Phil even proposes to Sharon, though she accepts Jack's proposal of marriage instead. When Phil offers Sharon an increase of her salary, and a 19% stake in club, Jack is not pleased and punches Phil, who falls into the vehicle pit in the garage. Jack thinks he has killed Phil, but Phil later arrives at the pub and announces Jack's guilt. Jack is arrested but Phil does not press charges after Sharon convinces him for her and Lexi's sake. At the court hearing to determine Lexi's future, Phil exposes Lola's lateness and temper during her scheduled meetings with Lexi, sabotaging her chances of winning Lexi back. He later tells Billy that Lola will never get Lexi back, which Lola overhears. She snatches Lexi from his house. Lola evades Phil, Billy and Sharon, until eventually they find her. Phil tells Social Services it is his fault for being too relaxed with Lola, but then allows Lola to look after Lexi while he goes out. When Lexi is unwell, Phil praises Lola's actions, and decides to tell Social Services that Lola may be ready to have Lexi back.\nPhil and Sharon reunite after her relationship with Jack ends. However, it ends when Sharon's painkiller addiction puts Lexi in danger. Lola regains full custody of Lexi, leaving Phil to feel lonely. When Shirley's benefits are cut and she is forced to move out of the B&B, Phil secretly pays her rent. Shirley finds out and believes he is doing it so she will stay quiet about his involvement in Heather's death. Shirley demands money from Phil, which he does not have, forcing him to accept a deal from Derek's associate Carl White (Daniel Coonan) – who had recently arrived in the square. They soon clash, however, when it becomes clear that Carl plans to usurp Phil as the square's reigning hardman. After luring Phil into his car, Carl seemingly drives them to a meet-up with his associates. However, he then deliberately crashes the car after releasing Phil's seatbelt – thus causing Phil to be thrown through the windscreen. He is airlifted to hospital and requires an operation. While he is recovering, he puts Ronnie in charge of his businesses. Carl tries to intimidate her and use the garage for illegal purposes. Shirley confronts Carl about his actions, and she mysteriously disappears after this, though her friends believe she has gone to Greece as she had planned. Once recovered, Phil learns that Carl is framing their business partner Max Branning (Jake Wood) for causing the car crash – as well as using Ian as a false witness. Phil kidnaps Ian on the day of Max's trial so he cannot testify, and then kidnaps Carl once Max is acquitted. Phil prepares to kill Carl, but Carl implies that he caused harm to Shirley. He takes Phil to a block of run-down flats where Shirley is staying with her sister Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White). It quickly turns out Carl threatened Shirley to stay away from Walford or he would harm Phil's family. Carl leaves, and Phil pleads with Shirley to return to Walford. She agrees and they return together, after which Phil confronts Carl once Shirley returns to her home. Carl is unfazed by Phil's threats for retribution and gloats that he has contacts inside prison who can harm Ben if Phil does anything to him.\nAt the start of 2014, Phil learns that Carl has entrapped Ronnie into having a relationship with him – though she quickly ends it upon discovering his actions against the Mitchells. Phil later kidnaps Carl in the garage and plans to kill him, though Ronnie stops him at the last minute. However, as they reluctantly agree to force him out of Walford, Ronnie ends up killing Carl after he attempts to rape her whilst Phil is out of the garage.  After discovering this, Phil helps Ronnie cover up the murder – only for Sharon to investigate the pair upon learning of Carl's death. When she eventually confronts Phil about this, he confines to Sharon about how Ronnie killed Carl to protect their family against his threats. Sharon grows to accept his theory, but then demands to know if he is hiding anymore secrets from her – up to the point when she asks him what could be worse than covering up a murder. This prompts Phil to finally reveal the true circumstances of how Dennis died on New Year's Eve 2005, explaining how he is the reason Dennis attacked Johnny, prior to the latter having him killed. In response, Sharon runs away from Phil and becomes so distraught that she refuses to rebuild their relationship – though she eventually reconsiders after Phil apologizes to her about Dennis, and she forgives him soon afterwards.\nWhen Phil learns that Jake and Danny's cousin Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) has upset Roxy no sooner after she started working for him and the pair later got married, he retaliates by selling the pub to get one over Alfie. However, Phil is surprised when the pub's new owner turns out to be Shirley's brother Mick Carter (Danny Dyer). He then learns from Ben that Lola has ended their relationship and has begun dating Ian's son Peter Beale (Ben Hardy). When Phil confronts her about this, she tells Phil that he cannot see Lexi if he objects. This prompts Phil to confront Ian once more, forcing him to object to the relationship instead. Phil repairs his fractured relationship with Sharon and they have sex. Sharon resumes her relationship with Phil and moves in with him. Together, they buy 10 Turpin Road and convert it into a new bar, which Sharon names \"The Albert\". When Ian's daughter Lucy dies, Phil begins supporting his former enemy and helps him get back on his feet. Witnessing Ian's grief prompts Phil to try to get back in touch with Ben, but he is stunned when Ritchie tells him that Ben has already been released from prison. Phil starts to track down Ben, but is convinced by Jay and Sharon that Ben will return when he is ready. Phil is stunned when he realises that Mick is in fact Shirley's son, who she had at fourteen, subsequently raised by Shirley's parents as their son, without Mick ever discovering the truth. Phil then agrees to be her confidant for the secret in exchange for money, which Shirley steals from her younger son Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) at his salon; he later discovers this and confronts his mother about her involvement with Phil, who later warns Dean off when they cross paths.\nPhil soon gets into a disagreement with Sharon when she continually puts her work at The Albert before their relationship, only beginning to become more involved with the bar when she is unimpressed at his lack of interest in her work. Closing up one night after an event, two men break in and vandalize the bar, and when Sharon attempts to defend herself alone, she is severely beaten and left for dead. She is later hospitalized with a ruptured spleen, leaving Phil distraught – though he later admits to Shirley that he arranged for the men to scare Sharon at the bar, but believed the bodyguards that he hired for her would have protected her and did not realise that she would be hurt. When Shirley confesses she still loves Phil, he spurns her advances and instead proposes marriage to Sharon after she regains consciousness. Unaware of Phil's role in her attack, Sharon accepts. However, she later overhears his secret and begins plotting against him with the help from their family solicitor Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett). Despite this, she later changes her mind and asks Marcus to return all Phil's money to his accounts – unaware that Phil has seen them. After meeting with his accountant, Phil is angry and tells Shirley what he has discovered only for their conversation to turn to passion. Phil later changes his mind; he realises that since Sharon is returning the money, it should not matter to him as he still wants to go through with the wedding. They later marry, but are oblivious to Shirley's bitterness – up to the point where she attempts to persuade him to be with her, rather than Sharon, only hours before the wedding. After the reception, Shirley enters their house and confronts them; Sharon is left devastated when she realises Phil has been cheating behind her back even after he asked her to marry him. However, she decides that she still loves Phil and wants to be with him. After Phil insults Shirley and makes hurtful remarks about the fling they had together, an enraged Shirley attempts to go for him, but Sharon stops her, and after a brief struggle, Phil is accidentally shot. He is then rushed to hospital, Shirley fleeing with the help of her aunt, Babe Smith (Annette Badland). When Ronnie discovers her gun was used after Shirley stole it, Ronnie asks Jay and Ben to dispose of it.\n\nWhen Phil finds out that Ronnie has stolen money from him to bribe their enemy Nick Cotton (John Altman) to leave before her wedding, they argue. After Nick takes the money but refuses to leave, Ronnie asks Phil to get rid of Nick. Nick overhears this, and cuts the brakes of the wedding car. Later, while Phil confronts Nick in his house, Ronnie goes into labour and on the way to the hospital, the wedding car crashes. Whilst still at the hospital, Phil is arrested for attempted murder and – realising that Nick has framed him – asks Sharon to help him prove his innocence. When Phil learns that Max has taken over The Arches, he promises revenge and blames Sharon for the loss of the business. He is released on bail and vanishes, to Sharon's concern; he returns a week later, with Peggy, to get a passport. He comes close to telling Ian something, but is interrupted by Ben, who is shocked to see he is back. When Sharon confronts him, she tells him that she will leave him if he indulges in anymore dodgy activity. Phil vanishes again, and is next seen meeting with a long-thought dead Kathy in central London. She wants to return to Walford, but Phil tells her to stay away – for Ian and Ben's sakes.\nBen is arrested on suspicion of murdering Ian's daughter Lucy (Hetti Bywater). Phil suspects he did and practically disowns him, handing in critical evidence to the police. However, Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) tells Phil that she thinks her father, Max, killed Lucy, so Phil punches Max and hopes Ben will be released. Phil finds out that Sharon has been helping Jane cover up the real killer Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington), Lucy's half-brother, Phil tells Jane and Sharon that he will bribe the foreman of the jury to make sure Max is not guilty. The jury find Max guilty and it emerges that Phil paid the foreman for this verdict. Sharon discovers this and kicks him out of their home. He then discovers that Ben is in a sexual relationship with Paul Coker (Jonny Labey) and is kidnapped by Kathy's husband, Gavin. Weeks later, the police find Phil's blood in the house that belonged to Gavin's sister – Margaret Midhurst (Jan Harvey). A week later, Phil returns home, battered and bruised. He collapses and is taken to hospital, where they discover he has several broken bones from two days before. He then asks Ben for alcohol, revealing he has been drinking during his kidnapping.\nIt soon transpires one of Phil's neighbours, Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood), is out for revenge against his family – because he believes that Phil's father Eric had murdered his own father, Henry, many years earlier. Their conflict leads to Phil abducting Vincent's daughter Pearl, with the two threatening to shoot each other – up to the point where Vincent attempts to strangle Phil to death, before later sorting out their differences when his friend Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) gets accidentally killed. By then, Phil's drinking worsens and he drives with Ian and Dennis in the car whilst intoxicated. Distracted, Phil crashes the car, and Dennis is badly injured. In exchange for Sharon not telling the police about Bobby killing Lucy, Phil agrees with Ian that Ian will take the blame for causing the crash. While Dennis is being attended to, a doctor tells Phil that his scans showed he has cirrhosis of the liver, a disease garnered from his alcoholism. The doctor warns Phil that without treatment, he could die, but Phil remains in denial about this. He later researches cirrhosis online at home and when he finds out that Dennis is recovering, decides to give up drinking and rushes to the hospital to tell Sharon that he will always stand by her.\nEventually, Phil feels guilty about the crash and drinks alcohol again. He confesses the truth to Shirley, who encourages him to tell Sharon. He does so, and Sharon punches him and insists she will divorce him. Phil begs her to stay, admitting he is dying from cirrhosis. Sharon does not believe him, but tells him to die quickly. No longer wanted by his family, Phil leaves and sleeps in a car. Wanting Louise's address, he discovers that Peggy is back in London, so visits her. He gets the name of Louise's school before Peggy tells him that her cancer has returned and she is dying. Phil finds Louise (now played by Tilly Keeper) at her school and he gives her money to support her future. He then collapses. Later, Louise goes to Walford to tell the family that Phil is in hospital with a damaged liver. Sharon, Kathy and Shirley go to the hospital to find out that Phil discharged himself. They find Phil drunk at the pub, where he insults his family and hits Kathy. Days later, he coughs up blood and is taken to hospital. The doctor tells his family that he needs an urgent liver transplant and that if Phil continues to drink, he will be dead within 12 months. Phil and Ronnie learn that Phil must remain sober for at least six months before he can undergo the liver transplant. Ronnie vows to help Phil regain his sobriety and allows him to move in with her and Honey once he is discharged from hospital, but the drinking continues. Phil finally gives up after Sharon colludes with Ritchie to take the family businesses from Phil. After a bumping into a 'pregnant' Abi, she lies to Ben that she lost the baby she never had. A furious Ben tries to suffocate Phil but is stopped by Sharon. Phil orders Sharon and Ben out, before storming off. He then drunkenly trashes the Arches before commandeering a digger and demolishes the car lot. Phil is stunned when a badly injured Louise is found in the wreckage, and with her pleas he decides to finally give up the booze. Phil is later reunited with a dying Peggy. Grant also makes a brief reappearance, warning Phil to expect a war over money owed to Grant. The brothers try to dissuade Peggy from committing suicide but are unaware of pills secretly hidden in her makeup bag. Phil is devastated by her death, unable to make a eulogy for her funeral, especially when he reads the loving letter she left him. He finds out that Peggy betrayed his father to the police to protect Phil and visits her grave. Some time after, Phil tries to give Ian advice after Bobby violently assaults Jane, putting her in hospital.\nPhil is told by Ian that Ben has died after a homophobic attack following a night out, however this turns out to be Paul, Ben's boyfriend. Ben struggles to grieve for Paul's death and asks Phil for a gun to take revenge, but he refuses and Ben disappears. When Grant returns to Walford again, he accuses Phil of killing Peggy and still orders him to return all of the money Phil owes to him. After going through Sharon's bag, Phil learns that Grant has a son, Mark Fowler (Ned Porteous), with Sharon's best friend Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) as the mother following a one-night stand between them from 21 years previously. After agreeing to drop the truth, Phil denies speaking to Mark. Unbeknownst to Phil, Denise discovers she is five months pregnant by him as a result of a one-night stand they had. Ben and Jay are kidnapped by Paul's killers and he attempts to go after them; however, when he collapses, Grant offers to help him get Ben and Jay back. In gratitude for Grant rescuing Ben, Phil tells Grant that Mark is his son. Grant persuades Phil to attend Paul's funeral for Ben's sake, which he does. Phil lends Grant money to support him financially and Grant tells him to fight his liver condition. Later, Ben tells Phil that he will donate part of his liver. Phil advises against it but Ben is adamant, however, Ben's psychiatric test results mean that it is unlikely he will be able to. Phil is hospitalised again with an infection and Sharon discovers that Phil has changed his will to leave everything to Louise so she forces him to have the will amended to include her. When Jay returns, Sharon allows him back into the Mitchell household, and when Phil is discharged and returns home, he eventually allows Jay to live there. When Phil has been sober for six months, he refuses to have the transplant, devastating his family, though Sharon supports his decision. However, after one of Dennis's friends at school is stabbed and dies, Dennis is visibly upset, and therefore Phil decides to go on the transplant list after realising he does not want to put his family through the upset of his death. Phil decides he wants to spend Christmas alone and Sharon reluctantly agrees. Phil is taken to hospital when a liver is found and changes his mind about being alone at Christmas, and he does not change his mind after tests show that the liver is not suitable. Jay has a visit from his police public protection officer, who says Jay will have to move out as Louise is underage. Phil refuses to make Jay leave, despite being told that Louise could be taken into care. On Christmas Day 2016, a matching liver is found and Phil at last has the operation.\nMax returns to Walford and Sharon decides not to tell Phil, but when Max discovers that Phil bribed the foreman in his trial, Max visits Phil in hospital, revealing that he knows the truth. Phil hands Max his pillow, insisting that he kills him, but Max shakes his hand and says that he forgives him. Phil is unable to give Ronnie away on her wedding day to Jack, so she and Roxy visit him in hospital. The next day, Sharon tells Phil that Ronnie and Roxy have died in the hotel swimming pool – which devastates Phil. Phil is discharged from hospital and Sharon eventually discovers that Phil is the father of Denise's baby after overhearing a discussion between Shirley and Denise. Sharon decides not to tell Phil the truth, but later changes her mind when she learns that Denise is planning to give her son up for adoption. When Phil expresses his wish to adopt Dennis, Sharon tells him the truth about his son. At the hospital, Phil demands to see his son, but Sharon gets him and Denise to talk calmly. Sharon agrees to help Phil fight for his son. After emotionally holding him, Phil leaves without him. Phil refuses to speak at Ronnie and Roxy's funeral, but changes his mind after Michelle (now played by Jenna Russell) speaks to him. Phil meets Aaron, the son of his friend Tony, who was meant to have the liver the Phil received, and gives him money out of guilt for having survived when Tony died; however, Aaron's mother, Antoinette, returns it and tells him not to contact them again. Phil decides that he wants to take time away from Walford to recover from his transplant and he and Sharon decide to go to Italy. Sharon returns two months later without Phil and she informs Michelle that they have bought a holiday apartment in Italy and that he regularly attends Alcoholics Anonymous.\nFive months later, when Louise suffers burns from being pushed into lit candles by bullies Alexandra D'Costa (Sydney Craven) and Madison Drake (Seraphina Beh) at her prom party, Ben contacts his father. Phil turns up at the hospital, where he is surprised and unimpressed to find Lisa there already. Sharon and Louise ask Phil to give Lisa a chance. Lisa apologizes to Phil for the past mistakes, regarding Louise and says that they both need to be there for her. Phil appears to oblige at first, but then proceeds to physically throw Lisa out of the hospital – ordering her to stay away from their daughter. Lisa stays with Louise at the hospital and Lisa stands up to Phil, telling him she is not going and Phil allows Lisa to visit Louise. Phil warns Lisa not to mess up. The doctor gives Lisa consent to take Louise outside and Lisa tells Louise she has been discharged. Lisa plans to take Louise, going to Liverpool Street station. Phil and Sharon find Louise's room empty and the doctor reassures them of Lisa and Louise's whereabouts, although they find Louise's belongings gone. Phil is angry as the doctor explains how Louise is at a crucial stage in her recovery and the police tell Phil and Sharon what they are doing. Phil and Sharon are told Lisa switched cabs and find Lisa's flat, which is empty. Louise wakes up and Lisa lies to her that she and Phil agreed for her to be away from the square, while Phil and Sharon question Lisa's capabilities. The police, Phil and Sharon discuss Lisa being traced through her cash withdrawals in Castle Point and that she has a mental health team. Louise is in agony without her medication and Lisa prevents Louise from using the phone by cutting the cord. Louise realises Lisa is not taking her medication. Louise's phone dies as she tries to phone the police and Lisa prevents Louise from leaving, but when Lisa allows her to go, Louise chooses to stay with and comfort Lisa when she is distressed. Bex gives Phil and Sharon information on a hotel where Lisa and Louise are and compared to Sharon, Phil shows a lack of regard to Lisa's mental health. Phil finds Louise but she tells him to leave. Phil gains entry to their room and Lisa hits Phil over the head with a phone. Phil shouts at a struggling Lisa as Louise deteriorates and Lisa and Louise go to hospital together. Louise asks Phil if she could have inherited Lisa's condition and Phil admits his part in causing Lisa's illness. Louise confides in Phil about her guilt of leaving Lisa when she was ill and she rubbishes Phil's belief he is a bad father.\nPhil tells Sharon he wants to adopt Dennis. He then receives an offer on the car lot land and confides in Kathy about the guilt he still has over the car lot fire. He tells Sharon that he would provide for Raymond and Aaron and pay off debts if he accepted. Ben signs the paperwork for the garage when Phil decides to hand it over to him and Sharon is left stunned when he decides to give Jay the car lot land, as it is worth more than the garage. Kathy insists to Phil that he justifies his reasons to Ben about giving Jay the car lot land. Ben finds a solicitor's letter of Phil's that mentions Raymond and after confronting Phil, Phil tells Ben that Raymond is his half-brother. Ben is angry with Phil for making him feel second best to his and Sharon's other children. Jay attempts to confront Phil about why he is receiving the car lot and Phil admits he killed his biological father, Jase Dyer, who died in the car lot fire when Phil torched it 23 years previously in an insurance scam. Phil then reveals this to be a lie in a mysterious phone call. Billy confronts Phil over his actions and ends up punching him. Later, Phil is knocked unconscious when the exposed gas line explodes during the Walford in Bloom event – but he is unharmed.\nMonths later, Ian summons Phil with a request; Kathy's rapist James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) has returned to Walford. Phil visits Willmott-Brown at his house and warns him to stay away from Kathy. There, Phil discovers Ben's current boyfriend Luke Browning (Adam Astill) is Willmott-Brown's son when he finds a photo of them. Phil tells Kathy of Luke's identity and he warns Luke to stay away from Ben, which backfires as Luke tells Ben about Phil's threat. Ben is left furious at Phil and Kathy is eventually forced to tell Ben that Willmott-Brown has raped her. Phil's former prison cellmate, Aidan Maguire (Patrick Bergin), arrives in Walford and tells Phil that he is planning a robbery and promises to give Phil half of the money if he participates. Phil accepts, and helps Aidan recruit a crew for the heist; Mick and Vincent join the pair along with their new friend, Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters). When Luke beats up Ben as Willmott-Brown has orchestrated, Phil asks Aidan to help scare Luke off. The robbery goes wrong when Mick is shot, and the police arrive. Phil and Aidan hide the stolen money in a coffin in Billy's funeral parlour. However, the money later goes missing. Phil and Aidan try to find the money, unaware that Sharon stole it but was forced to return it to its rightful owner, Aidan's former wife, Ciara Maguire (Denise McCormack). Aidan blames Mick for taking the money but Phil discovers it was Sharon. Aidan threatens Mick's livelihood and his family, and eventually, Phil is convinced to help Mick. After discovering Aidan has been tormenting Mick and his family, Phil punches Aidan and shows him evidence that he killed Luke – which forces Aidan to leave Walford for good.\nIn 2019, Phil is led to believe by Sharon that she is pregnant with his child. This turns out to be false as Sharon is actually pregnant with Keanu's child, with whom she had an affair with in 2018, which was briefly resumed in 2019, which resulted in Sharon's pregnancy. Keanu is a close associate of Phil and his business, Keanu is also engaged to Louise, who is also pregnant with Keanu's baby. Keanu and Sharon maintained the lie that Sharon's baby is in fact Phil's and not Keanu's. Later in 2019, Phil is told by Lisa that he is not the father of Sharon's baby. Phil, unsure of whom to believe, begins investigating alongside Ben into who is the real father of Sharon's baby. Phil comes to believe that the father is in fact Jack. Because of this, Phil captures and tortures Jack, planning to kill him, but is stopped by Ben and Keanu after realising that Jack is not the father. Phil eventually works out that Keanu is the father of Sharon's baby after he and Sharon tell identical stories regarding a hotel that they could only know if they were together. Phil then swears to have revenge, planning to kill Keanu and confront Sharon. Phil confronts Sharon, letting her know he knows that her baby isn't his and that Keanu is the real father. Ben, who has been blackmailing Martin Fowler, agrees to destroy evidence for him if he kills Keanu for the Mitchells, Martin agrees and Louise helps set Keanu up. Martin, then takes Keanu to a warehouse, where he had to kill him and record himself doing it as proof for the Mitchells. However, Martin cannot go through with it so he and Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) help Keanu fake his death and escape abroad with a new identity.\nAfter the disappearance of Keanu, due to him faking his death, the Mitchells and Taylors think that Keanu is dead. The police begin investigating Keanu's disappearance and Phil's connection to it. Phil denies any involvement in Keanu's disappearance but later discoverers that Sharon has given the police the video that Martin filmed of Keanu's supposed death. Because of this, Phil flees the country, moving to Portugal with Louise and Lisa.\nIn February 2020, Keanu returns to the square and captures Ben's boyfriend, Callum Highway (Tony Clay), demanding £100,000 for his freedom.

On finding out Keanu is still alive, Phil goes to kill him himself. The Queen Vic have won a boat party, which the residents of Walford attend. While on board, Phil confronts Keanu with a gun, demanding to know where Callum is and also to confront him about his affair with Sharon. After talking, it appears Keanu has talked Phil out of killing him but when Shirley cannot find Callum in the address Keanu has given, Phil snaps and prepares to kill Keanu. This results in a fight on the deck of the boat, in which the captain is knocked out. The fight spills into the cabin and the wheel of the boat is knocked, steering it into a port in the River Thames causing the boat to crash and sink. Dennis is killed in the boat crash. Ben also loses his hearing after hitting his head in the crash. Keanu escapes after surviving the accident and is last seen leaving his mother Karen and departing the tube station.\nLater in the year, Phil attempts to buy back The Queen Vic, wanting to move his family into The Queen Vic after his split with Sharon. However, after seemingly having a deal sorted with Mick, Phil is beaten to the sale by Sharon and Ian. Later in 2020, after Sharon and Phil find out that Ian locked Dennis in a room during the boat crash, they plan their revenge on him. This results in Ian being attacked by an unknown assailant. It is revealed that Phil attacked Ian at Sharon's request, although Ian survived the attack. After this, Sharon attempts to poison Ian, but cannot go through with it. Ian later departs Walford.\nIn 2021, Phil has been helping Sharon, Sharon wants to rekindle their relationship but Phil is unsure. Phil and Sharon are meant to go on a date, however, Phil backs out instead heading to The Arches where he later tells Sharon he isn't ready yet. After this, it is revealed Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) is in the Arches, waiting for Phil as they sleep together. Following on from this, Phil tells Sharon they are over forever and begins a secret relationship with Kat.\nPhil prepares for his son Ben's marriage to Callum. However, Callum reveals to Ben that he had been collecting evidence on Phil for the police to send Phil down, as a way to keep Ben out of prison for a heist carried out by the Mitchell's in 2020. Phil later finds this out and wants revenge on Callum. After being unsure Ben and Callum eventually marry without Phil present, however, Phil later confronts Callum on the square after the wedding about his involvement with the police's plan to take down Phil. After arguing for a while, Kat tries to talk Phil round, until suddenly Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) attempts to run over Ben as she falsely believes he is responsible for the death of her fiancé Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami). Whitney instead accidentally runs over Kat and drives off, after this Phil stays in hospital with Kat until she recovers. When she does, she and Phil make their relationship public, however Phil is now not talking to Ben and Callum.

Keeble offers Phil a deal to be released from prison if he becomes a police informant. Phil initially rejects the deal, but eventually agrees to it, faking his death in the prison and being released.

Phil and Keanu are able to track down where Keeble is keeping the hostages at gunpoint, in a struggle Kat shoots Keeble with Keeble's gun. Phil then reasons with Keeble, stating he will get her to hospital to save her life if she agrees to drop the vendetta against the Mitchell's, Keeble eventually agrees to this deal and retires from the police force and Phil is a free man.\n\nReception\nPopularity\nThe character of Phil is arguably one of the soap's most popular, particularly with female viewers, making him one of the soap's unlikeliest sex symbols. He has featured in some of the show's most memorable and highly viewed storylines and he is the second longest running male character to appear in the soap, surpassed only by Ian Beale. Phil along with Grant was voted as the second most popular King of Soaps in a Channel 4 poll in 2002.\nDuring a period of heavy media criticism aimed at EastEnders throughout 2004 and 2005, the character—who was on a hiatus from the show—was reintroduced twice in what was branded by the press as a bid to \"boost flagging Enders.\" His first return in April 2005 was generally well-received, with media comments such as \"the excellent, bug-eyed Steve McFadden proves nobody does psychotic thug better than him\" and \"McFadden's blistering performance on Tuesday defies that old cliché of a soap being bigger than its stars\". Of the Mitchell brothers' highly publicised return in October 2005, a reporter from the Daily Mirror commented \"Soapville must confess that we did get goosebumps and feel properly excited when we first saw the Mitchell Brothers back on the Square...After all, you associate them with the golden days of Enders\".\nIn addition the character has been praised for being good value, realistic, consistent within his character and convincing.\nIn 2009, Phil Mitchell came second in a poll by British men's magazine Loaded for 'Top Soap Bloke'. In 2011 McFadden was nominated for 'Best Actor' at the British Soap Awards 2011 for playing Phil. as well as be nominated at the Inside Soap Awards for 'Best Actor' in 2011. On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, McFadden was nominated for \"Best Male Soap Actor\" and came fourth with 10.7% of the vote.\nIn 2016, McFadden was honoured at The British Soap Awards when he was awarded \"Outstanding Achievement' for his portrayal of Phil.[1]\nPhil is a consistent and central character in the satirical McFadden's Cold War collages by Cold War Steve.\n\nCriticism\nAlthough popular with many, the character has also garnered much criticism over the years. In November 2005 the character was blamed for turning children into playground bullies by Dr. Sally Henry, who claimed that impressionable children look to male soap characters as role models and subsequently copy their violent behaviour. Indeed, the character's violent behaviour evoked concern from viewers in October 2002. A scene in which Phil beat his godson Jamie was criticised for being too realistic by TV watchdogs. The Broadcasting Standards Commission upheld 31 complaints from viewers, saying that the scenes were too strong for a programme shown before the 9 pm watershed.\nA certain level of criticism was aimed at the character due to the stark personality change he underwent circa 2000. One reporter commented \"Formerly the milder-mannered sibling, Phil has gone from Abel to Cain without an intervening period of plausibility. And it doesn't suit him\". His violent tendencies have also been spoofed by the television series 2DTV. There were mixed reviews for the highly publicised storyline (dubbed Get Johnny Week) involving the Mitchell brothers reunion in 2006. It was criticised as \"patchy\" and \"awkwardly written...unveiling a common weakness in the EastEnders camp, that character continuity can often fall by the wayside when you are dealing with larger characters\". Additionally, the show was criticised for turning the brothers into a comical farce by incorporating uncharacteristic humour into their dialect, which was described as \"cringeworthy\".\nIn August 2010, scenes showing Phil and Rainie taking crack cocaine prompted over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying \"EastEnders in no way – and at no point – glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. We feel that Phil's decline will highlight the destructive nature of drugs, and rather than encourage drug use, will act as a deterrent.\"\nAngie Quinn from MyLondon wrote in 2021 that Phil \"can normally be seen wandering around the streets with an expression similar to a bulldog chewing a wasp.\".\n\nSee also\nList of EastEnders characters (1990)\nList of soap opera villains\nList of EastEnders: E20 characters\n\"Who Shot Phil?\"\n\"Sharongate\"\n\"Who Killed Archie?\"\n\"Queen Vic Fire Week\"\n\"Who Killed Lucy Beale?\"\n\"Get Johnny Week\"\n\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nExternal links\nPhil Mitchell at BBC Online"

A consultant, Saumya, despite her misgivings about them, tutors them in the answers to be given in the admission interview, but their limited knowledge of English means Pia's application is rejected.\nRaj and Meeta learn from an employee that his daughter has been admitted through the RTE quota, a scheme that helps children from poor families to be admitted to prestigious schools. After a scam reveals that rich parents are gaming the quota to admit their children, they move to Bharat Nagar, a slum area, for a month and pretend to be poor. They strike a friendship with Shyam Prakash and Tulsi Prakash, who are hopeful that their son Mohan gets to study at Delhi Grammar School through the RTE quota. Shyam and Tulsi teach them to live like truly poor people, and Raj joins Shyam at work. However, while Pia eventually gets admission, Mohan's application is rejected.\nRaj, Meeta & Pia return to Vasant Vihar. Raj and Meeta make a donation to the Bharat Nagar Government School, where Mohan studies, to renovate it and get new books. After watching their son become fluent in English, Shyam and Tulsi search for the identity of the anonymous donor to thank them. However, when he visits the donor's address in Vasant Vihar, Shyam finds out the truth about Raj pretending to be poor to enable Pia's admission and leaves to tell Delhi Grammar School's principal Lodha Singhania of Raj's deceit.\nRaj and Meeta rush to Delhi Grammar School to get there before Shyam but fail. Shyam, reaching there first, tries to find the principal's office but meets Pia instead, where Shyam endures an emotional moment with her and decides not to tell the principal, but Raj reacts with guilt for what he has done. Finally, Raj goes to the principal and asks for Pia's admission to be revoked, while telling the truth, but the principal rejects him. Raj gatecrashes the Annual Day function, gives a speech about English in India and education rights, and leaves, with no one clapping for him, except Meeta. On their way out, Raj & Meeta tell the principal of the Bharat Nagar Government School that they plan to admit Pia to his school to study with Mohan.\n\nCast\nCredits adapted from Bollywood Hungama:\n\nProduction\nMade on a production budget of ₹14 crore, Hindi Medium was produced by Vijan of Maddock Films and Bhushan Kumar of T-Series. The film was directed by Chaudhary, his third after romantic comedy films Pyaar Ke Side Effects (2006) and Shaadi Ke Side Effects (2014). He came up with the idea of making a film about India's education system with his co-writer Zeenat Lakhani during the development of the latter film. They found the idea too extensive to include in Shaadi Ke Side Effects, so after its release, they decided to incorporate the idea into a separate film. Stating the reason to make Hindi Medium, Chaudhary said, \"The subject is so relevant. We realised that today irrespective of the background of the parent, they still want to have the best education for the children.\"\nPre-production work began after the release of Shaadi Ke Side Effects. Chaudhary began working on the story at that time, and he chose Delhi as the film's key location. The production crew consisted primarily of people Chaudhary had worked with on Pyaar Ke Side Effects and Shaadi Ke Side Effects, with the exception of production designer Mustafa Stationwala—they are editor A. Sreekar Prasad; dialogue writer Amitosh Nagpal; and cinematographer Laxman Utekar. The score was composed by Amar Mohile.\nOn 29 May 2016, News18 reported the casting of Saba Qamar in the film, which marked her Bollywood debut. Khan had recommended the casting of Qamar to the makers of the film. He said, \"When I saw her YouTube videos, I recommended her to the director and producer and they really liked her\". Speaking about her role, Qamar said, \"I play a person who didn't get an opportunity to fulfil her dreams so she comes up with a scheme about giving the daughter a life that she didn't have\".\nKhan commented that he had accepted the role as it tackled the realistic subject of the challenges of obtaining a good education in India.\nQamar arrived in Mumbai from Pakistan in July 2016, and the film's principal photography began in the same month. The film was shot in Chandni Chowk, Anand Lok, Karol Bagh, and Sangam Vihar. The shooting was completed in October 2016. A song sequence was also filmed in Georgia. Qamar commented that she enjoyed working with Khan, and felt safe while shooting in Delhi. In the same interview with Pakistani newspaper Dawn, she commented that her experience wasn't affected by the nationalist far-right political party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena's hostility towards Pakistan at the time.\n\nSoundtrack\nHindi Medium's soundtrack consists of two original compositions: \"Hoor\" and \"Ek Jindari\", which were produced by Sachin–Jigar. The songs were written by Priya Saraiya and Kumaar, whereas Atif Aslam and Taniskaa Sanghvi, rendered the vocals. In addition to the original tracks, the makers recreated two songs: \"Suit Suit\", written and sung by Guru Randhawa and Arjun and composed by Randhawa and Rajat Nagpal, and \"Oh Ho Ho Ho\", composed by Sukhbir and Abhijit Vaghani, sung by Sukhbir, rapped by Ikka Singh and written by Kumaar. The album rights of the film were acquired by T-Series, and it was released on 21 April 2017.\nJoginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama, rated the album a 3 out of 5 stars. He said that \"the music of Hindi Medium turns out to be better than expected\", and praised the inclusion of recreations of \"Suit Suit\" and \"Oh Ho Ho Ho\" as they were previously popular Punjabi songs. V. Lakshmi of The Times of India in a positive review of the album said that, \"by the time the album ends, the listeners are left humming the tunes!\". Suanshu Khurana of The Indian Express highlighted the song \"Hoor\" as the best song on the album. The track \"Ek Jindari\" was remade as \"Ek Zindagi\" for the spiritual successor Angrezi Medium (2020), thereby retaining the original composition and vocals from the track.\n\nRelease\nThe film was initially scheduled to release on 12 May 2017, but was pushed by a week back, thereby clashing with Half Girlfriend, scheduled for release on the same date. Hindi Medium was declared 'tax-free' in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi.\nIn February 2018, following the success of Dangal (2016) and Secret Superstar (2017) in China, it was announced that Hindi Medium was to be released in China. Hindi Medium released in China on 4 April 2018 to coincide with the Qingming Festival. The film's Chinese title is 起跑线 (Qi Pao Xian), which means The Starting Line.\n\nControversy\nThe makers of the Bengali film Ramdhanu (2014), directed by the duo Nandita Roy and Shiboprosad Mukherjee, had launched a copyright case against Hindi Medium, claiming that the storyline was similar to their film. In response to this, Chaudhary said \"We have researched our script over a year and it is based on original material. I would request everyone involved to not rush to a judgement without ascertaining the facts. And the facts can easily be confirmed by watching the film.\" Roy and Mukherjee later withdrew their case.\n\nCritical reception\nHindi Medium received a generally positive reception from critics, with particular praise for Khan's and Qamar's performances.\nRohit Bhatnagar of Deccan Chronicle called the film a \"masterpiece\" and praised Khan's and Qamar's acting. Rachit Gupta of Filmfare rated the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and said that it was a \"refreshingly funny and brilliantly insightful film on parenting and education.\" Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India highlighted the script, and the comedic elements of the film as its strengths. Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times giving 3.5 stars out of 5 stars, commented that \"Khan asks the viewers to take a stand against faulty Indian education system\". Samrudhi Ghosh of India Today gave 3 out of 5 stars, praising Khan's and Qamar's performances, said \"Hindi Medium may use over-dramatised events to make its message hit home, but in spite of its hiccups, the film is not bogged down because of the performances and the humour\". Smrity Sharma of India.com rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, and wrote: \"Decent story, humour, a few heart tugging moments and effortless performances by Irrfan Khan, Saba Qamar and Deepak Dobriyal make the movie watchable.\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express giving 2 out of 5 stars, praised Khan's acting however felt that the writing was \"flat\", and that some of the supporting characters were \"more caricature than real\".\nHindi Medium received a generally positive reception from critics outside of India. A reviewer for Time Out gave it 4 out of 5 stars: \"With all its merits, though, the film stumbles near the end with its overly sentimental conclusion.\" The reviewer concluded that \"the film is one of the best Bollywood films\". James Marsh of South China Morning Post rated it 3.5 stars out of 5 stars, calling it \"a classical comedy of manners full of humour and playful performances\". Sadaf Siddique of Dawn observed: \"Chaudhary gets full marks for novelty, he fails to adequately flesh his ideas out\".\nRajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 2.5 stars out of 5, commenting \"Despite its shortcomings, the film is never unwatchable and benefits enormously from a winning performance by Irrfan Khan who makes his every moment on screen count. From his hilarious wooing of a mother-daughter pair of potential customers at his shop in the film's first half to his earnest amends on discovering his conscience late into the final act, he has you eating out of his palm. For Irrfan alone, Hindi Medium may be worth a watch.\"\n\nBox office\nThe film emerged as a sleeper hit at the box office. Its worldwide gross was ₹1.09 billion (US$16.74 million) by July 2017. Within three days of its April 2018 release in China, Hindi Medium crossed ₹1 billion (US$14.62 million) at the Chinese box office, crossing the ₹2 billion (US$29.24 million) mark worldwide, becoming Khan's highest-grossing Hindi film, surpassing his 2013 release The Lunchbox. By 16 April 2018, Hindi Medium had crossed the ₹3 billion (US$43.87 million) mark worldwide, becoming one of the top 20 highest-grossing Indian films at the time.\n\nDomestic\nHindi Medium collected ₹28.1 million (US$431,500.45) on its opening day. It released on the same day as the much bigger budget film, Half Girlfriend (2017), which earned ₹103 million (US$1.58 million) on the first day. Gradually, the film turned to be more successful than the former. After one week, the film grossed ₹252 million (US$3.87 million) at the box office. The film grossed ₹967 million (US$14.85 million) during its lifetime run in Indian theatres. It was one of 2017's top ten most commercially successful Hindi films in India.\n\nOverseas\nThe film grossed ₹143 million (US$2.2 million) overseas in 2017. Following its April 2018 release in China, the film crossed ₹2 billion (US$29.24 million) overseas, becoming the seventh Indian film to cross the $30 million mark at the overseas box office. It also surpassed the overseas gross of 2018's highest-grossing Indian film Padmaavat.\n\nChina\nOn its opening day in China, on 4 April 2018, the film grossed ₹221 million (US$3.23 million). Hindi Medium surpassed Dangal (2016) and Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015) to have the second highest opening day for an Indian film in China, behind only Secret Superstar (2018). The film's opening three-day gross was ₹1.02 billion (US$14.91 million).\nThe film's success is attributed to strong word-of-mouth, helped by a 9.1 rating at the Chinese ticketing website Maoyan, as well as Khan's recognition among Chinese audiences from international films such as Jurassic World, The Amazing Spider-Man, and Life of Pi. The film grossed ₹2.23 billion (US$32.61 million) during its lifetime run at the Chinese box office. This made it the fourth highest-grossing Indian film in China (after Dangal, Secret Superstar and Bajrangi Bhaijaan), until it was surpassed by the 2019 release of Andhadhun (2018) in China.\n\nAwards\nAt the 63rd Filmfare Awards, the film garnered six nominations, winning for Best Film and Best Actor for Khan. Chaudhary won Best Director and Khan won for Best Actor at the 19th IIFA Awards. It received six nominations at the Zee Cine Awards.\n\nSequel\nAfter the success of Hindi Medium, a sequel to the film was planned. Regarding the success of the film, producer Vijan told Mid-Day, \"The response we have got is phenomenal. The entire unit of Hindi Medium, including Irrfan and Saba, who look cool as a couple on-screen, should be repeated in a film. There is definitely scope for a sequel. We would certainly explore it.\" On 24 January 2018, Vijan confirmed the sequel to Times Now. He said, \"We have just finished typing the second part\", with \"Just finishing touches are being put\", however, \"I think you will have to wait for an official announcement for that.\"\nOn 30 March 2019, it was announced that Kareena Kapoor has been added to the cast of the sequel to play the role of a police officer and filming will start from April. On 5 April, the sequel's title was announced as Angrezi Medium and filming began in Udaipur. This was completed in July. On 17 February 2020, the film's release date was changed to 13 March 2020 from the earlier release date of 20 March. This film marked Irrfan Khan's final film before his death on 29 April 2020.\n\nSee also\nList of Bollywood films of 2017\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nHindi Medium at IMDb\nHindi Medium at Rotten Tomatoes"

        "content": "Slovenia participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 with the song \"Sebi\" written and performed by Zala Kralj and Gašper Šantl. Slovenian broadcaster Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTV Slovenija) organised the national final EMA 2019 in order to select the Slovenian entry for the 2019 contest in Tel Aviv, Israel. Ten entries competed in the national final where the winner was selected over two rounds of voting. In the first round, the top two entries were selected by a three-member jury panel. In the second round, \"Sebi\" performed by Zala Kralj and Gašper Šantl was selected as the winner entirely by a public televote.\nSlovenia was drawn to compete in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 14 May 2019. Performing during the show in position 5, \"Sebi\" was announced among the top 10 entries of the first semi-final and hence qualified to compete in the final. It was later revealed that Slovenia placed sixth out of the 17 participating countries in the semi-final with 167 points. In the final, Slovenia performed in position 10 and placed fifteenth out of the 26 participating countries with 105 points.\n\nBackground\nPrior to the 2019 contest, Slovenia had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest twenty-four times since its first entry in 1993. Slovenia's highest placing in the contest, to this point, has been seventh place, which the nation achieved on two occasions: in 1995 with the song \"Prisluhni mi\" performed by Darja Švajger and in 2001 with the song \"Energy\" performed by Nuša Derenda. The country's only other top ten result was achieved in 1997 when Tanja Ribič performing \"Zbudi se\" placed tenth. Since the introduction of semi-finals to the format of the contest in 2004, Slovenia had thus far only managed to qualify to the final on five occasions. In 2018, \"Hvala, ne!\" performed by Lea Sirk qualified to the final and placed twenty-second.\nThe Slovenian national broadcaster, Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTV Slovenija), broadcasts the event within Slovenia and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. RTV Slovenija confirmed Slovenia's participation in the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest on 6 September 2018. The Slovenian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest has traditionally been selected through a national final entitled Evrovizijska Melodija (EMA), which has been produced with variable formats. To this point, the broadcaster has only foregone the use of this national final in 2013 when the Slovenian entry was internally selected. For 2019, the broadcaster opted to organise EMA 2019 to select the Slovenian entry.\n\nBefore Eurovision\nEMA 2019\nEMA 2019 was the 23rd edition of the Slovenian national final format Evrovizijska Melodija (EMA), used by RTV Slovenija to select Slovenia's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2018. The competition took place at the RTV Slovenija Studio 1 in Ljubljana, hosted by Ajda Smrekar and was broadcast on TV SLO1, Radio Val 202, Radio Koper, Radio Maribor and online via the broadcaster's RTV 4D platform. An online backstage broadcast at RTV Slovenija's official website also occurred concurrently with the competition, which was hosted by Tanja Kocman and Rok Bohinc. The national final was watched by 223,900 viewers in Slovenia with a market share of 11%.\n\nFormat\nTen songs competed in a televised show where the winner was selected over two rounds of voting. In the first round, a three-member expert jury selected two finalists out of the ten competing songs to proceed to a superfinal. Each member of the expert jury assigned a score of 1 (lowest score) to 5 (highest score) to each song with the top two being determined by the songs that receive the highest overall scores when the jury votes are combined. Ties were broken by giving priority to the song(s) that achieved a higher number of top scores (5), which would be followed by each juror indicating their preferred song should a tie still have persisted. In the superfinal, public televoting exclusively determined the winner. In case of technical problems with the televote, the jury would have voted to determine the winner in a similar process as in the first round of the competition.\n\nCompeting entries\nArtists and composers were able to submit their entries to the broadcaster between 9 November 2018 and 14 December 2018. 103 entries were received by the broadcaster during the submission period. An expert committee consisting of Lea Sirk (2018 Slovenian Eurovision entrant), Mojca Menart (Head of ZKP RTV Slovenija), Aleksander Radić (Head of the Slovenian delegation at the Eurovision Song Contest) and Žiga Klančar (music editor for Radio Val 202) selected ten artists and songs for the competition from the received submissions. The competing artists were announced on 27 December 2018. Among the competing artists was former Slovenian Junior Eurovision contestant Ula Ložar who represented Slovenia in 2014.\n\nFinal\nEMA 2019 took place on 16 February 2019. In addition to the performances of the competing entries, Smaal Tokk, Inot and 2018 Slovenian Eurovision entrant Lea Sirk performed as guests. The winner was selected over two rounds of voting. In the first round, a three-member jury panel selected two entries to proceed to the second round. The jury consisted of Lea Sirk, Darja Švajger (1995 and 1999 Slovenian Eurovision entrant) and Vladimir Graić (composer of Serbia's winning Eurovision entry \"Molitva\" in 2007). In the second round, a public televote selected \"Sebi\" performed by Zala Kralj and Gašper Šantl as the winner.\n\nPreparation\nFollowing Zala Kralj and Gašper Šantl's win at EMA 2019, the music video of \"Sebi\" was released to the public on 20 February. The video was directed and produced by Žiga Krajnc who previously collaborated with Kralj and Šantl on the music videos for their singles \"Baloni\", \"S teboi\" and \"Valovi\".\n\nAt Eurovision\nAccording to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \"Big Five\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 28 January 2019, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Slovenia was placed into the first semi-final, to be held on 14 May 2019, and was scheduled to perform in the first half of the show.\nOnce all the competing songs for the 2019 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the shows' producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. Slovenia was set to perform in position 5, following the entry from Poland and before the entry from the Czech Republic.\nIn Slovenia, the semi-finals were televised on RTV SLO2 and the final was televised on RTV SLO1 with commentary by Andrej Hofer. The Slovenian spokesperson, who announced the top 12-point score awarded by the Slovenian jury during the final, was Lea Sirk who represented Slovenia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018.\n\nSemi-final\nZala Kralj and Gašper Šantl took part in technical rehearsals on 4 and 9 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 13 and 14 May. This included the jury show on 13 May where the professional juries of each country watched and voted on the competing entries. \nThe Slovenian performance featured Zala Kralj and Gašper Šantl both dressed in white; Kralj performed vocals on stage while Šantl held a guitar behind a mixing keyboard. The stage colours were dark and the LED screens and floor displayed an encircling galaxy and starry night scene. The Slovenian performance was directed by Igorja Zupeta.\nAt the end of the show, Slovenia was announced as having finished in the top 10 and subsequently qualifying for the grand final. It was later revealed that Slovenia placed sixth in the semi-final, receiving a total of 167 points: 93 points from the televoting and 74 points from the juries.\n\nFinal\nShortly after the first semi-final, a winners' press conference was held for the ten qualifying countries. As part of this press conference, the qualifying artists took part in a draw to determine which half of the grand final they would subsequently participate in. This draw was done in the order the countries were announced during the semi-final. Slovenia was drawn to compete in the first half. Following this draw, the shows' producers decided upon the running order of the final, as they had done for the semi-finals. Slovenia was subsequently placed to perform in position 10, following the entry from Sweden and before the entry from Cyprus.\nZala Kralj and Gašper Šantl once again took part in dress rehearsals on 17 and 18 May before the final, including the jury final where the professional juries cast their final votes before the live show. The duo performed a repeat of their semi-final performance during the final on 18 May. Slovenia placed fifteenth in the final, scoring 105 points: 59 points from the televoting and 46 points from the juries.\n\nVoting\nVoting during the three shows involved each country awarding two sets of points from 1–8, 10 and 12: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting. Each nation's jury consisted of five music industry professionals who are citizens of the country they represent, with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency. This jury judged each entry based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury was permitted to be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member as well as the nation's televoting results will be released shortly after the grand final.\nBelow is a breakdown of points awarded to Slovenia and awarded by Slovenia in the first semi-final and grand final of the contest, and the breakdown of the jury voting and televoting conducted during the two shows:\n\nPoints awarded to Slovenia\nPoints awarded by Slovenia\nDetailed voting results\nThe following members comprised the Slovene jury:\n\nŽiga Klančar (jury chairperson) – music editor, head of music programme\nUrša Mihevc – singer, composer\nUla Ložar – singer, represented Slovenia in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2014\nMate Bro – musician, singer, composer, producer\nUrša Vlašič – lyricist\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial RTV Slovenija Eurovision website (in Slovene)"

        "content": "The San Jose Earthquakes are an American professional soccer club based in San Jose, California.  The Earthquakes compete as a member club of the Western Conference of Major League Soccer (MLS). Originally as the San Jose Clash, the franchise began play in 1996 as one of the charter members of the league. The Earthquakes took part in the first game in MLS history, defeating D.C. United 1–0. The Earthquakes have won two MLS Cup titles (2001, 2003) and two Supporters' Shields (2005, 2012). In 2002, the team played in its first CONCACAF Champions Cup, making it to the quarterfinals. \nThe team holds a fierce rivalry with the LA Galaxy known as the California Clásico.\nIn 2005, the then-owner of the Earthquakes, Anschutz Entertainment Group, announced plans of the team relocating to Houston due to failing efforts to secure a soccer-specific stadium in San Jose. The organization in Houston would be considered an expansion team by the league, eventually becoming the Houston Dynamo, which began play in 2006. The Earthquakes returned after a two-year hiatus, resuming play in 2008. Since 2015, the Earthquakes have played their home games at PayPal Park (named Avaya Stadium from 2015 to 2019 and Earthquakes Stadium in 2020). The team previously played its home games at Buck Shaw Stadium on the Santa Clara University campus in Santa Clara, California, from 2008 to 2014.\n\nHistory\nSan Jose Earthquakes (1974)\nIn 1974, the Earthquakes became a franchise of the North American Soccer League where they competed during the duration of the league's shortlived existence. Playing out of San Jose, the Earthquakes hosted world-class players like George Best on their own roster while receiving visiting star talent like Brazilian football legend, Pele.\n\nFounding and early years (1994–1999)\nIn 1994, Daniel Van Voorhis, former owner of the American Professional Soccer League's San Jose Hawks, successfully led a San Jose bidding group that was awarded one of Major League Soccer's inaugural teams. At that time, he handed over all existing Hawks player contracts, front-office resources and the rights to play in San Jose State University's Spartan Stadium to MLS in exchange for Type C stock in the league. He also became the franchise's investor-operator until outside concerns forced him to divest himself of these positions prior to the league's launch and accept a buyout from the league, leaving the franchise league-owned for several years. Meanwhile, a direct connection to the earlier Earthquakes came in the person of Peter Bridgwater, named as general manager of the MLS team. Although Bridgwater still owned the rights to the Earthquakes name and logo, the team became known as the Clash at the urging of Nike, a major investor in MLS.\nOn December 7, 1995, Bridgwater hired Laurie Calloway as the team's first coach, providing a second direct connection with the NASL Earthquakes, as well as a connection with the Hawks. On January 23, 1996, the Clash acquired US national team star Eric Wynalda, despite the fact that Wynalda and Calloway did not get along during their time together with the Hawks. The Clash's connections to the Blackhawks continued when the club made the first trade in MLS history, sending Rhett Harty to the MetroStars for Troy Dayak.\nSan Jose was an integral part of the launching of MLS, hosting the league's inaugural game at Spartan Stadium before a crowd of 31,683 on April 6, 1996. The crowd did not go away disappointed as San Jose won its first game on the first goal in MLS history from Eric Wynalda, defeating D.C. United 1–0. One month later, the club made history again, as they hosted the Los Angeles Galaxy in a match that drew 31,728 fans to Spartan Stadium, setting the record for attendance at a sporting event in the city of San Jose. But Wynalda and Calloway were soon at each other's throats again, eventually leading to a locker room brawl between Wynalda and John Doyle. The skirmish reached memorable proportions when Wynalda hired an airplane to tow a banner demanding Calloway's firing.\nAlthough the Clash made the postseason in the inaugural MLS season in 1996, and Doyle earned recognition as the best MLS defender, the team floundered in 1997. By mid-season the team was sinking fast and Bridgwater fired Calloway and replaced him with Brian Quinn. The Clash finished 1997 at the bottom of the Western Conference standings with a 12–20 record. Things were no better in 1998, when the team finished 13–19 and well out of playoff contention. During the 1999 pre-season, the saga of player-coach antagonism continued when Richard Gough left the team after an argument with Quinn. By the end of 1999, Quinn was done and the team released him to hire Lothar Osiander.\n\nReturn of the Earthquakes (1999–2005)\nThe franchise's official name changed from the Clash to the Earthquakes on October 27, 1999, as the historic name had better recognition among fans in the area. After missing four consecutive post-seasons with three different coaches, the Earthquakes hired head coach Frank Yallop days before the 2001 MLS SuperDraft.  Yallop's personnel changes and deft coaching with the help of assistant coach Dominic Kinnear and goalkeeper coach Tim Hanley, along with the allocation of star forward Landon Donovan on loan from Bayer Leverkusen, quickly turned around the Earthquakes' on-field fortunes, spurring the biggest regular season turnaround in league history (from 29 points in 2000 to 45 points in 2001) and leading the team to a 2–1 MLS Cup 2001 overtime victory over the archrival Los Angeles Galaxy.\nThe Quakes followed with two consecutive runners-up finishes for the MLS Supporters' Shield and a 4–2 MLS Cup 2003 win over the Chicago Fire. Prior to reaching the 2003 final, the Earthquakes had rallied from four goals down to beat the Galaxy, 5–4 on aggregate, in a first-round playoff that many MLS watchers described as the greatest in league history. Following the season, Yallop returned to his native Canada to coach the Canadian men's national soccer team being named to the post on December 16. Assistant coach Kinnear was then promoted to head coach, and former San Jose player John Doyle was named as his assistant.\nHaving won two MLS Cup titles in three years, the Earthquakes were poised for greater success both on and off the field.  However, in January 2004, general manager Johnny Moore, whose roots with the club dated back to his days as a player for the NASL Earthquakes, resigned after AEG and MLS considered allowing the team to be rebranded as San Jose America (with ownership to transfer to the owners of Mexico's Club América).  Earthquake fans were similarly outraged at the proposed rebranding, coming just months after the MLS Cup. Former Los Angeles Galaxy defender Alexi Lalas was named as Moore's replacement. Under Lalas' management, the club planned a move to Houston. Meanwhile, when the Quakes' star player, Landon Donovan, played briefly in Germany, Lalas traded away his rights, enabling Lalas' former team, the Galaxy, to acquire him.\nOn the field, Kinnear led the team to two more playoff appearances, including an MLS Supporters' Shield win in 2005.\n\nHiatus and return (2006–2008)\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2005 season, Earthquakes owner Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) were granted permission to potentially move the team if a local buyer could not be found within a 30-day window. After a city-led plan to build a soccer-specific stadium was rejected, AEG announced on December 15 that the team would move to Houston for the 2006 season. MLS announced that the Earthquakes name, colors, logo, wordmark, history and competitive records would not be transferred, similar to the Cleveland Browns deal in the National Football League, to be used by a future San Jose team. The San Jose franchise was officially put on hiatus while the players, head coach Dominic Kinnear and some of his coaching staff were moved to Houston; the team were initially named Houston 1836 and later the Houston Dynamo. The Houston Dynamo is technically considered an expansion team by MLS just as the Baltimore Ravens is by the NFL.\n\nOn May 24, 2006, an agreement was reached between Major League Soccer and the principal owners of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, Lewis Wolff and John Fisher, granting them a three-year exclusive option to develop a soccer-specific stadium and bring an expansion franchise to the San Francisco Bay Area. An expansion team under the Earthquakes name was formally awarded to the duo by MLS on July 18, 2007. While functionally being the 14th franchise to join MLS, the team retained all records, logos, colors and titles of the 1996–2005 franchise and is a continuation of that franchise. Michael Crowley, also Oakland A's president at the time, led the relaunched franchise and served as president until 2010.\nIn October 2007, the Earthquakes announced they would be moving their offices from the Fairmont Hotel in downtown San Jose to an office park across the street from their temporary home, Buck Shaw Stadium, and across the Caltrain tracks from the location of the former FMC site. On November 6, 2007, the team announced that former Earthquakes coach Frank Yallop was returning to the team as head coach. According to ESPN.com, the Earthquakes compensated Yallop's previous employer, the Los Angeles Galaxy, with a third-round pick in the 2008 MLS SuperDraft.\n\nReturn to MLS\nIn 2008, England's Darren Huckerby, the MLS Newcomer of the Year and Ireland's Ronnie O'Brien, who made 28 appearances for the Earthquakes, helped anchor the offense, combining for 10 goals and 10 assists. Both played a key part of the team's nine-game unbeaten streak that saw San Jose push towards a playoff berth. They also failed to qualify for the U.S. Open Cup, losing to Real Salt Lake 4–0 in the first round of qualifying.\nOn January 27, 2009, Amway Global signed a three-year deal with the Earthquakes to become the team's official jersey sponsor. The club made a historic trade on June 9, 2009, when they acquired Chris Wondolowski from Houston.\nThe Quakes missed out on the playoffs for a second consecutive season in 2009 but looked to build on a solid second half of the year, which saw them go 4–4–4 following the All-Star Break. The Earthquakes finished in 14th place and failed to qualify for the playoffs. The Earthquakes also failed to qualify for the U.S. Open Cup, losing to New York Red Bulls on April 29, 2–1.\nIn 2010, the San Jose Earthquakes qualified for the playoffs as the West's No. 6 seed with 46 points. In the 2010 MLS playoffs, they were matched up with the No. 1 seeded New York Red Bulls. After losing the first game by a score of 1–0, the Earthquakes defeated the Red Bulls in the second game by a score of 3–1 to win the aggregate, 3–2, and upset New York. In the single-elimination semi-final match against the Colorado Rapids, at Colorado, the Quakes suffered a 1–0 defeat.\nIn 2011, the San Jose Earthquakes missed the playoffs after they finished seventh in the west and fourteenth in all of MLS.\n\nThe Goonies (2012–2014)\nIn 2012, the San Jose Earthquakes had the best start in franchise history. The team established a habit of scoring late goals to tie or win games. The first was a match against Real Salt Lake on April 21, 2012, scoring 2 goals in stoppage time to win 3–1. The next week, a stoppage time goal produced a win against the Philadelphia Union. Two more games resulted in ties with late goals, both scored by Alan Gordon. On May 23, 2012, against the L.A. Galaxy, the Quakes scored 3 times in 18 minutes to win 3–2. After this game striker Steven Lenhart declared \"Goonies never say die!\" (a reference to the movie The Goonies), and this was made into the rally cry of the team.\nThe Quakes ended the 2012 regular season with 66 points and 72 goals, both team records, with 17 of those points created by goals scored in the 84th minute or later. The team clinched the Supporter's Shield, its first major trophy since their return to San Jose, and qualified for their first CONCACAF Champion's League tournament as a franchise in 2013. They returned to the playoffs for the first time since their 2010 season and faced two games against L.A. Galaxy. In their first playoff game, the Quakes scored a stoppage time goal to take the away leg 1–0, but were knocked out of the playoffs following a 3–1 loss at home (3–2 on aggregate), their only loss at Buck Shaw Stadium for the season.\n\nIn 2013, the Quakes began the year facing adversity with numerous players recovering from injury. With added depth in preparation for the upcoming CONCACAF Champions' League, they began the task of duplicating the success of 2012. While the style of scoring late goals were still present in games against New York, Portland and Montreal, the team struggled to find success and quickly found themselves at the bottom of the Western Conference. The slow start of the team led to the departure of coach Frank Yallop and Mark Watson was named interim coach.\nOn June 29, 2013, the Quakes played the L.A. Galaxy in the California Clásico. Despite being down 2–0 and having Victor Bernardez ejected, the Quakes staged another comeback, scoring twice in stoppage time to win 3–2, becoming the first MLS team to do so.\nOn August 7, 2013, the Earthquakes debuted in the 2013–14 CONCACAF Champions League for the first time since their return to MLS. They lost the away game to the Montreal Impact 1–0. On October 23, 2013, the Earthquakes won group five on goal differential with a win at home against Heredia, and they moved on to the knockout stage of the tournament.\nDespite a league best record in games played after June, the Quakes failed to qualify for the 2013 playoffs, losing the final spot to Colorado on a goal differential tiebreaker. The final home game of the season, a 2–0 win against FC Dallas, saw the final minutes of professional soccer for Ramiro Corrales, who had announced his retirement. Corrales was the last remaining active player who played in the inaugural season of MLS.\nThe Quakes in their 2014 campaign began, playing in the quarterfinals against Toluca in a two-game series in the 2013–14 CONCACAF Champions League. Scoring a goal in stoppage time in the first game, the Quakes went to Mexico 1–1 on aggregate. In the second game, the game tied in regulation. The Quakes faced Toluca in Overtime where neither team could score against the other and the game went on to penalties. The Earthquakes lost 5–4 against Toluca in penalties and were eliminated.\nSan Jose ended the 2014 MLS Season with the club's worst ever record, winning only 6 matches, and suffering a 15-match winless streak. That streak surpassed the Quakes' previous record of 13 in 2011, and matched the second worst in league history.\n\nReturn of Dominic Kinnear (2015–2017)\nThe Earthquakes welcomed back Dominic Kinnear to the club as coach after a nine-year tenure in Houston. The franchise's long-awaited stadium, Avaya Stadium, was the first professional soccer-specific stadium in the Bay Area when it opened on March 22.\nThe 2015 season was a marked improvement over the previous season, but the Earthquakes still failed to reach the playoffs despite a late surge. Chris Wondolowski became only the ninth player in MLS history to score 100 goals with a penalty in a 1–1 draw against Orlando.\nOn August 29, 2016, the Earthquakes parted ways with longtime general manager John Doyle. Earthquakes President Dave Kaval stated that he felt the Earthquakes \"needed a fresh approach\". Technical director Chris Leitch was appointed as interim GM.\n\nThe Fioranelli era (2017–2021)\nFollowing the firing of John Doyle, it was announced on January 5, 2017, that Jesse Fioranelli had been hired as general manager. He joined San Jose from A.S. Roma and had previously also worked at Roma's cross-city rival S.S. Lazio.\nFioranelli made clear early on that he would be prioritizing youth development, international scouting, and generally creating a new identity for San Jose that was younger, more dynamic, and more attacking, intentions which were reflected by his off-season acquisitions of Jahmir Hyka, Florian Jungwirth, Marco Ureña, Harold Cummings, and Danny Hoesen using Targeted Allocation Money. He also expressed the necessity of the team reaching the playoffs in 2017, as it had not done so since 2012. Illustrating the seriousness of his commitment to improving San Jose, within one week in April Fioranelli made two key additions to the technical staff with the hiring of Alex Covelo as Director of Methodology and Bruno Costa as Head of Scouting. Dave Kaval stepped down from his role as president on June 1, to be replaced by former Aston Villa F.C. chief executive and Arsenal F.C. chief commercial officer Tom Fox. On June 22, 2017, San Jose announced Fioranelli's first Designated Player signing, Georgian attacking midfielder Vako, who would join San Jose from SBV Vitesse.\nFioranelli took his ambitions for San Jose a step further just several days later, when he announced on June 25, 2017, that Dominic Kinnear had been fired, and would be replaced immediately and permanently by Chris Leitch, the club's technical director and former interim general manager. Assistant coach John Spencer was also let go, and was replaced by Covelo. The timing of the firing came as somewhat of a surprise, as it was announced hours after San Jose defeated Real Salt Lake 2–1 at home. Fioranelli said of the firing that, coming off of a win, it was not reactionary, and rather he had \"in the last two to three months...matured a gut feeling as to where [the club stands]\", and that his respect for Kinnear \"would not have allowed [him] to want to go for another three months knowing [they] would have parted ways at the end of the season\". In his first interview as head coach, Leitch reiterated Fioranelli's previously stated goals, saying that \"the goal of the team...is [to] make the playoffs\". His first outing as head coach on June 28, 2017, was successful, seeing the Earthquakes achieve their first-ever victory over an MLS side in the U.S. Open Cup with a 2–1 victory against Seattle Sounders FC that would advance them to the USOC quarter finals for the first time since 2012.\nLeitch's first MLS match as head coach was a 2–1 win over the LA Galaxy at Stanford Stadium on July 1, in which Chris Wondolowski scored the equalizing goal off of an assist from goalkeeper David Bingham and substitute Shea Salinas scored the winner in the 93rd minute. The team experienced its first loss under Leitch three days later on July 4 at Bobby Dodd Stadium, in a 4–2 loss to Atlanta United FC following red cards to both Kofi Sarkodie and Victor Bernardez; however, this match also saw Tommy Thompson score his first league goal and Chris Wondolowski break Ramiro Corrales' record for career starts at San Jose with his 229th start, as well as tie the league record for most goals scored away at 63.\nOn July 7, 2017, a multi-year collaboration between the Earthquakes and the German Football Association was announced, \"focused on knowledge exchange, game development and machine learning\".\nOn July 10, 2017, the Earthquakes defeated the Galaxy 3–2 at home, following a brace from Chris Wondolowski and Danny Hoesen's second goal of the tournament, to advance to the semifinals of the U.S. Open Cup for the first time since 2004 and for only the second time in club history. Wondolowski wore the number 38 in this match in honor of teammate Matheus Silva, who nearly drowned the previous week. New signing Vako was introduced at the club for the first time during halftime. Vako made his club debut four days later as a 63rd minute substitution in San Jose's 4–1 friendly defeat of Eintracht Frankfurt, and shortly afterwards scored in his MLS debut as a halftime substitute against the New York Red Bulls at Red Bull Arena on July 19.\nThe Earthquakes announced a second new partnership aimed at pursuing the implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning on July 21 with Los Angeles-based company Second Spectrum, Inc., the first of its kind in the league and inspired by the company's partnerships with the NBA and specifically the Golden State Warriors. Per this agreement, a new system was installed at Avaya Stadium to track players during matches and gather data on tactics and performance, to be delivered to players' mobile devices directly after games. The signing of Swiss defender François Affolter from FC Luzern was announced later the same day.\nSan Jose lost in the Open Cup semifinals to Sporting Kansas City, for the second time in franchise history, in sudden death penalties on August 9.\nOn August 19, Wondolowski became the first player in MLS history to score ten or more goals in eight consecutive seasons, following his successful penalty kick in the dying moments of a 2–2 home draw against the Philadelphia Union, when Shea Salinas was tripped in the box by Joshua Yaro.\nSan Jose qualified for the 2017 MLS Cup Playoffs, the club's first playoff appearance since 2012, following a 3–2 win at home on October 22 over Minnesota United FC in which Danny Hoesen and Chris Wondolowski each recorded a goal and an assist, and substitute Marco Ureña scored the stoppage time winner. This sent the team on to play a knockout round match on the road against Vancouver Whitecaps FC on October 25. However, the team was defeated 5–0.\nOn November 24, 2017, Mikael Stahre, formerly of BK Häcken, was announced as the team's new head coach. Leitch returned to his previous role as the club's technical director. San Jose began to make roster moves not long after with contract options being declined for players, most notably for defender Víctor Bernárdez and goalkeeper David Bingham who spent six and seven years with the Earthquakes organization respectively. San Jose traded Bingham's MLS rights to their rival Los Angeles Galaxy on December 18. December also brought additions to the roster, reflecting different aspects of San Jose's leadership and management. On December 1, 2017, Joel Qwiberg was signed from IF Brommapojkarna where he had helped to lead the team to two consecutive promotions, reaching Sweden's topic league. The next signing of the off-season was homegrown goalkeeper JT Marcinkowski, who had finished his 3rd year at Georgetown. Just over a week later, San Jose announced in a joint press conference with their USL affiliate Reno 1868 that they had signed three players from the team: Luis Felipe, Chris Wehan, and Jimmy Ockford. Reno's club president elaborated on what the signings meant for both organizations, stating \"Today's news delivers on that promise to compete in Reno while developing the future of San Jose.\" The next day San Jose continued on their developmental based signings with defender Jacob Akanyirige announced as signed straight from their academy at fifteen years old, San Jose's youngest ever player and the eighth youngest player in MLS history. On December 20, the first Designated Player and second Swedish signing under Stahre's tenure was officially brought to San Jose. Magnus Eriksson joined from Djurgårdens IF where he co-led the Allsvenskan as top scorer in the 2017 season.\nStahre was dismissed by the club before the end of his first year in charge, a season in which the team earned just four wins. On October 8, 2018, the club announced that they had hired reigning CONCACAF coach of the year Matias Almeyda, who would take charge for the 2019 season. On May 18, 2019, Wondolowski scored four goals against Chicago Fire. With his second goal, he set the league's all-time scoring record. The team had a negative record and missed the playoffs by four points.\nIn 2020, the Earthquakes had a draw and a loss in their first two regular season games before the season was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When the season resumed with the MLS is Back tournament, the Earthquakes were drawn into Group B with FC Dallas (later replaced by the Chicago Fire), Seattle Sounders FC, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC. They drew with Seattle and defeated both Chicago and Vancouver, the latter with a thrilling comeback from a 3–1 deficit, to win the group and advance to the round of 16.\nOn April 18, 2022, the Earthquakes and Matias Almeyda agreed to part ways. Alex Covelo, the head coach of the newly established San Jose Earthquakes II side, stepped in as his interim replacement. Covelo was joined by an assistant coaching staff consisting of former San Jose player Chris Wondolowski, former assistant manager and interim manager Steve Ralston, and Earthquakes II assistant Luciano Fusco.\n\nCrest and jerseys\nSince their inception, the Earthquakes have played in a color scheme featuring blue and black as dominant colors, usually with white highlights. The original San Jose Clash logo featured a stylized scorpion in black and red with a white 'clash' wordmark.\nWhen they rebranded to the Earthquakes in 2000, the team badge featured an inverted triangular shield containing a soccer ball invoking the rising sun used in the logo for the City of San Jose, a stylized 'Earthquakes' wordmark, and a color palette of blue, black, white and silver. The three points of the triangular shield represented the three largest communities of the Bay Area (San Jose, San Francisco and Oakland).\nThe team rebranded again on January 30, 2014, to a new crest and uniform. While still featuring blue and black, as well as a new chevron design that invokes the geologic theme of the team's name, the new design also featured the year 1974 in red; this is an explicit reference of lineage to the previous NASL incarnation of the Earthquakes that had founded that year.\nOn February 17, 2017, San Jose released its new home kit at a jersey release party at San Pedro Square. The new kit is black, a callback to the black Goonies kits of the historic 2012 season, and features the blue slipstrike design from the crest on the front. Also included is a red neck tape, referring again to the team's NASL history, \"SJ 74\" in blue on the bottom left corner, and the words \"UNITY\", \"DEVOTION\", and \"HERITAGE\" written in white across the blue border on the right sleeve.\nOn February 11, 2018, the Earthquakes released their new away kit, the Navy SEAL Foundation Jersey, and announced that 5% of each jersey sale would be donated to the Foundation, becoming the first club in MLS history to donate part of its jersey revenue to a nonprofit organization. The jersey release party was held near the site of the USS Hornet Museum and the kit itself presented by a retired SEAL alongside squad members Tommy Thompson, Joel Qwiberg, and, offshore in a military rescue boat, Nick Lima and Jackson Yueill.\nThe 2020-2021 away jersey incorporated the colors of the flag of San Jose (blue, white, yellow).\n\nUniform history\nHome\n\nAway\n\nStadium\nU.S. Open Cup:\n\nNegoesco Stadium: San Francisco, California (July 24, 2001) vs LA Galaxy\nCagan Stadium: Stanford, California (2011–2012)\nKezar Stadium: San Francisco, California (2012, 2014)\n\nOn January 13, 2007, the San Jose Mercury News reported that the city of San Jose, San Jose State University and the Earthquakes owners were in negotiations to build a soccer stadium just east of the Earthquakes' previous home, Spartan Stadium. The new facility, to have 22,000 permanent seats but be expandable to a capacity of 30,000 for single games, would be privately built by Lewis Wolff and John Fisher, the primary owners of the Earthquakes, with San Jose State providing the needed land. Additionally, the team and the university would build community soccer fields across Senter Road in Kelley Park using San Jose municipal bond money that had been approved years earlier for the purpose but never spent. The plan was for the new version of the San Jose Earthquakes to play in Spartan Stadium during the 2008 MLS season, then move into the new stadium in 2009. Plans for the stadium collapsed on April 19 of that year after the Earthquakes and SJSU could not come to an agreement on revenue sharing.\n\nPayPal Park\nOn May 8, the city of San Jose and Earthquakes Soccer, LLC confirmed that their new primary focus was on a site near San Jose International Airport on the site of the former FMC plant. The new site was owned by the city, which was exploring either leasing it to Earthquakes Soccer, LLC or selling it outright. The 75-acre (30 ha) site is adjacent to not only the airport but the planned BART extension to Santa Clara and the existing Santa Clara Caltrain station, and near both Interstate 880 and U.S. Route 101. On June 12, 2007, the San Jose City Council voted unanimously to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to explore construction of a new stadium to bring MLS back to San Jose and adopted a resolution authorizing the city manager to enter into an Exclusive Right to Negotiate agreement with Wolff and his partners regarding the potential development of the former FMC site. The first payment on the new stadium land of $3 million was made in June 2008.\nThe preliminary designs were released to the public on September 19, 2009. Earthquakes Stadium was slated to be a three-sided European style stadium with 18,000 permanent seats and a grass berm at the open end.\nOn March 16, 2010, the San Jose city council voted 9–0 to rezone the Airport West property to allow for development of the new Earthquakes Stadium.\nThe San Jose Earthquakes franchise made history when 6,256 people participated in groundbreaking for the new stadium. This set a world record by Guinness World Records as the largest ever crowd to participate in a groundbreaking ceremony. The construction was completed in early 2015 and hosted its first event, a friendly, pre-season match against LA Galaxy, on February 28, 2015. The stadium's official opening took place on March 22, 2015, when the Earthquakes hosted Chicago Fire for their first home game of the 2015 MLS regular season. Fatai Alashe scored the first official, regular-season goal at Avaya in the fifth minute of the 2–1 victory.\n\nClub culture\nRivalries\nThe California Clásico is a rivalry between two Major League Soccer teams, the LA Galaxy and the San Jose Earthquakes, which existed from 1996 to 2005 and was resumed in 2008. It is considered to be one of the oldest rivalries in American soccer. The rivalry originated from the historical Northern California vs. Southern California sporting and cultural rivalries, as well as from the relative proximity of the cities (about 360 miles apart) which allows rival fans to attend each other's games. While there have been several players to play for both teams beforehand, the rivalry intensified after the Anschutz Entertainment Group (owner of the Los Angeles Galaxy) took sole ownership of the San Jose Earthquakes in December 2002. The rivalry reached its peak from 2001 to 2005, during which time the Earthquakes and the Galaxy combined to win four MLS Cup titles in a five-year period. Both clubs reached MLS Cup 2001, with San Jose posting a 2–1 overtime victory on goals by Landon Donovan and Dwayne DeRosario.\nThe Heritage Cup with Seattle Sounders FC was begun in the 2009 MLS season by the respective supporters' groups. Any present or future MLS teams that carry on the names of their NASL predecessors are eligible for the Cup, but supporters of the other eligible MLS teams (Portland Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps FC) have chosen not to participate. San Jose and Seattle have had a rivalry since the NASL. However, it did not completely resurface during the 2009 season with fans of both teams viewing other clubs as bigger rivals. That season, the first MLS meeting of the teams was not considered for the competition due to the schedule consisting of two games in Seattle and only one in San Jose. Seattle won the initial meeting at home 2–0 and the second 2–1. The Earthquakes won the inaugural cup on goals scored after a 4–0 home victory on August 2, 2009.\n\nSupport\nAmong the supporters' groups affiliated with the Earthquakes are the San Jose Ultras, Club Quake, Soccer Silicon Valley, The Casbah, The Faultline, and Epicentro74.\nAn Earthquakes fan was arrested for assaulting a Portland Timbers fan after taunting the group in April 2013. The 1906 Ultras responded via Twitter: \"arrests issue addressed\" and to be \"moving beyond the issue\" ahead of a travel ban that was lifted by Major League Soccer just days prior.\nPunk musician, Lars Frederiksen is a supporter of the Earthquakes. Along with his band, The Old Firm Casuals, he wrote the new anthem and theme song, \"Never Say Die\", for the club, which was performed as part of the team's rebranding ceremony on January 30, 2014. The song features backing vocals by various team members. Frederiksen said of the team that they are the most \"punk rock\" team in the MLS.\n\nMascots\nJosé Clash (1996–1999)\nRikter the CyberDog (2000–2002)\nQ (2004–2005), (2008–present)\nThere was no mascot in 2003.\nOn April 26, 2010, Q was one of three mascots featured on KNTV, along with San Jose Sharks mascot S.J. Sharkie and San Jose Giants mascot \"Gigante\".\n\nRevenue and profitability\nAt the beginning of 2013, the Quakes had 5,000 season ticket holders, and although revenues had been increasing, the Quakes stadium did not allow them to generate sufficient revenues to be profitable.  Quakes management predicted in 2013 that season ticket sales would double once they move into their new stadium, and the Quakes would become profitable at that time. Management also stated that they are \"pursuing independent revenue streams that will provide the team with real and lasting financial freedom.\" With the completion of their new soccer-specific Avaya Stadium, in early 2015 the Earthquakes reached their cap of 12,000 season tickets sold.\n\nSponsorship\nBroadcasting\nFrom 2023, every Earthquakes game will be carried on MLS Season Pass on the Apple TV app, with select national games on Fox or Fox Sports 1. Prior to the streaming deal, the Earthquakes were seen on TV across the Bay Area on a number of stations, with the most recent linear partner being cable outlets NBC Sports Bay Area and NBC Sports California.\nOn the radio, all Earthquakes games are broadcast in English on 810 KGO (since 2023) and in Spanish on 1370 KZSF (since 2011). The English-language broadcast features Ted Ramey as the play-by-play announcer, and former Earthquakes goalkeeper Joe Cannon as the color analyst. Carlos César Rivera serves as the Spanish-language play-by-play announcer, while former Quakes defender Ramiro Corrales is the analyst.\n\nPlayers and staff\nRoster\nAs of July 23, 2024\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Although Dawner and Princess Sylias are childhood friends and also engaged, she does not remember who he is. Whenever she mentions Dawner to the denizens of the demon castle, she calls him, \"Daw-What's-His-Name\". Due to Dawner being outgoing and friendly to Princess Syalis, yet being incredibly clumsy and prone to mistakes, he had always annoyed her, thus causing her to have nightmares when at one point he enters her dreams. He is also known for his poor sense of direction, which explains why Princess Syalis has been captured for a year, along with Syalis' unwillingness to escape.\nQuilladillo (はりとげマジロ, Hari Toge Majiro)\nVoiced by: Rikiya Koyama (Japanese); Ben Lepley (English)\nOne of Twilight's henchmen.

        "content": "Burley in Wharfedale is a village and civil parish in West Yorkshire, England, in the Wharfedale valley. In 2011, it had a population of 7,041.\nThe village is on the A65 road, 11 miles (18 km) north-west from Leeds, 8 miles (13 km) north from Bradford, 3 miles (5 km) from Ilkley and 2 miles (3 km) from Otley. The hamlet of Burley Woodhead at the foot of Burley Moor is 1 mile (1.6 km) to the south-west.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of Burley in Wharfedale is first attested in an eleventh-century copy of a charter issued in 972, as Burhleg. It appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 in the spellings Burgelei, Burgelay, Burghelai, and Burghelay. The comes from the Old English words burg ('fortification') and lēah ('open land in a wood'), and thus meant 'open land in a wood, characterised by a fortification'. The specification 'in Wharfedale', deployed to avoid ambiguity with the various other English places of the same name, is first attested during the reign of Edward I of England, in the forms Burghlay in Querfildale and Burghlay in Quervesdale.\n\nHistory\nBurley in Wharfedale was originally a small agricultural community with likely Roman and Anglo-Saxon roots. Burley developed in the late 18th and 19th centuries into an industrial village with many residents employed at Greenholme Mills, cotton mills powered from a goit fed from the River Wharfe. The cotton mill no longer operates and has recently been converted to flats, but the goit is now utilised to provide hydro electric power, and a weir remains.\nThe development of industrial and commercial centres in the nearby cities of Leeds and Bradford, combined with rail and bus links, caused major changes to the village in the early 20th century. Council housing was built in the 1920s and 1950s, as the village became a dormitory settlement for the two cities. With developments in the second half of the 20th century, Burley became a prosperous but socially diverse village. The village has a high percentage of elderly and retired people, and young families attracted by job opportunities, local schools and new housing developments.\nBurley was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Otley, from 1866 Burley in Wharfedale was a civil parish in its own right, on 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished and merged with Ilkley. In 1931 the parish had a population of 3961.\nOn 1 April 2006, following a petition to the local authority and permission from the Parliament, Burley became a separate parish again under the name \"Burley\".\n\nCommunity\nBurley population is 7,041. With Menston, Burley is part of Wharfedale ward in the metropolitan borough of the City of Bradford.\nThe village contains a range of local businesses. Burley public buildings include the Queens' Hall, originally built as a lecture hall for mill workers. Recent work by community groups has resulted in developments including a new nature reserve, and the village green which contains a central water feature.\nThe village has two state primary schools, Burley and Woodhead Primary School, Burley Oaks Primary School, and Ghyll Royd School & Pre-School, a private primary and nursery school for girls and boys aged 2–11. The school was established in 1889 by Augustus Wooldridge Godby. Formerly an all boys school, it became a co-educational school in 1999 when it moved location to Greystone Manor.\n\nBurley's churches are those of the Anglicans, Calvinists and Methodists. The Roman Catholic church, dedicated to Saints John Fisher and Thomas More, is located between Burley in Wharfedale and Menston. The Anglican Parish Church is dedicated to St Mary.\nBurley has a range of housing types and age, and terrace houses and cottages at the centre. Scalebor Park Hospital has been converted into private townhouses and flats.\nBurley has a railway station on the Wharfedale Line, with direct trains to Leeds, Bradford and Ilkley, and links to other local urban areas.\n\nNotable people\nBurley Woodhead was home to the television presenter Richard Whiteley until his death in 2005. It may have been the birthplace of Walter of Burley (1274–1344), a medieval English logician and theologian. William Forster, reforming 19th-century politician was part owner of a mill in the village and is buried there. Mark James, Ryder Cup captain in 1999, lives in the village. British cyclist Scott Thwaites is from Burley; in 2012, he became the Men's Elite Road Race Champion in the National road cycling championships held at Otley. Magistrate and treasurer to the County Courts of Yorkshire John Peele Clapham commissioned Burley Grange and the Salem Church on Main Street.\nTom Sumner was awarded an MBE in 2000 for \"For services to the community in Burley-in-Wharfdale [sic], West Yorkshire.\"\n\nLocation grid\nSee also\nListed buildings in Burley in Wharfedale\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nBurley in Wharfedale Community Website\nBurley Parish Council Website\nBurley in Wharfedale Community Trust Website\nBurley-in-Wharfedale bridge campaign\nBurley Oaks Primary School"

        "content": "The Brachyceran family Vermileonidae (the sole family in the infraorder Vermileonomorpha) is a small family of uncertain affinities and unusual biology. It includes fewer than 80 described species, most of them rare and with restricted distribution, in 11 genera. Historically the vermileonids had been regarded as belonging to the family Rhagionidae, possibly in a subfamily Vermileoninae. Their biology and morphology are so markedly distinct from the main Rhagionidae sensu stricto however, that the placement as a separate family has been widely accepted.\n\nAdult\nThe adults are slender, fragile, long-legged flies, vaguely reminiscent of small crane flies. The adults generally visit flowers for nectar, but adults of some species may not feed at all. The mouthparts of the adult are hypognathous, used mainly for extracting nectar from flowers, long, and straight. This might have something to do with the common name \"snipe-fly\" for the family Rhagionidae, but it would be misleading to use that name for Vermileonidae now, as they are no longer included in the Rhagionidae, which still are called snipe-flies.\nMost vermileonid species are found in the drier regions of the western parts of Africa, from the Cape to Morocco, and also in the western parts of the Iberian Peninsula, mainly in Portugal.\n\nLarvae\nThe larvae of vermileonids are called wormlions which amounts to a direct translation of Vermileo. They have evolved the same elaborate mechanism for trapping prey, as one sees in many species of the Neuropteran family Myrmeleontidae, the so-called \"antlions\"; that is, they make cone-shaped pits in sandy areas and feed on insects that fall into the pits. The mechanism is elegant in that in both groups of insects, the larva creates the pit by flinging particles out. Much of the material falls back, coming to rest at effectively the critical angle of repose. This is a good example for convergent evolution.\nThus, when a small insect, commonly an ant, blunders into the pit, its weight causes the sand to collapse below it, drawing the victim toward the center, where the larva lies in wait under a thin layer of loose sand. As soon as it is alerted by falling sand grains, the larva assists this process by vigorously flicking more sand out from the center of the pit. This undermines the pit walls and causes them to collapse toward the center. The sand that the larva now is flinging also pelts the prey with so much loose, rolling material as to prevent it from getting any foothold on the easier slopes that the initial collapse of the slope has presented. The combined effect is to bring the prey down to within grasp of the larva, which then can inject venom and digestive fluids.\nUnlike the pit-digging Myrmeleontidae, vermileonid larvae do not travel round and round while digging the pit trap. Instead, they simply lie at the center with the rear end buried, and dig their heads repeatedly forward into the sand, flinging it out by vigorously straightening their fore ends. In contrast with conical digging, this approach is believed to take longer since more sand is likely to fall back into the pit when throwing from the center. Finally, they cover themselves with a thin layer of sand while lying across the bottom of the cone. Wormlion larvae prefer shaded habitats over lit ones, fine sand of small particle size over coarser sand, and obstacle free soil. All these factors enable them to construct large pits. Unfavorable conditions lead to more frequent relocation of the pits.\nThe main enemies of the larvae of either antlions or wormlions are ground-hunting birds such as hoopoes and gallinaceous birds that learn to recognise their pits and probe or scratch them from the sand. If alarmed by such activity, the wormlion larva retracts abruptly into an S-shape under the sand, and if dug out, it retains that shape, not having much option for an alternative strategy at its disposal. Actually, because its skin is coated with sand, and it is very small, it is very easy to overlook while it lies still. However, if it is sufficiently teased after being dug out, it may begin to lash about powerfully, flinging itself away with enough force to escape its tormentor. It does not, however, hook its mouthparts into its hinder end to achieve an efficient leap such as some fruit fly and carrion fly larvae do.\nThe 10th and 11th segment of the larva each bears a transverse row of long hooklets that it uses in anchoring itself and in shifting sand. The fifth segment has a ventral pseudopod that helps to hold prey.  Not having sickle jaws like an antlion, the larva grasps prey by lashing forward and catching the victim by bending the head down to catch it between its two fang-like jaws and its pseudopod.\nLike antlion larvae, vermileonid larvae are primarily found in sandy habitats, often semi-deserts, usually in the shelter of rocks or bushes, and they are voracious predators.\n\nClassification\nThe infraorder Vermileonomorpha is often included within the Tabanomorpha, though the most recent classifications place them as its sister taxon.\n\nSpecies lists\nPalaearctic (Broken link)\n\nReferences\nNagatomi, A. 1997.

        "content": "Ran (Japanese: 乱, lit. 'chaos or tumult') is a 1985 epic historical action drama film directed, co-written, and edited by Akira Kurosawa. The plot derives from William Shakespeare's King Lear and includes segments based on legends of the daimyō Mōri Motonari. The film stars Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora Ichimonji, an aging Sengoku-period warlord who decides to abdicate as ruler in favor of his three sons.\nLike most of Kurosawa's work in the 1970s and 80s, Ran is an international production, in this case a Japanese-French venture produced by Herald Ace, Nippon Herald Films, and Greenwich Film Productions. Production planning went through a long period of preparation. Kurosawa conceived the idea of Ran in the mid-1970s, when he read about Motonari, who was famous for having three highly loyal sons. Kurosawa devised a plot in which the sons become antagonists of their father. Although the film became heavily inspired by Shakespeare's play King Lear, Kurosawa began using it only after he had started preparations for Ran. Following these preparations, Kurosawa filmed Dersu Uzala in 1975, followed by Kagemusha in the early 1980s, before securing financial backing to film Ran.\nRan was Kurosawa's third encounter with Shakespeare during his career. In 1957, Kurosawa directed Throne of Blood, based on Shakespeare's Macbeth. In 1960, he directed the film The Bad Sleep Well, based on Hamlet. Despite the changes in setting and language, all three films have received critical acclaim.\nAs Kurosawa's last epic, Ran has often been cited as among his finest achievements and is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. With a budget of $11–12 million, it was the most expensive film in the history of Japanese cinema upon its release. Ran was previewed on  May 31, 1985, at the Tokyo International Film Festival before its release on June 1, 1985, in Japan. The film was hailed for its powerful images and use of color;  costume designer Emi Wada won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design for her work on Ran, and Kurosawa received his only career nomination for Best Director. The distinctive film score, inspired by Gustav Mahler, was composed by Toru Takemitsu.\n\nPlot\nHidetora Ichimonji, a powerful but elderly warlord, decides to divide his kingdom among his three sons: Taro, Jiro, and Saburo. Taro, the eldest, will receive the prestigious First Castle and become leader of the Ichimonji clan, while Jiro and Saburo will be given the Second and Third Castles. Hidetora is to retain the title of Great Lord and Jiro and Saburo are to support Taro. However, Saburo is exiled after criticizing his father's lecture about unity. Hidetora's servant Tango is also exiled for defending Saburo.\nFollowing the division of Hidetora's lands between his remaining two sons, Taro's wife, Lady Kaede, still bitter about Hidetora killing her family and taking their land, successfully urges him to usurp control of the entire Ichimonji clan. When Taro demands Hidetora renounce his title, Hidetora leaves and travels to Jiro's castle, only to discover that Jiro is only interested in using Hidetora as a titular pawn. As Hidetora and his retinue wander, Tango warns Hidetora of Taro's new decree: death to whoever aids his father. Hidetora plans to take refuge in the Third Castle, which was abandoned by Saburo's forces (who followed him into exile) and taken over by Taro's general Ogura. Hidetora feels they can take Ogura easily, whereas Kyoami, the court fool, jokes about Hidetora's predicament, and is yelled at by Hidetora to stay behind if he's afraid. Kyoami and Tango stay outside while Hidetora and the rest of his retinue take refuge in the Third Castle, which they find unoccupied.\nLater, Hidetora and his retinue are attacked by Taro and Jiro's combined forces - Taro's men had \"abandoned\" the castle to lure Hidetora into a false sense of security and ambush him. Taro is killed by a bullet fired by Jiro's general, Kurogane. All of Hidetora's retinue are either killed or commit ritual suicide. Hidetora is allowed to survive and succumbs to madness as he wanders away from the destroyed castle. Kyoami and Tango, still loyal to Hidetora, find him and stay to assist. Hidetora is haunted by visions of the people he killed in the past. They take refuge in a peasant's home only to discover that the occupant is Tsurumaru, the brother of Lady Sue, Jiro's wife. Tsurumaru's eyes were gouged out by Hidetora's forces and he was left impoverished due to Hidetora's siege. With Taro dead, Jiro becomes the Great Lord of the Ichimonji clan, and moves into the First Castle. Lady Kaede manipulates Jiro into having an affair with her, and demands that he kill Lady Sue, and marry her instead. Jiro orders Kurogane to do the deed, but he refuses, seeing through Kaede's perfidy. Kurogane then warns Sue and Tsurumaru to flee. Tango encounters former spies and before killing them, he is informed that Jiro is considering sending assassins after Hidetora. Tango rides off to alert Saburo. As his madness grows, Hidetora runs off into a volcanic plain.\nAfter Saburo's army enters Jiro's territory to find Hidetora, Jiro hastily mobilizes his army. After a truce, Saburo learns from Kyoami of Hidetora's potential location. After Saburo leaves, Jiro attacks Saburo's smaller forces, suffering losses, and orders his remaining forces to retreat after learning of another army marching on the First Castle. Saburo finds Hidetora, who partially recovers his sanity, and reconciles with Saburo. However, Saburo is killed by one of Jiro's snipers. Hidetora dies from grief. Tsurumaru and Sue arrive at the ruins of a castle, but inadvertently leave behind the flute that Sue gave him when he was banished. She gives him a picture of Amida Buddha for protection while she attempts to retrieve the flute. However, she never returns.\nAs the First Castle is besieged, Kurogane learns of Sue's death, and confronts Kaede. After she confesses her plot was revenge against the Ichimonji clan, she is killed by Kurogane. Jiro, Kurogane, and all Jiro's men subsequently die in battle. A funeral procession is held for Saburo and Hidetora. Meanwhile, left alone in the castle ruins, Tsurumaru trips, dropping the Amida Buddha image Sue had given to him. The film ends with a distant shot of Tsurumaru silhouetted against the castle's landscape atop the ruins.\n\nCast\nProduction\nRan was Kurosawa's last epic film and by far his most expensive. At the time, its budget of $11–12 million made it the most expensive Japanese film in history, leading to its distribution in 1985 exceeding the budget of $7.5 million for his previous film Kagemusha. It is a Japanese-French venture produced by Herald Ace, Nippon Herald Films, and Greenwich Film Productions. Filming started in 1983. The 1,400 uniforms and suits of armor used for the extras were designed by costume designer Emi Wada and Kurosawa, and were handmade by master tailors over more than two years. The film also used 200 horses. Kurosawa loved filming in lush and expansive locations, and most of Ran was shot amidst the mountains and plains of Mount Aso, Japan's largest active volcano. Kurosawa was granted permission to shoot at two of the country's most famous landmarks, the ancient castles at Kumamoto and Himeji. For the castle of Lady Sue's family, he used the ruins of the custom-constructed Azusa castle, made by Kurosawa's production crew near Mount Fuji. Hidetora's third castle, which was burned to the ground, was a real building which Kurosawa built on the slopes of Mount Fuji. No miniatures were used for that segment, and Tatsuya Nakadai had to do the scene where Hidetora flees the castle in one take.  Kurosawa also filmed a scene that required an entire field to be sprayed gold, but cut it out of the final film during editing. The documentary A.K. shows the filming of the scene.\nKurosawa often shot scenes with three cameras simultaneously, each using different lenses and angles. Many long-shots were employed and very few close-ups. On several occasions, Kurosawa used static cameras and suddenly brought the action into frame, rather than using the camera to track the action. He also used jump cuts to progress certain scenes, changing the pace of the action for filmic effect.\nAkira Kurosawa's wife of 39 years, Yōko Yaguchi, died during the production of the film. He halted filming for one day to mourn before resuming work. His regular recording engineer Fumio Yanoguchi also died late in production in January 1985.\n\nCrew\nPersonnel taken from The Criterion Collection.\n\nDevelopment\nKurosawa conceived of the idea that became Ran in the mid-1970s, when he read a parable about the Sengoku-period warlord Mōri Motonari. Motonari was famous for having three sons, all incredibly loyal and talented. Kurosawa began imagining what would have happened had they been bad. Although the film eventually became heavily inspired by Shakespeare's play King Lear, Kurosawa became aware of the play only after he had started pre-planning. According to him, the stories of Mōri Motonari and Lear merged in a way he was never fully able to explain. He wrote the script shortly after filming Dersu Uzala in 1975, and then \"let it sleep\" for seven years. During this time, he painted storyboards of every shot in the film (later included with the screenplay and available on the Criterion Collection DVD release) and then continued searching for funding. Following his success with 1980's Kagemusha, which he later considered a \"dress rehearsal\" or \"dry run\" for Ran, Kurosawa was finally able to secure backing from French producer Serge Silberman.\nKurosawa once said \"Hidetora is me\", and there is evidence in the film that Hidetora serves as a stand-in for Kurosawa. Roger Ebert agrees, arguing that Ran \"may be as much about Kurosawa's life as Shakespeare's play\". Ran was the final film of Kurosawa's \"third period\" (1965–1985), a time where he had difficulty securing support for his pictures, and was frequently forced to seek foreign financial backing. While he had directed over twenty films in the first two decades of his career, he directed just four in these two decades. After directing Red Beard (1965), Kurosawa discovered that he was considered old-fashioned and did not work again for almost five years. He also found himself competing against television, which had reduced Japanese film audiences from a high of 1.1 billion in 1958 to under 200 million by 1975. In 1968, he was fired from the 20th Century Fox epic Tora! Tora! Tora! over what he described as creative differences, but others said was a perfectionism that bordered on insanity. Kurosawa tried to start an independent production group with three other directors, but his 1970 film Dodes'ka-den was a box-office flop and bankrupted the company.  Many of his younger rivals boasted that he was finished. A year later, unable to secure any domestic funding and plagued by ill health, Kurosawa attempted suicide by slashing his wrists. Though he survived, his misfortune continued to plague him until the late 1980s. According to Stephen Prince, medical treatment and Mosfilm's offer to make a film in Russia (Dersu Uzala) helped Kurosawa's eventual \"spiritual recovery.\" \nKurosawa was influenced by the William Shakespeare play King Lear and borrowed elements from it. Both depict an aging warlord who decides to divide up his kingdom among his children. Hidetora has three sons – Taro, Jiro, and Saburo – who correspond to Lear's daughters Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia. In both, the warlord foolishly banishes anyone who disagrees with him as a matter of pride – in Lear it is the Earl of Kent and Cordelia; in Ran it is Tango and Saburo. The conflict in both is that two of the lord's children ultimately turn against him, while the third supports him, though Hidetora's sons are far more ruthless than Goneril and Regan. Both King Lear and Ran end with the death of the entire family, including the lord.\nThere are some crucial differences between the two stories. King Lear is a play about undeserved suffering, and Lear himself is at worst a fool. Hidetora, by contrast, has been a cruel warrior for most of his life: a man who ruthlessly murdered men, women, and children to achieve his goals.  In Ran, Lady Kaede, Lady Sue, and Tsurumaru were all victims of Hidetora. Whereas in King Lear the character of Gloucester had his eyes gouged out by Lear's enemies, in Ran it was Hidetora himself who gave the order to blind Tsurumaru. The role of the Fool has been expanded into a major character (Kyoami). Kurosawa was concerned that Shakespeare gave his characters no past, and he wanted to give his version of King Lear a history.\nThe complex and variant etymology for the word Ran used as the title has been variously translated as \"chaos\", \"rebellion\", or \"revolt\"; or to mean \"disturbed\" or \"confused\".\n\nFilming\nThe filming of Ran began in 1983. The development and conception of the filming of the war scenes in the film were influenced by Kurosawa's opinions on nuclear warfare. According to Michael Wilmington, Kurosawa told him that much of the film was a metaphor for nuclear warfare and the anxiety of the post-Hiroshima age. He believed that, despite all of the technological progress of the 20th century, all people had learned was how to kill each other more efficiently.  In Ran, the vehicle for apocalyptic destruction is the arquebus, an early firearm that was introduced to Japan in the 16th century. Arquebuses revolutionized samurai warfare. Kurosawa had already dealt with this theme in his previous film Kagemusha, in which the Takeda cavalry is destroyed by the arquebuses of the Oda and Tokugawa clans.\nIn Ran, the battle of Hachiman Field is an illustration of this new kind of warfare. Saburo's arquebusiers annihilate Jiro's cavalry and drive off his infantry by engaging them from the woods, where the cavalry are unable to venture. Similarly, Taro and Saburo's assassination by a sniper also shows how individual heroes can be easily disposed of on a modern battlefield. Kurosawa also illustrates this new warfare with his camera. Instead of focusing on the warring armies, he frequently sets the focal plane beyond the action, so that in the film they appear as abstract entities.\n\nCasting\nThe description of Hidetora in the first script was originally based on Toshiro Mifune. However, the role was cast to Tatsuya Nakadai, an actor who had played several supporting and major characters in previous Kurosawa films, such as Shingen and his double in Kagemusha. Other Kurosawa veterans in Ran were Masayuki Yui (Tango), Jinpachi Nezu (Jiro) and Daisuke Ryu (Saburo), all of whom were in Kagemusha. For Akira Terao (Taro) and Mieko Harada (Lady Kaede), Ran was their first Kurosawa film, but they would go on to work with him again in Dreams. Hisashi Igawa (Kurogane), who had previously been in Kurosawa's Dodes'ka-den, would reappear in both Dreams and Rhapsody in August. Kurosawa also hired two popular entertainers for supporting roles: singer-dancer Shinnosuke \"Peter\" Ikehata as Hidetora's loyal fool Kyoami and comedian-musician Hitoshi Ueki as rival warlord Nobuhiro Fujimaki. About 1,400 extras were employed.\n\nActing style\nWhile most of the characters in Ran are portrayed by conventional acting techniques, two performances are reminiscent of Japanese Noh theatre. Noh is a form of Japanese traditional theatre requiring highly-trained actors and musicians where emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures. The heavy, ghost-like make-up worn by Tatsuya Nakadai's character, Hidetora, resembles the emotive masks worn by traditional Noh performers. The body language exhibited by the same character is also typical of Noh theatre: long periods of static motion and silence, followed by an abrupt, sometimes violent, change in stance. The character of Lady Kaede is also Noh-influenced. The Noh treatment emphasizes the ruthless, passionate, and single-minded natures of these two characters.\n\nMusic\nCraig Lysy, writing for Movie Music UK, commented on the strengths of the film soundtrack's composer for Kurosawa's purposes: \"Tōru Takemitsu was Japan's preeminent film score composer and Kurosawa secured his involvement in 1976, during the project's early stages. Their initial conception of the score was to use tategoe, a \"shrill-voice\" chant style without instrumentation. Over the intervening years, Kurosawa's conception of the score changed dramatically. As they began production his desire had changed 180 degrees, now insisting on a powerful Mahleresque orchestral score. Takemitsu responded with what many describe as his most romantic effort, one that achieved a perfect blending of Oriental and Occidental sensibilities.\"\nTakemitsu has stated that he was significantly influenced by the Japanese karmic concept of ma, interpreted as a surplus of energy surrounding an abundant void. As Lysy stated: \"Takemitsu was guided in his efforts best summed up in the Japanese word ma, which suggests the incongruity of a void abounding with energy. He related: 'My music is like a garden, and I am the gardener. Listening to my music can be compared with walking through a garden and experiencing the changes in light, pattern and texture.'\"\nThe project was the second of two which allowed Kurosawa and Takemitsu to collaborate, the first being Dodes'ka-den in 1970. Lysy summarized the second project stating: \"the collaboration between Kurosawa and the temperamental Takemitsu was rocky. Kurosawa constantly sent Takemitsu notes, which only served to infuriate him, so he frequently visited the set to gain a direct sensual experience. Takemitsu actually resigned... Fortunately, producer Masato Hara intervened, made peace, and Takemitsu returned to the film. Years later, Takemitsu would relate: \"Overall, I still have this feeling of ... 'Oh, if only he'd left more up to me' ... But seeing it now ... I guess it's fine the way it is.'\"\nKurosawa originally had wanted the London Symphony Orchestra to perform the score for Ran, but upon meeting conductor Hiroyuki Iwaki of the Sapporo Symphony Orchestra, he engaged Iwaki and the orchestra to record it. Kurosawa had the orchestra play up to 40 takes of the music. The running time of the soundtrack is just over an hour and was re-released in 2016 after its original release in 1985 by Silva Screen Productions. It was produced by Reynold da Silva and David Stoner.\n\nReception\nBox office\nReleased on June 1, 1985, it was modestly successful financially in Japan. It earned ¥2.51 billion ($12 million) in Japan, just enough to break even. In France, where it released on 18 September 1985, the film sold 813,081 tickets, grossing an estimated 24,392,430 F ($2,439,243).\nIn the United States, where it released in December 1985, the film grossed $3,763,760 in its first four weeks of release. Later re-releases between 2000 and 2016 grossed $528,357 in the United States and Canada, bringing its total North American gross to $4,292,117.\nIn Germany, where it released in 1986, the film sold 222,862 tickets, grossing an estimated €735,440 ($714,912). The film also grossed $18,692 in the United Kingdom, and $16,215 in Portugal, bringing the film's total estimated gross to approximately $19,481,179 (equivalent to $55,000,000 in 2023) worldwide.\n\nCritical reviews\nRan was critically acclaimed upon its premiere. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 96%, based on 89 reviews, and an average rating of 9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Akira Kurosawa's sprawling, epic take on King Lear should be required viewing for fans of westerns, war movies, or period films in general.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 97 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nShawn Levy, of the Portland Oregonian wrote, \"In many respects, it's Kurosawa's most sumptuous film, a feast of color, motion and sound: Considering that its brethren include Kagemusha, Seven Samurai and Dersu Uzala, the achievement is extraordinary.\" Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert said, \"Ran is a great, glorious achievement.\" In the San Francisco Examiner, G. Allen Johnson stated: \"Kurosawa pulled out all the stops with Ran, his obsession with loyalty and his love of expressionistic film techniques allowed to roam freely.\"\nWriting for the San Francisco Chronicle, Bob Graham stated: \"In Ran, the horrors of life are transformed by art into beauty. It is finally so moving that the only appropriate response is silence.\" Gene Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune, wrote: \"The physical scale of Ran is overwhelming. It's almost as if Kurosawa is saying to all the cassette buyers of America, in a play on Clint Eastwood's phrase, 'Go ahead, ruin your night' – wait to see my film on a small screen and cheat yourself out of what a movie can be.\" Vincent Canby, writing for The New York Times, stated: \"Though big in physical scope and of a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism, Ran has the terrible logic and clarity of a morality tale seen in tight close-up, of a myth that, while being utterly specific and particular in its time and place, remains ageless, infinitely adaptable.\"\nRoger Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars, with extended commentary, \"Kurosawa (while directing Ran) often must have associated himself with the old lord as he tried to put this film together, but in the end he has triumphed, and the image I have of him, at 75, is of three arrows bundled together.\" In 2000, it was inducted into Ebert's Great Movies list.\nNotoriously acerbic critic John Simon of the National Review wrote, \"I find it as an almost total failure by a genius in his old age\".\nMichal Sragow, writing for Salon in 2000, summarized the Shakespearean origins of the play: \"Kurosawa's Lear is a 16th century warlord who has three sons and a career studded with conquests. Kurosawa's genius is to tell his story so that every step suggests how wild and savage a journey it has been. At the start, this bold, dominating figure, now called Hidetora, is a sacred monster who wants to be a sort of warlord emeritus. He hopes to bequeath power to his oldest son while retaining his own entourage and emblems of command. He hasn't reckoned with the ambition of his successor or the manipulative skill of his heir's wife, who goes for the sexual and political jugular of anyone who invades her sphere.\" In 2009, the film was voted at No. 59 on the list of The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo.\n\nAccolades\nRan was completed too late to be entered at Cannes and had its premiere at Japan's first Tokyo International Film Festival. Kurosawa skipped the film's premiere, angering many in the Japanese film industry. As a result, it was not submitted as Japan's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category of the Oscars. Serge Silberman tried to get it nominated as a French co-production but failed. However, American director Sidney Lumet helped organize a campaign to have Kurosawa nominated as Best Director.\nRan was nominated for the Academy Awards for art direction, cinematography, costume design (which it won), and Kurosawa's direction. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. In Japan, Ran was conspicuously not nominated for \"Best Picture\" at the Awards of the Japanese Academy. However, it won two prizes, for best art direction and best music score, and received four other nominations, for best cinematography, best lighting, best sound, and best supporting actor (Hitoshi Ueki, who played Saburo's patron, Lord Fujimaki). Ran won two awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, for best foreign language film and best make-up artist, and was nominated for best cinematography, best costume design, best production design, and best screenplay–adapted. Despite its limited commercial success at the time of its release, the film's accolades have improved greatly, and it is now regarded as one of Kurosawa's masterpieces.\nRan won Best Director and Best Foreign Film awards from the National Board of Review, a Best Film award and a Best Cinematography award (Takao Saitō, Shōji Ueda, and Asakazu Nakai) from the National Society of Film Critics, a Best Foreign Language Film award from the New York Film Critics Circle, a Best Music award (Toru Takemitsu) and a Best Foreign Film award from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, a Best Film award and a Best Cinematography award from the Boston Society of Film Critics, a Best Foreign Feature award from the Amanda Awards from Norway, a Blue Ribbon Award for Best Film, a Best European Film award from the Bodil Awards, a Best Foreign Director award from the David di Donatello Awards, a Joseph Plateau Award for Best Artistic Contribution, a Director of the Year award and a Foreign Language Film of the Year award from the London Critics Circle Film Awards, a Best Film, a Best Supporting Actor (Hisashi Igawa) and a Best Director from the Mainichi Film Concours, and an OCIC award from the San Sebastian Film Festival.\nIn the British Film Institute's 2002 Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films ever made, Ran ranked 41st in director's poll. In 2007, the film was ranked at No. 28 by The Guardian's readers' poll on its list of \"40 greatest foreign films of all time\". The film was selected in BBC's list of 100 greatest foreign language films by 209 critics of 43 countries around the world in 2018.\n\nSee also\nList of historical drama films of Asia\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nConrad, David A.

Raintheone (talk) 21:37, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nSo you have a crystal ball that you know they will be covered outside of their relationship to the show? Can you send me the winning lottery numbers too? -- The Red Pen of Doom 21:52, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nObviously the discussion has been closed with a speedy keep verdict, but for future reference, since Diversity won the competition, they appear to be notable under these guidelines for reality show contestants. Sky83 (talk) 22:07, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nDid you notice the big banner on the top of the page that indicates that those guidelines are not actually community consensus? -- The Red Pen of Doom 22:11, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nNo, I just decided to skip it....of course I saw it. But they are guidelines, and they are something to work from on the small chance this issue comes up in a serious way again. I get that you don't like this group or didn't want them to win etc, but I'm just trying to help out the debate here. For everyone else, a similar discussion took place over JLS in The X Factor last year, and that article was (as I remember) kept largely on the basis that they had placed in a reality music competition (or words to that effect). Sky83 (talk) 22:26, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nYour assumption that I gave a tinkers damn about the contest at all is no more relevant than your attempt at justifying to keep the article by citing guidelines that arent at all supported by consensus. -- The Red Pen of Doom 23:16, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nCareful, guys.  Down that road is incivility and \"preventative\" blocks.  Keep it civil, lest things get out of hand.  Cheers, guys.  lifebaka++ 23:18, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nYou're taking this a bit too personally. I never meant for it to be used as set in stone policy, I just thought that it would be a good starting point for discussion. All I stated was that they appeared to be notable under that, not that they were. Please don't take my points so personally, I didn't mean to offend you and I'm sorry for implying that you cared. Sky83 (talk) 23:25, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nI should point out that if they were musical artists, they actually would be automatically notable per WP:MUSIC. Let's bend those rules a bit to include any winners of BGT as automatically notable. We already do anyway. Sceptre (talk) 22:41, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nIt's possible that they qualify under that anyway. It really depends on what classification they fall into. It may be a slight grey area. Sky83 (talk) 22:52, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nDelete? Why? They won!\nIf you're gonna delete this, you may as well delete the entry for Susan Boyle. Diversity has much more right to have their own entry on Wikipedia since they have won what Susan Boyle was competing for. 22:40 GMT, May 30 2008  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.42.107.153 (talk) 21:41, 30 May 2009 (UTC) \n\nWrong: Even though I agree Diversity should have this page, Susan Boyle has more of a place mainly because the masses of references that have be turned up, she has appeared on shows such as Oprah, she is a proved internet phenomena. I could go on.. .Raintheone (talk) 21:44, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nActually I can't even believe someone would put up such an idea about deletion, I don't think it really worths discuss as this just cannot be deleted. The deletion policy isn't for essential articles like this, there are obviously loads of information to add to this article. Expansion should be concerned, but not deletion. Salmon (talk) 21:53, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nwe have REALLY REALLY REALLY different definitions of \"essential\". -- The Red Pen of Doom 22:06, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nYeah, there really is no point to all of this is there. I'm sure those who are trying know with in one day there will be to much notabality to justify thinking about deleting this article.Raintheone (talk) 22:04, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nI agree.

Not much logic.Liquinn (talk) 22:05, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nReferences\nI keep trying to add references to reliable sources such as Sky News, BBC News, Daily Mail etc. and they keep being removed in favour of Unreality TV links. Please can you add reliable sources to the article. 03md 22:05, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nI would of thought that's good enough, I mean, reliable sources... Liquinn (talk) 22:08, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nCan you post the links here if they're not staying on the page?  The ones currently on the page hardly look authoritative, and I'm sure there are replacements.  Cycle~ (talk) 22:10, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nUnfortunately, the reference after names of the members is wrong because Ike Ezekwugo is missing there.

You can count them + they clearly said on their interview after the final that there are eleven of them! + there are more links with this: e.g. http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/4387162.Talented_dance_group_visits_sick_children/Sandrestina (talk) 23:25, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nCurrent template\nIs the {{current}} template relevant?  I'd say it's more appropriate to the Britain's Got Talent article (or relevant series article).  Just because the group won a recent competition doesn't mean the template is relevant – the guidelines state that the template \"...is not intended to be used to mark an article that merely has recent news articles about the topic\".  I'm not denying the fact they are currently \"in the news\", but I feel the template is better placed on the parent article.  Anyway – the reason I've brought this here is that I removed it once and this was reverted – perhaps accidentally – but I wanted other opinions.  Cycle~ (talk) 22:06, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nI think the current template is relevant - just look at how many edits to the article have occured in the past few hours because of the results of the show, look how many potential new sources are arriving every hour, etc. -- The Red Pen of Doom 22:09, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nI just don't see how the \"current\" template adds anything to the article.  Yes, the band group may be getting lots of press at the moment (or, at least, soon), but there's not a lot of new information coming in about them.  Cycle~ (talk) 22:12, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nIts relevant because it lets readers know immediately that the version that they happen to see now when they tune in should be taken as a version that is subject to frequent and perhaps drastic changes as time allows sources and wikipedia editors to put the subject of the article and its content into real perspective. -- The Red Pen of Doom 23:40, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nEleventh Member?\nThis article (and many other places) state that the group has ten members but there are clearly eleven members on stage when the results are announced in the Britains got talent final, plus in their original audition eleven people introduce themselves. I can't quite hear the name of the person who is missing, but it may be Ike?\n\nThis video shows the group introducing themselves – it definitely sounds like \"Ike\" (to me).  Cycle~ (talk) 22:37, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nI have added \"Ike\" to the list – perhaps we can find a surname from somewhere?  I don't know the source of the other surnames.  Cycle~ (talk) 22:48, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nI think it is \"Mike\". In the video of the first audition, after all three set of brothers introduced themselves, it was first Perri, Warren then the missing eleventh one and then Terry. \nAfter the final show, on \"Britain's got more Talent\" Diversity clearly said there are 11 of them.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Sandrestina (talk • contribs) 22:50, 30 May 2009 (UTC) \n\nHmm.  There's definitely 11 – but I'm stumped working out that guy's name.  Cycle~ (talk) 22:53, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nScrap that.  ITV has him listed as Ike: \"Ashley, Jordan, Sam, Mitchell, Ian, Jamie, Matt, Perry, Warren, Ike and Terry\".  Cycle~ (talk) 22:53, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nhttp://essexroundup.wordpress.com/2009/05/30/diversity-win-britains-got-talent-bgt/ I found it and linked it  Sandrestina (talk) 23:05, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nI've removed that link; WP:RS (reliable sources) states that blogs and similar sources should not be used as points of reference (especially when an authoritative source can replace the reference).  Cycle~ (talk) 23:21, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nyou are right. I put more official reference. Sandrestina (talk) 23:29, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nTen members\nThe latest BBC article states the group has 10 members.  I'm sure I saw another news page which left out Ike – perhaps he left since the original audition?  Cycle~ (talk) 23:21, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nthis info is wrong for sure e.g. http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/4387162.Talented_dance_group_visits_sick_children/ Sandrestina (talk) 23:29, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nCould be a possibility I suppose. Liquinn (talk) 23:26, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nEven in the official text about Diversity on ITV url: http://talent.itv.com/finalists/finalist-detail/item_400004.htm\nis written in the beginning 10 members and then, at the end of the text, 11 members \"All the group are from the East London / Essex area. There are 11 members with 3 sets of brothers and 3 other members. \". Clear mistake and many further resources copy&pasted the wrong info Sandrestina (talk) 23:44, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nI suggest we leave it as-is for the moment.  Presumably it's Ike who is the dubious member – until there's a definite source stating he's not in the group (or that there are definitely only 10 members), we should keep it as 11.  Cycle~ (talk) 23:47, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nJust as a further FYI, the article linked above by Cycle now shows as eleven members. I think thats fairly good confirmation that there are in fact eleven members and the ten members description is probably just a mistake furthered by lazy journalism.\n\nI'm happy with it staying as it is (11) – but there are photos of the group (see infobox) with 10 members.  Cycle~ (talk) 17:22, 31 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nAges\nI'm a bit concerned about the ages being listed with the member names.  Some of these guys are pretty young, and it doesn't add any tangible benefit to the article.  I'd prefer to see them removed, and that section turned to prose instead of a bulleted list (though this is of secondary concern).  Cheers, everyone.  lifebaka++ 22:37, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nDo we have any consensus on this from elsewhere?  I agree in as much as their ages add anything to the article – do we need them?  Cycle~ (talk) 22:43, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nIt's usually avoided unless we need them, as it's always better to err on the side of caution when dealing with living people.  Cheers.  lifebaka++ 22:50, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nI think it would be enough to just state that there are mixed ages or even just to say that the group is made up of adults and children, or something along those lines. Sky83 (talk) 22:53, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nYeah, sounds good to me.  I'll go make the change presently.  Cheers.  lifebaka++ 22:55, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\n(Edit conflict) This is a valid concern, but on reflection I think it is okay, perhaps they chose their name based on age and race differences? If this is the case, their differences in age is of interest. I do not see a big problem here. The other kids on the show gave their ages. But, I am open to discussion, as always. Graham Colm Talk 23:00, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nPerhaps we could just give the range of their ages? Graham, Graham Colm Talk 23:03, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nAn age range or other compromise I'm fine with, but listing the ages next to each not so much.  It's better to put as little private information as possible.  My prose needs work, too.  Cheers.  lifebaka++ 23:06, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nYeah, that's a good idea. What good would it do to have the ages in the article? I think the ages of the members of the group doesn't matter... I guesss.Liquinn (talk) 23:04, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nThis BBC News article states that the ages are between 12 and 25, which is a fairly decent way of showing how chronologically diverse they are. I don't think it's going to be a major issue if people want the ages in, but to avoid a dispute, the BBC wording might be a decent way to go. Sky83 (talk) 23:07, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nI agree with Sky83, currently \"adults and children\" sounds somehow weird Sandrestina (talk) 23:13, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\n(outdent) Yeah, sorry about that.  I'll go fix it with the range, so it reads better.  Cheers.  lifebaka++ 23:15, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nThat's good. Graham Colm Talk 23:18, 30 May 2009 (UTC)\nThis link: [redacted]  has the names, ages, and HOMETOWN of each of the 11 members listed on the photo.  LeahBethM (talk) 05:02, 2 June 2009 (UTC)\nJust because other agencies have more leinient policies regarding privicy of minors than we do doesnt mean that we should be making that information more widely available. -- The Red Pen of Doom 06:33, 2 June 2009 (UTC)\n\n1 in 20 votes??\nThis quote at the end of the passage is more than likely incorrect, as it would mean that the other 9 acts would have to have scored less than 1 in 20 votes as well... if they scored 0.99 per 20 votes, per act, the total of all 10 acts would be less than 9.99 votes per 20 votes.

Cycle~ (talk) 19:29, 31 May 2009 (UTC)\nIt was last night, but that's all I can remember. I don't think it was in the first show, so that would make it during the results or on the More Talent show.

I can see that Nathan Ramsay has been added and I agree he has been working with Diversity alot over the last year or so but he is not listed as a member on their web site. If we are going to include Nathan due to working with the group over the last year or so then there are 3 members of Diversity Juniors who should probably also be included but I am having a problem confirming their names. I am leaving Nathan in for now but I think it worth a discussion and more investigation. WyrmVane (talk) 19:23, 26 November 2016 (UTC)\n\nThe Credits on last night Diversity presnts steel the show has Nathan listed as the 8th member of Diversity intrestingly Ike was not listed at all. So it looks like they got a situation where Ike is listed as member on group website but appears to have been removed as of last night from the group images on their facebook. Nathan on the other hand is in some of the recently updated photes but not listed on the website. I am beginning to supect that they are over due an update of their website again which I don't think is a first time but I can't prove it as they don't appear to post about line up changes. For now I am happy that Nathan is a member but I am not at all sure about Ike. I will update Ike's surname as he has clearly changed it sometime ago. If anyone has any sources that confirm one way another if there has been a line up change it would be good to know.

It was designed by the United States National Security Agency, and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard. The algorithm has been cryptographically broken but is still widely used.\nSince 2005, SHA-1 has not been considered secure against well-funded opponents; as of 2010 many organizations have recommended its replacement. NIST formally deprecated use of SHA-1 in 2011 and disallowed its use for digital signatures in 2013, and declared that it should be phased out by 2030. As of 2020, chosen-prefix attacks against SHA-1 are practical. As such, it is recommended to remove SHA-1 from products as soon as possible and instead use SHA-2 or SHA-3. Replacing SHA-1 is urgent where it is used for digital signatures.\nAll major web browser vendors ceased acceptance of SHA-1 SSL certificates in 2017. In February 2017, CWI Amsterdam and Google announced they had performed a collision attack against SHA-1, publishing two dissimilar PDF files which produced the same SHA-1 hash. However, SHA-1 is still secure for HMAC.\nMicrosoft has discontinued SHA-1 code signing support for Windows Update on August 3, 2020, which also effectively ended the update servers for versions of Windows that have not been updated to SHA-2, such as Windows 2000 up to Vista, as well as Windows Server versions from Windows 2000 Server to Server 2003.\n\nDevelopment\nSHA-1 produces a message digest based on principles similar to those used by Ronald L. Rivest of MIT in the design of the MD2, MD4 and MD5 message digest algorithms, but generates a larger hash value (160 bits vs. 128 bits).\nSHA-1 was developed as part of the U.S. Government's Capstone project. The original specification of the algorithm was published in 1993 under the title Secure Hash Standard, FIPS PUB 180, by U.S. government standards agency NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). This version is now often named SHA-0. It was withdrawn by the NSA shortly after publication and was superseded by the revised version, published in 1995 in FIPS PUB 180-1 and commonly designated SHA-1. SHA-1 differs from SHA-0 only by a single bitwise rotation in the message schedule of its compression function. According to the NSA, this was done to correct a flaw in the original algorithm which reduced its cryptographic security, but they did not provide any further explanation. Publicly available techniques did indeed demonstrate a compromise of SHA-0, in 2004, before SHA-1 in 2017 (see §Attacks).\n\nApplications\nCryptography\nSHA-1 forms part of several widely used security applications and protocols, including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, S/MIME, and IPsec. Those applications can also use MD5; both MD5 and SHA-1 are descended from MD4.\nSHA-1 and SHA-2 are the hash algorithms required by law for use in certain U.S. government applications, including use within other cryptographic algorithms and protocols, for the protection of sensitive unclassified information. FIPS PUB 180-1 also encouraged adoption and use of SHA-1 by private and commercial organizations. SHA-1 is being retired from most government uses; the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology said, \"Federal agencies should stop using SHA-1 for...applications that require collision resistance as soon as practical, and must use the SHA-2 family of hash functions for these applications after 2010\", though that was later relaxed to allow SHA-1 to be used for verifying old digital signatures and time stamps.\nA prime motivation for the publication of the Secure Hash Algorithm was the Digital Signature Standard, in which it is incorporated.\nThe SHA hash functions have been used for the basis of the SHACAL block ciphers.\n\nData integrity\nRevision control systems such as Git, Mercurial, and Monotone use SHA-1, not for security, but to identify revisions and to ensure that the data has not changed due to accidental corruption. Linus Torvalds said about Git in 2007:\n\nIf you have disk corruption, if you have DRAM corruption, if you have any kind of problems at all, Git will notice them. It's not a question of if, it's a guarantee. You can have people who try to be malicious. They won't succeed. [...] Nobody has been able to break SHA-1, but the point is the SHA-1, as far as Git is concerned, isn't even a security feature. It's purely a consistency check. The security parts are elsewhere, so a lot of people assume that since Git uses SHA-1 and SHA-1 is used for cryptographically secure stuff, they think that, Okay, it's a huge security feature. It has nothing at all to do with security, it's just the best hash you can get. ...\nI guarantee you, if you put your data in Git, you can trust the fact that five years later, after it was converted from your hard disk to DVD to whatever new technology and you copied it along, five years later you can verify that the data you get back out is the exact same data you put in. [...]\nOne of the reasons I care is for the kernel, we had a break in on one of the BitKeeper sites where people tried to corrupt the kernel source code repositories.\nHowever Git does not require the second preimage resistance of SHA-1 as a security feature, since it will always prefer to keep the earliest version of an object in case of collision, preventing an attacker from surreptitiously overwriting files. The known attacks (as of 2020) also do not break second preimage resistance.\n\nCryptanalysis and validation\nFor a hash function for which L is the number of bits in the message digest, finding a message that corresponds to a given message digest can always be done using a brute force search in approximately 2L evaluations. This is called a preimage attack and may or may not be practical depending on L and the particular computing environment. However, a collision, consisting of finding two different messages that produce the same message digest, requires on average only about 1.2 × 2L/2 evaluations using a birthday attack. Thus the strength of a hash function is usually compared to a symmetric cipher of half the message digest length. SHA-1, which has a 160-bit message digest, was originally thought to have 80-bit strength.\nSome of the applications that use cryptographic hashes, like password storage, are only minimally affected by a collision attack. Constructing a password that works for a given account requires a preimage attack, as well as access to the hash of the original password, which may or may not be trivial. Reversing password encryption (e.g. to obtain a password to try against a user's account elsewhere) is not made possible by the attacks. However, even a secure password hash can't prevent brute-force attacks on weak passwords. See Password cracking.\nIn the case of document signing, an attacker could not simply fake a signature from an existing document: The attacker would have to produce a pair of documents, one innocuous and one damaging, and get the private key holder to sign the innocuous document. There are practical circumstances in which this is possible; until the end of 2008, it was possible to create forged SSL certificates using an MD5 collision.\nDue to the block and iterative structure of the algorithms and the absence of additional final steps, all SHA functions (except SHA-3) are vulnerable to length-extension and partial-message collision attacks. These attacks allow an attacker to forge a message signed only by a keyed hash –  SHA(key || message), but not SHA(message || key) – by extending the message and recalculating the hash without knowing the key. A simple improvement to prevent these attacks is to hash twice: SHAd(message) = SHA(SHA(0b || message)) (the length of 0b, zero block, is equal to the block size of the hash function).\n\nSHA-0\nAt CRYPTO 98, two French researchers, Florent Chabaud and Antoine Joux, presented an attack on SHA-0: collisions can be found with complexity 261, fewer than the 280 for an ideal hash function of the same size.\nIn 2004, Biham and Chen found near-collisions for SHA-0 – two messages that hash to nearly the same value; in this case, 142 out of the 160 bits are equal. They also found full collisions of SHA-0 reduced to 62 out of its 80 rounds.\nSubsequently, on 12 August 2004, a collision for the full SHA-0 algorithm was announced by Joux, Carribault, Lemuet, and Jalby. This was done by using a generalization of the Chabaud and Joux attack. Finding the collision had complexity 251 and took about 80,000 processor-hours on a supercomputer with 256 Itanium 2 processors (equivalent to 13 days of full-time use of the computer).\nOn 17 August 2004, at the Rump Session of CRYPTO 2004, preliminary results were announced by Wang, Feng, Lai, and Yu, about an attack on MD5, SHA-0 and other hash functions. The complexity of their attack on SHA-0 is 240, significantly better than the attack by Joux et al.\nIn February 2005, an attack by Xiaoyun Wang, Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu was announced which could find collisions in SHA-0 in 239 operations.\nAnother attack in 2008 applying the boomerang attack brought the complexity of finding collisions down to 233.6, which was estimated to take 1 hour on an average PC from the year 2008.\nIn light of the results for SHA-0, some experts suggested that plans for the use of SHA-1 in new cryptosystems should be reconsidered. After the CRYPTO 2004 results were published, NIST announced that they planned to phase out the use of SHA-1 by 2010 in favor of the SHA-2 variants.\n\nAttacks\nIn early 2005, Vincent Rijmen and Elisabeth Oswald published an attack on a reduced version of SHA-1 – 53 out of 80 rounds – which finds collisions with a computational effort of fewer than 280 operations.\nIn February 2005, an attack by Xiaoyun Wang, Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu was announced. The attacks can find collisions in the full version of SHA-1, requiring fewer than 269 operations. (A brute-force search would require 280 operations.)\nThe authors write: \"In particular, our analysis is built upon the original differential attack on SHA-0, the near collision attack on SHA-0, the multiblock collision techniques, as well as the message modification techniques used in the collision search attack on MD5. Breaking SHA-1 would not be possible without these powerful analytical techniques.\" The authors have presented a collision for 58-round SHA-1, found with 233 hash operations. The paper with the full attack description was published in August 2005 at the CRYPTO conference.\nIn an interview, Yin states that, \"Roughly, we exploit the following two weaknesses: One is that the file preprocessing step is not complicated enough; another is that certain math operations in the first 20 rounds have unexpected security problems.\"\nOn 17 August 2005, an improvement on the SHA-1 attack was announced on behalf of Xiaoyun Wang, Andrew Yao and Frances Yao at the CRYPTO 2005 Rump Session, lowering the complexity required for finding a collision in SHA-1 to 263. On 18 December 2007 the details of this result were explained and verified by Martin Cochran.\nChristophe De Cannière and Christian Rechberger further improved the attack on SHA-1 in \"Finding SHA-1 Characteristics: General Results and Applications,\" receiving the Best Paper Award at ASIACRYPT 2006. A two-block collision for 64-round SHA-1 was presented, found using unoptimized methods with 235 compression function evaluations. Since this attack requires the equivalent of about 235 evaluations, it is considered to be a significant theoretical break. Their attack was extended further to 73 rounds (of 80) in 2010 by Grechnikov. In order to find an actual collision in the full 80 rounds of the hash function, however, tremendous amounts of computer time are required. To that end, a collision search for SHA-1 using the volunteer computing platform BOINC began August 8, 2007, organized by the Graz University of Technology. The effort was abandoned May 12, 2009 due to lack of progress.\nAt the Rump Session of CRYPTO 2006, Christian Rechberger and Christophe De Cannière claimed to have discovered a collision attack on SHA-1 that would allow an attacker to select at least parts of the message.\nIn 2008, an attack methodology by Stéphane Manuel reported hash collisions with an estimated theoretical complexity of 251 to 257 operations. However he later retracted that claim after finding that local collision paths were not actually independent, and finally quoting for the most efficient a collision vector that was already known before this work.\nCameron McDonald, Philip Hawkes and Josef Pieprzyk presented a hash collision attack with claimed complexity 252 at the Rump Session of Eurocrypt 2009. However, the accompanying paper, \"Differential Path for SHA-1 with complexity O(252)\" has been withdrawn due to the authors' discovery that their estimate was incorrect.\nOne attack against SHA-1 was Marc Stevens with an estimated cost of $2.77M (2012) to break a single hash value by renting CPU power from cloud servers. Stevens developed this attack in a project called HashClash, implementing a differential path attack. On 8 November 2010, he claimed he had a fully working near-collision attack against full SHA-1 working with an estimated complexity equivalent to 257.5 SHA-1 compressions. He estimated this attack could be extended to a full collision with a complexity around 261.\n\nThe SHAppening\nOn 8 October 2015, Marc Stevens, Pierre Karpman, and Thomas Peyrin published a freestart collision attack on SHA-1's compression function that requires only 257 SHA-1 evaluations. This does not directly translate into a collision on the full SHA-1 hash function (where an attacker is not able to freely choose the initial internal state), but undermines the security claims for SHA-1. In particular, it was the first time that an attack on full SHA-1 had been demonstrated; all earlier attacks were too expensive for their authors to carry them out. The authors named this significant breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of SHA-1 The SHAppening.\nThe method was based on their earlier work, as well as the auxiliary paths (or boomerangs) speed-up technique from Joux and Peyrin, and using high performance/cost efficient GPU cards from Nvidia. The collision was found on a 16-node cluster with a total of 64 graphics cards. The authors estimated that a similar collision could be found by buying US$2,000 of GPU time on EC2.\nThe authors estimated that the cost of renting enough of EC2 CPU/GPU time to generate a full collision for SHA-1 at the time of publication was between US$75K and $120K, and noted that was well within the budget of criminal organizations, not to mention national intelligence agencies. As such, the authors recommended that SHA-1 be deprecated as quickly as possible.\n\nSHAttered – first public collision\nOn 23 February 2017, the CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) and Google announced the SHAttered attack, in which they generated two different PDF files with the same SHA-1 hash in roughly 263.1 SHA-1 evaluations. This attack is about 100,000 times faster than brute forcing a SHA-1 collision with a birthday attack, which was estimated to take 280 SHA-1 evaluations. The attack required \"the equivalent processing power of 6,500 years of single-CPU computations and 110 years of single-GPU computations\".\n\nBirthday-Near-Collision Attack – first practical chosen-prefix attack\nOn 24 April 2019 a paper by Gaëtan Leurent and Thomas Peyrin presented at Eurocrypt 2019 described an enhancement to the previously best chosen-prefix attack in Merkle–Damgård–like digest functions based on Davies–Meyer block ciphers. With these improvements, this method is capable of finding chosen-prefix collisions in approximately 268 SHA-1 evaluations. This is approximately 1 billion times faster (and now usable for many targeted attacks, thanks to the possibility of choosing a prefix, for example malicious code or faked identities in signed certificates) than the previous attack's 277.1 evaluations (but without chosen prefix, which was impractical for most targeted attacks because the found collisions were almost random) and is fast enough to be practical for resourceful attackers, requiring approximately $100,000 of cloud processing. This method is also capable of finding chosen-prefix collisions in the MD5 function, but at a complexity of 246.3 does not surpass the prior best available method at a theoretical level (239), though potentially at a practical level (≤249). This attack has a memory requirement of 500+ GB.\nOn 5 January 2020 the authors published an improved attack called \"shambles\". In this paper they demonstrate a chosen-prefix collision attack with a complexity of 263.4, that at the time of publication would cost US$45K per generated collision.\n\nOfficial validation\nImplementations of all FIPS-approved security functions can be officially validated through the CMVP program, jointly run by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE). For informal verification, a package to generate a high number of test vectors is made available for download on the NIST site; the resulting verification, however, does not replace the formal CMVP validation, which is required by law for certain applications.\nAs of December 2013, there are over 2000 validated implementations of SHA-1, with 14 of them capable of handling messages with a length in bits not a multiple of eight (see SHS Validation List Archived 2011-08-23 at the Wayback Machine).\n\nExamples and pseudocode\nExample hashes\nThese are examples of SHA-1 message digests in hexadecimal and in Base64 binary to ASCII text encoding.\n\nSHA1(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\")\nOutputted hexadecimal: 2fd4e1c67a2d28fced849ee1bb76e7391b93eb12\nOutputted Base64 binary to ASCII text encoding: L9ThxnotKPzthJ7hu3bnORuT6xI=\nEven a small change in the message will, with overwhelming probability, result in many bits changing due to the avalanche effect. For example, changing dog to cog produces a hash with different values for 81 of the 160 bits:\n\nSHA1(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy cog\")\nOutputted hexadecimal: de9f2c7fd25e1b3afad3e85a0bd17d9b100db4b3\nOutputted Base64 binary to ASCII text encoding: 3p8sf9JeGzr60+haC9F9mxANtLM=\nThe hash of the zero-length string is:\n\nSHA1(\"\")\nOutputted hexadecimal: da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709\nOutputted Base64 binary to ASCII text encoding: 2jmj7l5rSw0yVb/vlWAYkK/YBwk=\n\nSHA-1 pseudocode\nPseudocode for the SHA-1 algorithm follows:\n\nNote 1: All variables are unsigned 32-bit quantities and wrap modulo 232 when calculating, except for\n        ml, the message length, which is a 64-bit quantity, and\n        hh, the message digest, which is a 160-bit quantity.\nNote 2: All constants in this pseudo code are in big endian.\n        Within each word, the most significant byte is stored in the leftmost byte position\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nh0 = 0x67452301\nh1 = 0xEFCDAB89\nh2 = 0x98BADCFE\nh3 = 0x10325476\nh4 = 0xC3D2E1F0\n\nml = message length in bits (always a multiple of the number of bits in a character).\n\nPre-processing:\nappend the bit '1' to the message e.g. by adding 0x80 if message length is a multiple of 8 bits.\nappend 0 ≤ k < 512 bits '0', such that the resulting message length in bits\n   is congruent to −64 ≡ 448 (mod 512)\nappend ml, the original message length in bits, as a 64-bit big-endian integer. \n   Thus, the total length is a multiple of 512 bits.\n\nProcess the message in successive 512-bit chunks:\nbreak message into 512-bit chunks\nfor each chunk\n    break chunk into sixteen 32-bit big-endian words w[i], 0 ≤ i ≤ 15\n\n    Message schedule: extend the sixteen 32-bit words into eighty 32-bit words:\n    for i from 16 to 79\n        Note 3: SHA-0 differs by not having this leftrotate.\n        w[i] = (w[i-3] xor w[i-8] xor w[i-14] xor w[i-16]) leftrotate 1\n\n    Initialize hash value for this chunk:\n    a = h0\n    b = h1\n    c = h2\n    d = h3\n    e = h4\n\n    Main loop:\n    for i from 0 to 79\n        if 0 ≤ i ≤ 19 then\n            f = (b and c) or ((not b) and d)\n            k = 0x5A827999\n        else if 20 ≤ i ≤ 39\n            f = b xor c xor d\n            k = 0x6ED9EBA1\n        else if 40 ≤ i ≤ 59\n            f = (b and c) or (b and d) or (c and d) \n            k = 0x8F1BBCDC\n        else if 60 ≤ i ≤ 79\n            f = b xor c xor d\n            k = 0xCA62C1D6\n\n        temp = (a leftrotate 5) + f + e + k + w[i]\n        e = d\n        d = c\n        c = b leftrotate 30\n        b = a\n        a = temp\n\n    Add this chunk's hash to result so far:\n    h0 = h0 + a\n    h1 = h1 + b \n    h2 = h2 + c\n    h3 = h3 + d\n    h4 = h4 + e\n\nProduce the final hash value (big-endian) as a 160-bit number:\nhh = (h0 leftshift 128) or (h1 leftshift 96) or (h2 leftshift 64) or (h3 leftshift 32) or h4\n\nThe number hh is the message digest, which can be written in hexadecimal (base 16).\nThe chosen constant values used in the algorithm were assumed to be nothing up my sleeve numbers:\n\nThe four round constants k are 230 times the square roots of 2, 3, 5 and 10. However they were incorrectly rounded to the nearest integer instead of being rounded to the nearest odd integer, with equilibrated proportions of zero and one bits. As well, choosing the square root of 10 (which is not a prime) made it a common factor for the two other chosen square roots of primes 2 and 5, with possibly usable arithmetic properties across successive rounds, reducing the strength of the algorithm against finding collisions on some bits.\nThe first four starting values for h0 through h3 are the same with the MD5 algorithm, and the fifth (for h4) is similar. However they were not properly verified for being resistant against inversion of the few first rounds to infer possible collisions on some bits, usable by multiblock differential attacks.\nInstead of the formulation from the original FIPS PUB 180-1 shown, the following equivalent expressions may be used to compute f in the main loop above:\n\nBitwise choice between c and d, controlled by b.\n(0  ≤ i ≤ 19): f = d xor (b and (c xor d))                (alternative 1)\n(0  ≤ i ≤ 19): f = (b and c) or ((not b) and d)           (alternative 2)\n(0  ≤ i ≤ 19): f = (b and c) xor ((not b) and d)          (alternative 3)\n(0  ≤ i ≤ 19): f = vec_sel(d, c, b)                       (alternative 4)\n [premo08]\nBitwise majority function.\n(40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = (b and c) or (d and (b or c))          (alternative 1)\n(40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = (b and c) or (d and (b xor c))         (alternative 2)\n(40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = (b and c) xor (d and (b xor c))        (alternative 3)\n(40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = (b and c) xor (b and d) xor (c and d)  (alternative 4)\n(40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = vec_sel(c, b, c xor d)                 (alternative 5)\n\nIt was also shown that for the rounds 32–79 the computation of:\n\nw[i] = (w[i-3] xor w[i-8] xor w[i-14] xor w[i-16]) leftrotate 1\n\ncan be replaced with:\n\nw[i] = (w[i-6] xor w[i-16] xor w[i-28] xor w[i-32]) leftrotate 2\n\nThis transformation keeps all operands 64-bit aligned and, by removing the dependency of w[i] on w[i-3], allows efficient SIMD implementation with a vector length of 4 like x86 SSE instructions.\n\nComparison of SHA functions\nIn the table below, internal state means the \"internal hash sum\" after each compression of a data block.\n\nImplementations\nBelow is a list of cryptography libraries that support SHA-1:\n\nBotan\nBouncy Castle\ncryptlib\nCrypto++\nLibgcrypt\nMbed TLS\nNettle\nLibreSSL\nOpenSSL\nGnuTLS\nHardware acceleration is provided by the following processor extensions:\n\nIntel SHA extensions: Available on some Intel and AMD x86 processors.\nVIA PadLock\nIBM z/Architecture:  Available since 2003 as part of the Message-Security-Assist Extension\n\nCollision countermeasure\nIn the wake of SHAttered, Mark Stevens and Dan Shumow published \"sha1collisiondetection\" (SHA-1CD), a variant of SHA-1 that detects collision attacks and changes the hash output when one is detected.

        "content": "Budapest's Palotanegyed (Palace District) forms an inner part of Pest, the eastern half of Budapest. Known until the communist period as the ‘Magnates’ Quarter’, it consists of the most westerly part (west of the Nagykörút) of the city's Eighth District, or Józsefváros (Joseph Town), which was named on 7 November 1777 after Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria (1741-1790), who reigned 1765-1790 (1780-1790 as King of Hungary). (Vienna's Eighth District, the Josefstadt, was also named after him, but long after his reign, in 1850). Józsefváros developed immediately east of the medieval walls of Pest and was originally called Lerchenfeld ('Lark Field') or the Alsó-Külváros (‘Lower Suburb’). The Palotanegyed's borders are the Múzeum körút to the west, Rákóczi út to the north, the József körút to the east and Üllői út to the south. There is an extensive photo archive of the Palace District at the Fortepan website.\n\nPre-1945 history\nThe two-metre great flood of 1838 caused the collapse of 900 buildings in the Józsefváros, with only 250 surviving. The few buildings in the Palotanegyed which survive from before 1838 include the Szent Rókus-kápolna (Chapel of St Roch – the patron saint of plague sufferers), built in 1711 in the hope of warding off the plague then devastating Pest, on the site of an early Christian, possibly 4th century, chapel. The oldest known building in the Palace District, it was rebuilt in 1945 after being destroyed in World War II – and then was damaged badly again in 1956. The Szent Rókus Kórház (St Roch Hospital) next door – was opened in 1796, but in its current incarnation offers few clues to its antiquity.\nThe major impetus for the area's development after the great flood was the construction at its western end of the magnificent neo-classical Hungarian National Museum between 1837 and 1847, designed by the Viennese-born architect Mihály Pollack, after whom the square behind the museum is named. Meetings of the upper house of the Hungarian parliament, established as part of the compromise which founded the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, were held in the National Museum until the opening of the new Hungarian parliament building in 1904.\nThe rest of Hungary's original parliament was established next door to the museum at Főherceg Sándor utca 8 (Archduke Alexander Street), named in honour of Hungary's Habsburg Palatine, or Viceroy, during the years 1790–95, Archduke Alexander Leopold of Austria, in 1840. (In 1946 it was renamed Bródy Sándor utca – see below). The building, completed in 1866, was designed by one of 19th century Budapest's great architects, Miklós Ybl, who also designed the Opera House and the Basilica, as well as five of the Palotanegyed's palaces (Festetics, Pálffy, Károlyi (on Pollack Mihály tér), Bókay and Odescalchi/Degenfeld-Schomburg). Today the old parliament building houses the Italian Cultural Institute.\nUntil the outbreak of the First World War, these two buildings provided the impetus to members of the dual monarchy's aristocratic and mercantile elite – many of whom were members of parliament – building around 40 city palaces or mansions in the same area. The Károlyi family alone built four palaces in the district, Count János Zichy and his family three, while the Bánffy and Wenckheim families each built two. The district's palaces were mostly constructed in the streets surrounding the Museum (today's Bródy Sándor utca, Pollack Mihály tér, Múzeum utca, Reviczky utca, Ötpacsirta utca and Trefort utca.)\nA number were also built further east, including on today's Lőrinc pap tér, Gyulai Pál utca, Horánszky utca and Szentkirályi utca. The other residential buildings constructed in the Palace District around the same time were designed mainly for middle or upper-middle class occupants. The term 'palota' ('palace') is used more elastically in Hungary (and in much of Continental Europe) than in the English-speaking world. In the Palotanegyed it refers to everything from genuine palaces (such as the Wenckeim Palace, now Szabó Ervin Library) for aristocratic families, to buildings with generously proportioned apartments for the wealthy upper-middle classes (such as the Emich Palace on Horánszky utca).\nThe Palace District is also notable for one of Budapest's two surviving buildings designed by the famous Viennese architects Fellner & Helmer, the István Károlyi or Károlyi-Csekonics palace at Múzeum utca 17. (The other is the Vígszínház on the Szent István körút).\nOne of the great classical architects of Pest, József Hild, designed one of the earlier buildings in the district, the 1842 Virágfüzéres ház (‘Garland House’) at Baross utca 40. Long in an advanced state of dilapidation, in March 2021 its street exterior at least was in the process of being sympathetically restored.\nMost of the Palotanegyed's architecture echoes that of the Viennese Franz-Joseph era from the 1840s until World War One. However, there are also a number of buildings in the Hungarian Secession style, championed most famously by Ödön Lechner, notably the striking Gutenberg Otthon, designed by two of his most prominent disciples, the Nagyvárád-born brothers József and László Vágó and constructed in 1905-6 (there are restoration/renovation plans for the building) There are several other buildings in the Hungarian Secession style on Vas utca, Baross utca and Krúdy utca. Lechner's Jewish student Béla Lajta's designed the 1912 Count Széchenyi School of Trade on Vas utca, a striking contrast to most of the Palace District's architecture, fusing modernism, art deco and folk motifs. Its rich interior decoration, remarkably, survived World War II.\nA well-known Hungarian-Jewish architectural team also designed Hungary's first department store, the Corvin Áruház, on Blaha Lujza tér. The architect was Zoltán Reiss, who designed many buildings in Budapest and elsewhere in Hungary during the first decades of the twentieth century, and who also served as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian army in the First World War. Construction of the classicist building began in 1915, with the department store finally opening in 1926 (five years later it incorporated Hungary's first escalator). It was owned by M.J. Emden and Sons, Hamburg. The external sculptural reliefs were the work of the famous Hungarian-Jewish sculptor Ödön Beck, who vanished on 31 January 1945 during the Siege of Budapest.  \nOne of the lesser-known architects who designed buildings in the Palotanegyed's pre-World War One boom period was another Jewish architect, Adolf Greiner (born Losoncz, now Slovakia, 1847, died Budapest 1931). He designed the Újpest synagogue, built 1885–86, and a number of inner Pest apartment buildings in the 1890s, including the four-storey building at Horánszky utca 27, built in 1892.\nThe Palace District contains important educational and cultural institutions.  Between the Múzeum körút and Puskin utca is the Humanities Faculty of Budapest's Eötvös Loránd University, built 1880-3 by Imre Steindl, also the architect of the Parliament building. The central administration and many of the departments of the city's Semmelweis University (of medicine) occupy the block between Üllöi út, Baross utca, Mária utca and Szentkirályi utca.  They had appeared on maps by 1896 and are of a similar style to the nearby Eötvös Loránd University buildings. In addition, the Semmelweis University's Faculty of Health Sciences and the Hungarian Society of Therapists are housed in the former sanatorium and medicinal baths at Vas utca 17 (see photo). The Pázmány Péter Catholic University occupies two buildings on Szentkirályi utca, while the German-language Andrássy University is housed in the Festetics Palace. The Arts and Humanities Faculty of the Károli Gáspár University of the Reformed Church of Hungary is at Reviczky utca 4 and plans to expand ts presence in the Palotanegyed, into the former Károlyi palaces between Reviczky utca and Múzeum utca once their current redevelopment has been completed.\nSchools in the district include the Széchenyi School of Trade on Vas utca, the Eötvös Loránd University Trefort Ágoston teacher-practicing High School on Trefort utca, and three on Horánszky utca – the Benda Kálmán Arts and Social Sciences College (part of the Károli Gáspár University); the Vörösmarty Mihály Gimnázium the Saint Ignatius Jesuit College.\nThe main church in the district is the mainly neo-Romanesque Jézus Szíve templom (Church of the Sacred Heart), on Lőrinc pap tér, which was built 1880–1890 to the designs of József Kauser. Kauser also completed the spectacular interior of the Basilica after Miklós Ybl died in 1891 and designed the south-eastern quarter of the Kódály körönd, the magnificent quartet of residential palaces on Andrássy út between Oktogon and Heroes’ Square. The area around the Jézus Szíve templom has long been known as the ‘little Vatican’ for its numerous institutions connected with the Catholic Church. These include the Jézus Szíve Jezsuita lélkeszség (the Society of Jesus Convent) at Mária utca 25, the Kollégium Teréziánum of the Miasszonyunkról Nevezett Kalocsai Iskolanővérek Társulata (Terezianum College (student dormitory) of the Society of Our Lady Sisters of Kalocsa School at Mária utca 20 and several in Horánszky utca: the Saint Ignatius Jesuit College mentioned above (18); the Divine Saviour's Sisters Saint Anna College (Isteni Megváltóról Nevezett Nővérek Szent Anna Collégiuma)(17); the 1912 Párbeszédháza, the House of Dialogue, the Jesuits' spiritual and cultural centre in Budapest(20) (handed after the communist regime's dissolution of the Jesuit order to the Karl Marx University; ‘the ruined building was returned to the Jesuit order and the order had the building renovated by its hundredth anniversary’); and the Jézus Szíve társasága egyetemi szakkkolegiumá (during World War II the Jézus Szive Népleanyok Társasága (Sacred Heart Society of Folkgirls) was at this address) (14).\nThese institutions played a heroic role in helping persecuted Jews after the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944. The sisters of the Saint Anna College gave refuge to Jewish girls while the Sacred Heart Society of Folkgirls issued protective documents. The convent in Mária utca hid Jewish men, while the House of Dialogue, according to the plaque outside, ‘hid almost forty deserters and 120 Jews away in the basement and then helped them escape abroad.’\nThe 1877 Rabbinical Seminary and Budapest University of Jewish Studies on Gutenberg tér (Országos Rabbiképző – Zsidó Egyetem and Alapítvány a Zsidó Egyetemért) is the world's oldest institution where rabbis graduate. It also contains a synagogue. Its construction was financed by the Emperor and King Franz Joseph, and was originally named after him. (He visited it a month after its opening in November 1877). After the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944, the rabbinical institute was seized by the SS and turned into a prison. Adolf Eichmann used it as a base to organise the deportation of Hungarian Jews, mainly to Auschwitz.\nAccording to the Wikipedia article on the institute, an important part of its library was seized by the Nazis. ‘3000 books were dispatched to Prague, where Eichmann planned the construction of a \"Museum of an extinct race\" in the former Jewish quarter. Only in the 1980s were the books discovered in the cellar of the Jewish Museum of Prague and brought back to Budapest in 1989. ‘The library remains a source of pride for the university. It is considered one of the most important collections of Jewish theological literature outside Israel.’ During the communist period, the rabbinical seminary in Budapest, uniquely in Eastern Europe, continued to operate, attracting students from across the region, including the Soviet Union.\nIn addition to the main cultural institutions in the Palace District – the National Museum and the Szabó Ervin Library – the Uránia Cinema, at Rákóczy út 21, is also noteworthy. Designed by Henrik Schmahl in a hybrid Venetian Gothic-Moorish style, it opened in the mid-1890s initially as a cabaret theatre. Restored in 2002 to its original glory, four years later the Uránia was awarded the European Union's heritage protection prize, Europa Nostra, for outstanding restoration.\n\nSoviet occupation and Communism\nStill bullet-marked buildings show that the Palace District, like the rest of Budapest, was left scarred by the fighting at the end of the Second World War. The damage was particularly bad around the Nagykörút and Kálvin tér. But while buildings on the former were reconstructed more or less to their original state, on Kálvin tér many of the fine 19th century buildings on both sides of the square were demolished. More damage in both parts of the Palace District was inflicted during the 1956 uprising and the subsequent Soviet attack.\nThe communist regime neglected the district's buildings and committed some great acts of vandalism, especially the demolition in 1965 of the city's National Theatre, until 1908 the Népszínház (People's Theatre – or Volkstheater) on Blaha Lujza tér. This building, much loved by Budapesters, had been constructed in 1875 to the designs of Fellner & Helmer.  The loss of the National Theatre still seems to leave a gap on Blaha Lujza tér.  A street on the eastern side of the József körút which led to the Népszínház is still called Népszínház utca. In 1948 the regime also demolished the National Stables behind the Museum. In 1952, it used part of the area to construct a concrete bunker designed to enable the regime to continue broadcasting in case of emergency including nuclear attack.  The interior ministry also used it for conducting wiretaps. In 1969 this was incorporated into a larger Hungarian Radio office block equally unsympathetic to its grand surroundings.\nAs the post-war communist regime consolidated its grip, the names of a number of streets and institutions in the Palotanegyed were changed. In 1946 Főherceg Sándor utca (Archduke Alexander Street) was renamed Bródy Sándor utca.Sándor Bródy (writer) (1863-1924) was a Jewish-born novelist, dramatist, and short-story writer who was 'among the first in Hungarian literature to focus attention on the urban proletariat, and the first to introduce the coarse and pungent vernacular of the big city into literary works'.  In the same year the metropolitan library in the former Wenckheim Palace was named the Szabó Ervin Library in honour of Ervin Szabó, a revolutionary socialist who translated the works of Marx and Engels into Hungarian and who in 1911 had been appointed the library's director. In 1949, Eszterházy utca and Ötpacsirta utca were renamed Puskin utca.  Two years later, in 1948, the section of Baross utca in front of the library was renamed Szabó Ervin tér Surprisingly, the communist regime did not rename the József körút (Joseph ringroad), named after the Archduke of Austria and Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, as it did the Teréz and Erzsébet stretches of the ringroad, also named after Habsburg monarchs. In 1950, Horánszky utca, named after Dual Monarchy-era Hungarian member of parliament and trade minister Nándor Horánszky, was renamed Makarenko utca, in honour of Soviet educational theorist Anton Makarenko. In 1962, Rökk Szillárd utca, named after a wealthy 19th century philanthropist, was renamed Somogyi Béla after a leftist journalist murdered by White forces in 1920.\nOf the Palotanegyed's eleven or so cafés which existed during Budapest's pre-war heyday, all except one vanished. The one survival, the Múzeum, though it calls itself a café-restaurant, is only a restaurant today. It closed during the Covid period and, as at January 2024, still has notreopened.\n\nSince 1989\nDespite the occasional acts of disdain and vandalism shown by the communist regime towards Budapest's historical fabric, the vast majority of the Palotanegyed's pre-World War II buildings survived war, revolution, Soviet occupation and the socialist decades.  At the same time, by the early post-communist period, the Józsefváros had acquired a reputation amongst Hungarians as the poorest and most crime-ridden of the Pest districts.  This reputation reflected the dilapidation and poverty especially of the outer part of the district (i.e. east of the Józsefkörút) and the proportionately high population of typically poor gypsies in that area.  This reputation coloured perceptions of the whole of Józsefváros, including, probably unfairly, the Palotanegyed. It was ironic given that historically the area had been one of the wealthiest parts of the city.\nOne of the early decisions of the post-1989 democratic authorities was to restore some pre-communist street names.  Horánszky utca and Ötpacsirta utca reappeared as did Rökk Szillárd, although, oddly, only at its southern end. Bródy Sándor utca, Puskin utca, Somogyi Béla (at its northern end) and Szabó Ervin tér remained unchanged. The 1930 statue of Count Nandor Zichy in front of what was his palace on Lőrinc pap tér returned.\nSince the mid-1990s, the Palotanegyed's fortunes have steadily recovered.  Many of the district's palaces have been restored, and slowly but surely other buildings are following suit.  Local and international investors have seen that the area combines charm and inner-city convenience.  And the Józsefváros local government has made much progress rebuilding the district's streets to make pedestrian-only areas, widen footpaths, rationalise parking, plant more trees and generally smarten the area up.  As of November 2022, areas completed include Reviczky utca, Ötpacsirta utca, Mikszáth Kálmán tér, the area between the Szabó Ervin library and Calvin tér, Lőrinc pap tér, Mária utca, Kőfaragó utca, Gyulai Pál utca, Horánszky utca, much of Krúdy utca, Gutenberg tér, Bródy Sándor utca between the Múzeum körút and Horánszky utca, Rökk Szillárd utca and Somogyi Béla utca. The mainly pedestrian area along Krúdy utca between Mikszáth Kálmán tér and Lőrinc pap tér thrives with restaurants and cafes in a way that wouldn't have been imagined before the 1989 changes.\nIn October 2022 the Józsefváros council announced that two further stretches of street renovation would be completed in the first half of 2023, Krúdy utca between Lőrinc pap tér and the Nagykörút and Mária utca between Lőrinc pap tér and Baross utca.\nIn May 2018 the Józsefváros council announced that funds had also been allocated for reconstruction of sections of Szentkirályi utca and that Puskin utca, Trefort utca and Somogyi Béla utca would also be renovated. In April 2019 the council reported that the street reconstruction project would be undertaken as part of the third phase of the Europe Inner Cities programme and would comprise, in addition to work now completed on Bródy Sándor utca and Rökk Szilárd utca, Szentkirályi utca between Bródy Sándor utca and Mikszáth Kálmán tér. Trefort utca and Pollack Mihály tér 'could also be renovated in the future'.\nIn July 2016 the media reported that the Hungarian National Museum's gardens would get a facelift, that three buildings belonging to Hungarian Radio – the former Károlyi and Eszterházy palaces on Pollack Mihály tér and the Magyar Rádio palace at Bródy Sándor utca 5–7 – would be renovated and used by the National Museum; that the two communist-era Hungarian Radio buildings on Pollack Mihály tér would be demolished; and that the green spaces around the original palaces would be restored. The National Museum garden restoration project was completed in April 2019.\nBut there was a change of plan and on 3 March 2020 the national government proposed legislation transferring ownership of the Hungarian Radio buildings in the Palotanegyed which were given to the National Museum in 2016, with the addition of Szentkírályi utca 25/A, 25/B and 27, to the Pázmány Péter Catholic University. The Parliament approved the plan on 31 March. It was reported in June 2019 that the Pázmány Péter Catholic University had also acquired the Kéményseprő ház (the ‘Chimney Sweep House’), the classicist building at Bródy Sándor utca 15 built 1851-5 and designed by Károly Hild, brother of the more famous Budapest architect József Hild, which would house the university's central offices. In November 2021 the winning design for the new campus was announced. The plan would involve the demolition of the two communist-era former Hungarian Radio buildings on Pollack Mihály tér and the project would be completed by 2026. In June 2023 it was reported that the plans for the new development had been delayed. They would now be completed by the spring of 2024 and the project was scheduled to be ready for the 2027 academic year.\nIn April 2018 it was announced that Blaha Lujza tér would undergo a major renovation with green spaces replacing the current car-park area.  At the same time, the 1926 Corvin Áruház (department store) would get a facelift with its communist-era aluminium layer removed and the original façade restored. Works were originally scheduled to be completed by the end of 2019, but the new Józsefváros council, elected in the October 2019 local elections, delayed the work while it reviewed the plans. Józsefváros deputy mayor Dániel Rádai was quoted in July 2020 saying that reconstruction of the square would start in the spring of 2021, at the same that the restoration of the facade of the Corvin Áruház, which was expected to take eighteen months. He also foreshadowed the reconstruction of so far unreconstructed streets in the Palace District, firstly Szentkirályi utca. In December 2020 it was reported that the work would begin in 2021 and be completed by the autumn of 2022. The project was completed in 2023.\nMore promising news for the district came with Budapest mayor Karácsony's announcement in early 2021 of his development plans for the city over the next seven years.  These include long-overdue improvements to Rákóczi út and Üllői út, both bordering one side in the Palace District.  Despite being lined with magnificent buildings, both have become unlovely major roads, difficult for pedestrians to cross and with long stretches treeless.  While the plan is currently short on detail, the stated aim will be to reduce road traffic, to give preference to public transport, to provide wider pedestrian areas and better provision for cycling and to plant more trees.\nIt was announced in July 2021 that the long empty and neglected turn of the 20th century former Hungarian Association of Civil Servants building at Puskin utca 4 would be restored and redeveloped.\n\nThe Palotanegyed Palaces\nExternal links\n Media related to Palace District (Budapest) at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n== References =="

At the time of the 2011 census, over two thirds of the population were Hindus. Over a quarter were Muslim, the largest minority religion. Small minorities of Christians and Jains also live here.\n\nAdministration\nHubli - Dharwad municipal corporation\nHubli–Dharwad Municipal Corporation is municipal corporation for twin cities of Hubli and Dharwad in Karnataka state in India. It was constituted in 1962 by combining two cities separated by a distance of 20 kilometers. The area covered by the corporation is 181.66 km2 (70.14 sq mi). spread over 45 revenue villages. The population of the twin cities as per the 2011 census is 943,788 of which 474,518 are males and 469,270 are female. Total literates are 727,103 of which 382,913 are males while 344,190 are female. The average literacy rate of Hubli and Dharwad city is 86.79 percent of which male and female literacy was 91.12 and 82.44. Hubli–Dharwad's population increased 22.99% between 1981 and 1991, from 527,108 to 648,298, and by 21.2% between 1991 and 2001. The municipality covers 191 km2 (74 sq mi).\n\nEconomy\nIndustrial and business development\nHubli–Dharwad is a 3rd fastest growing city, & developing industrial hub in Karnataka after state capital, with more than 1000 allied small and medium industries established in Gokul Road and Tarihal regions of Hubli. There are machine tools industries, electrical, steel furniture, food products, rubber and leather industries, and tanning industries.\nTo promote the overall economic development of industries, institutions and businesses, the Karnataka Chamber of Commerce & Industry was formed. It is one of the premier associations, which has been gaining momentum in achieving potential growth and prosperity in Hubli region. One key aspect of industrialisation for Hubballi-Dharwad was foundation of Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs), which aimed at providing hassle-free market conditions for farmers, to establish regulated and stimulated production of agricultural related commodities and goods.\n\nTransport\nAir\nHubli Airport (IATA: HBX, ICAO: VOHB) is a domestic airport serving the twin cities of Hubli-Dharwad and North Karnataka in the state of Karnataka, India. It is situated on Gokul Road, 8 kilometres from city center and 20 km (12 mi) from Dharwad. It is the third busiest airport in Karnataka & the 45th busiest airport in India. In March 2020, Hubli airport received the best airport award under government of India's Regional connectivity scheme. Hubli airport connects to 10 destinations throughout the country. Efforts are being taken to upgrade it to international standards.\n\nRail\nThe city currently has four stations and one Junction. The Hubli Junction railway station is the main railway station in the city with a built-up area of 161460 sq. ft. The other stations are Hubli South, Hubli East, Unkal, and Amargol.  Hubli is the headquarters of the South Western Railway zone. It was carved out as a zone from the current South Central Railway. It is the centre for the Hubli Division. The Hubli Division is one of the highest revenue-generating divisions in India. Hubli is well-connected by the Indian Rail Network. Hubli, an important railway junction, has trains connecting with major cities like Mumbai, New Delhi, Varanasi, Hyderabad, Tirupati, Vijaywada, Kolkata, Chennai Rameshwaram etc  In November 2019, the work for extending a platform was undertaken by the Railways at the estimated cost of 90 Cr. According to railway  officials, the length of the renewed platform is estimated at 1,400 meters, which would be longest in the world. The work is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2020. Hubbali also has a Heritage Rail museum. The Indian Railways currently has 11 railway museums across the country. For bringing glory to the proposed Rail Museum, narrow-gauge Railway Rolling Stocks, from different Railways are being displayed and work is moving at a rapid pace. It is proposed to collect photographs of Rail network going back to the 19th and early 20th century so that all old memories of Rail Journey can be part of the photo gallery in the proposed Rail Heritage Museum.\n\nRoad\nHubli lies on the \"Golden Quadrilateral\". Asian Highway 47 passes through Hubli. It lies on National Highway 63 (Ankola–Gooty) and National Highway 218 (Hubli–Humnabad), which connect Hubli with major cities in the region. NWKRTC (North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation) is a state-run corporation headquartered at Hubli. A semi ring road connecting NH4 (Mumbai-Chennai), NH67 (Ankola–Gooty) and NH218 (Hubli–Humnabad) with cloverleaf junction at Gabbur is already under construction.\n\nHubli-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System\nHubballi-Dharwad BRTS (also known as HDBRTS) is a bus rapid transit system built to serve the twin cities of Hubli and Dharwad, located in the North-Western part of Karnataka state in India. Hubballi-Dharwad BRTS (HDBRTS) project is a Government of Karnataka initiative to foster long-term economic growth in the region. The project promotes fast, safe, comfortable, convenient and affordable public transportation between the twin cities and aims to reduce congestion and air pollution in the region.\nThe length of the Hubballi-Dharwad BRTS corridor is 22.25 km (13.83 mi) from CBT Hubli to CBT–Dharwad with the width of the cross-sections ranging from 44 to 35 m (144 to 115 ft). The BRTS corridor includes segregated bus lanes, access-controlled bus stations, physical and fare integration with BRT feeder services, off-board ticketing through smart cards and bar-coded paper tickets, intelligent transport system and high-quality buses (Standard AC buses). The corridor is designed for operating regular and express services. It consists of two lanes for BRTS buses on either side of the median bus station facilitating overtaking lanes for express services. Foot overbridges at six locations, PELICAN signals, and synchronised signal management are proposed to facilitate the easy approach of passengers to bus stations.\n\nEducation\nHubballi, along with Dharwad, its twin city, is an education center in Karnataka, housing several educational institutions including one of the best medical colleges in Karnataka and also one of the IITs and one of the IIITs:\n\nKarnataka Institute of Medical Sciences, Hubballi, set up in 1957; also houses one of the largest hospitals in India and is one of the top three Govt.

        "content": "A lunar regolith simulant is a terrestrial material synthesized in order to approximate the chemical, mechanical, engineering, mineralogical, or particle-size distribution properties of lunar regolith. Lunar regolith simulants are used by researchers who wish to research the materials handling, excavation, transportation, and uses of lunar regolith. Samples of actual lunar regolith are too scarce, and too small, for such research, and have been contaminated by exposure to Earth's atmosphere.\n\nEarly simulants\nIn the run-up to the Apollo program, crushed terrestrial rocks were first used to simulate the anticipated soils that astronauts would encounter on the lunar surface. In some cases the properties of these early simulants were substantially different from actual lunar soil, and the issues associated with the pervasive, fine-grained, sharp dust grains on the Moon came as a surprise.\n\nLater simulants\nAfter Apollo and particularly during the development of the Constellation program, there was a large proliferation of lunar simulants produced by different organizations and researchers. Many of these were given three-letter acronyms to distinguish them (e.g., MLS-1, JSC-1), and numbers to designate subsequent versions. These simulants were broadly divided into highlands or mare soils, and were usually produced by crushing and sieving analogous terrestrial rocks (anorthosite for highlands, basalt for mare). Returned Apollo and Luna samples were used as reference materials in order to target specific properties such as elemental chemistry or particle size distribution. Many of these simulants were criticized by prominent lunar scientist Larry Taylor for a lack of quality control and wasted money on features like nanophase iron that had no documented purpose.\n\nJSC-1 and -1A\nJSC-1 (Johnson Space Center Number One) was a lunar regolith simulant that was developed in 1994 by NASA and the Johnson Space Center. Its developers intended it to approximate the lunar soil of the maria.  It was sourced from a basaltic ash with a high glass content.\nIn 2005, NASA contracted with Orbital Technologies Corporation (ORBITEC) for a second batch of simulant in three grades:\n\nJSC-1AF, fine, 27 µm average size\nJSC-1A, a reproduction of JSC 1, less than 1 mm size\nJSC-1AC, coarse, a distribution of sizes < 5 mm\nNASA received 14 metric tons of JSC-1A, and one ton each of AF and AC in 2006. Another 15 tons of JSC-1A and 100 kg of JSC-1F were produced by ORBITEC for commercial sale, but ORBITEC is no longer selling simulants and was acquired by the Sierra Nevada Corporation. An 8-ton sand box of commercial JSC‐1A is available for daily rental from the NASA Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI).\nJSC-1A can geopolymerize in an alkaline solutions resulting in a hard, rock-like, material. Tests show that the maximum compressive and flexural strength of the 'lunar' geopolymer is comparable to that of conventional cements.\n\nJSC-1 and JSC-1A are now no longer available outside of NASA centers.\n\nNU-LHT and OB-1\nTwo lunar highlands simulants, the NU-LHT (lunar highlands type) series and OB-1 (olivine-bytownite) were developed and produced in anticipation of the Constellation activities. Both of these simulants are sourced mostly from rare anorthosite deposits on the Earth. For NU-LHT the anorthosite came from the Stillwater complex, and for OB-1 it came from the Shawmere Anorthosite in Ontario. Neither of these simulants were widely distributed.\n\nRecent simulants\nMost of the previously developed lunar simulants are no longer being produced or distributed outside of NASA. Multiple companies have tried to sell regolith simulants for profit, including Zybek Advanced Products, ORBITEC, and Deep Space Industries. None of these efforts have seen much success. NASA is unable to sell simulants, or distribute unlimited amounts for free; however, NASA can award set amounts of simulant to grant winners.\nSeveral lunar simulants have been developed recently and are either being sold commercially or are available for rent inside large regolith bins.

        "content": "Anantnag (Kashmiri pronunciation: [/ə'nʌntna:g/ or /-nɑːg/] ), also called Islamabad, is the administrative headquarters of Anantnag district of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir in the disputed Kashmir region.  It is located at a distance of 53 kilometres (33 miles) from the union territory's capital Srinagar. It is the third largest city in Jammu and Kashmir after Srinagar and Jammu with an urban agglomerate population of  159,838  and a municipal limit population of 109,433.\n\nName\nThe town has been called by both the names Islamabad and Anantnag. The latter is characterised by Marc Aurel Stein as its \"Hindu name\".\n\"Anantnag\" derives from the name of the spring at the southern end of the town, whose Sanskrit name Anantanāga was mentioned in the Nilamata Purana and other texts. According to the Gazetteer of Kashmir and Ladak, it is named after Ananta, the great serpent of Vishnu and the emblem of eternity.\nThe name Islamabad is believed to have derived from the name of a Mughal governor Islam Khan who built a garden in the area.\nBoth names are used for the town, Anantnag being preferred by the Hindus and Sikhs while Islamabad is preferred by the Muslims. The locals continue to use the name Islamabad, even though the Indian security forces deployed in the area from 1998 onwards frown on its use.\nDuring the Dogra rule, Anantnag/Islamabad was the headquarters of one of Kashmir Valley's three districts, which was referred to as the \"Anantnag wazarat\".\n\nGeography\nAnantnag is located at 33.73°N 75.15°E﻿ / 33.73; 75.15, at an elevation of 5,300 feet (1,600 m) above sea level, at a distance of 53 kilometres (33 mi) from Srinagar on NH 44 (former name NH 1A before renumbering of all national highways).\n\nDemographics\nThere are three definitions of Anantnag:\n\nAnantnag Municipal Council: population in 2011: 109,433, area: 15.72 km2 (6.07 sq mi).\nAnantnag city including outgrowths: population in 2011: 150,592, area: 37.94 km2 (14.65 sq mi).\nAnantnag Urban Agglomeration: population in 2011: 159,838, area: 40.44 km2 (15.61 sq mi).\nIncluding outgrowths, in 2011 the city's population had 77,508 males (52%) and 72,690 females (48%). There were 25,102 (16.7%) age 0–6: 13,528 males (54%) and 11,574 females (46%).  The literacy rate for the people over six was 73.8% (males 81.0%, females 66.2%).\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe local body for Anantnag is called Municipal Council Anantnag. Anantnag has 25 wards. The local body elections in Anantnag took place in 2018 in which the party Indian National Congress won 20 wards and BJP won 3 wards. The President and Vice President are the elected heads of the Municipal Council. The elections are indirect elections. Hilal Ahmed Shah is the President of Municipal Council Anantnag.\n\nDistrict Development Council\nChairperson: Yousuf Gorsi (JKNC)\nVice-chairpwrson: Javaid Ahmad (JKPDP)\n\nSites\nMasjid Baba Dawood Khaki is among the oldest mosques in the city, being built around 1400 CE.\nThe Martand Sun Temple is one of the important archaeological sites of Kashmir, built around 500 CE. It temple is situated at Kehribal, 9 km east-north-east of Anantnag and south of Mattan. This famous Sun Temple was destroyed by Ruler namely Sikander Buthshikan of Shahmiri Dynasty.\n\nEconomy\nIn 2010 Anantnag was declared as major City of Export excellence with a total GDP of $3.7 billion. The high GDP of Anantnag is due to the centralised position and presence of high concentration of troops and migrant labours in it. Anantnag has a strategic position lying on the main North-South Corridor Road and with the highest number of tourist destinations it an economic hub of Kashmir Valley. The city suffered heavily during conflict times of the 1990s; many roads, bridges, and government buildings were reduced to ash. But in the 2000s, it made a quick recovery. It has been listed among 100 fastest economically developing cities.\n\nTransport\nRoad\nSrinagar is 53 km from Anantnag on NH 44 (former name NH 1A before renumbering of all national highways). The distances of some other towns from Anantnag are: Achabal 10 km, Kokarnag 23 km, Doru Shahabad 20 km and Pahalgam 39 km. The city is served by National Highway 44. The city is gateway to the Kashmir valley as one side of Jawahar Tunnel opens here.\n\nRail\nAnantnag (ANT) is a station on the 119 km (74 mi) long Banihal-Baramulla line that started in October 2009 and connects Baramulla (BRML) and Srinagar to Banihal (BAHL), Qazigund. The railway track also connects to Banihal across the Pir Panjal mountains through a newly constructed 11 km long Banihal tunnel, and subsequently to the Indian railway network after a few years. It takes approximately 9 minutes and 30 seconds for a train to cross the tunnel. It is the longest rail tunnel in India. This railway system, proposed in 2001, is not expected to connect the Indian railway network until 2017 at the earliest, with a cost overrun of 55 billion INR. The train also runs during heavy snow across the Kashmir Valley.\n\nEducation\nThere are numerous primary, middle secondary and higher secondary schools in the city. Of the higher education, the following establishments are notable:\n\nUniversity of Kashmir South Campus, Anantnag\nGovernment Medical College, Anantnag\nIndustrial Training Institute, Anantnag\nGovernment Degree College for Boys, Anantnag\nGovernment College for Women, Anantnag\nGovernment Boys Model Higher Secondary School, Brakpora, Anantnag\nAl Ahad College of Education, Anantnag\nJamia College of Education, Anantnag\nGovernment Polytechnic College Anantnag\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n Anantnag travel guide from Wikivoyage\nArticles about Anantnag in The Economic Times\n\"Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns (Provisional)\".

        "content": "== Announcement date ==\nI'd argue that we should consider January 11, 2019 to have been the date the campaign was announced, not January 17. That is more accurately the date of her official launch. Look at Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign, we consider the April 12 video announcement to have been the date she announced her campaign not the June 13, 2015 campaign launch rally. SecretName101 (talk) 01:32, 17 January 2019 (UTC)\n\nCampaign Issues\nI would like to propose we add a section regarding Tulsi's stances on the issues from her campaign issue website tulsigabbard.org  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Scottmontana (talk • contribs) 21:36, 20 January 2019 (UTC)\n\nPacific Islander?\nWould Tulsi Gabbard in fact be the first Pacific Islander as president, given that Barack Obama was born in Hawaiʻi?    → Michael J Ⓣ Ⓒ Ⓜ 17:51, 21 January 2019 (UTC)\n\n@Michael J: Gabbard is ethnically Samoan.

They are certainly reliable sources for the opinions expressed in them. I would rather avoid however posting accusations in dubious sources about Gabbard, then rebutting them with other opinion pieces. And note I am consistent with this policy based view regardless of the subject and their views. If editors could agree to rely on using sources in mainstream publications and stories and opinions that have been reported across them, then we have a chance to have a reasonable article. TFD (talk) 21:20, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\nThanks for this link!  In fact, I had only seen your preceding post where you mention Perennial sources as an \"edit conflict\" at first. (sorry) It's interesting how few sources are mentioned on that page, but I guess there have only been so many discussions at RS/N. While I'm not sure I share your optimism about the mainstream/corporate media, it's true there are one or two dissident billionaires out there. ^^ Comparing this en.wp page's number of views to the number of views of the interview with TG on the Joe Rogan show, it looks like maybe a lot of people are not entirely satisfied with the corporate media echo chamber. ~  SashiRolls  t ·   c 06:26, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nI don't understand why a broad question about reliable sources is under the heading smear campaign. In any case, the question in unanswerable without knowing the context of the proposed content. In general though, those seem to be low-to-very-low- quality sources.- MrX 🖋 21:40, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\nAll the articles or videos cited talk in one way or another about a DNC/media campaign to marginalize Gabbard. ~  SashiRolls  t ·   c 06:26, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nThen no, those would not be reliable sources.- MrX 🖋 10:52, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\n\nReversion of edit\nUser:SashiRolls recently reverted my entire edit based on a single WikiLink. Before I get into an edit war, I'd like for him or her to explain why he or she reverted the entire edit instead of simply removing a link. The edit contained a number of improvements to the article other than the link.\nTo be quite frank, SashiRolls, you seem like you're biased in favor of Gabbard and trying to defend her. You seem determined to prove that it's all just a \"smear campaign\" against her. Wikipedia is not a place for you to push your politics. I don't believe that you are editing with with the intention to truly improve the article, but rather, simply \"defend\" Gabbard. In my view, the article already does a good job of expressing neutrality. The word \"allegations\" inherently expressed that the claims are not verified, there is a mention of journalists accusing the media of a smear campaign, etc. The fact that you're trying to find all these obscure, unreliable sources that accuse the DNC of trying to sabotage Gabbard (which sounds like a blatant conspiracy theory) indicates to me that you want to try to protect her reputation. Silver181 (talk) 17:02, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\n\nWe do not need links to Russian media outlets on the page. Everyone knows what Sputnik, RT, etc. are.  We do not POV-push DNC-conspiracy theories here. ~  SashiRolls  t ·   c 18:33, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nLOL! You're accusing me of pushing a DNC narrative by adding links to news outlets, which is common practice? You are literally admitting your bias with this comment. This is Wikipedia. You have absolutely no proof that there are \"DNC conspiracy theories\" afoot. YOU are the one pushing conspiracy theories that the DNC is trying to sabotage Gabbard.\nI can say with near certainty that you are not editing in good faith. You are editing to protect Gabbard's reputation. I do not believe that you can be trusted to edit this article further without incorporating your bias into your edits. Stop trying to politicize the article.\nAlso, I like how you didn't address at all the other improvements that I made to the article. Nice job at dodging my actual question and immediately jumping to accusing me of being a DNC shill. Silver181 (talk) 18:38, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nOf course we should link the Russia media articles as is standard practice. I dispute that everyone knows what they are. I support Silver181's version as on overall improvement to the article. I think it's unreasonable to disparage the DNC or to refer to what's reported in reliable sources as a conspiracy theory.- MrX 🖋 18:48, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nI think I'll just leave AmPol2 to the trolls.  Adding big blue-links to Russian media entries is obviously not standard practice, except for folks like Cirt (and others in his cabal). It is rhetoric.  Ciao. ~  SashiRolls  t ·   c 18:52, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nIf you would assume good faith and try to work collaboratively with other editors, we could improve this article with minimal heat. It is common practice to wikilink to other articles with the exception of very common terms. I'm trying to understand why you view it as issue, or if you have an policy-based argument for why we should not link RT (which could be anything) or Sputnik (which could be a satellite).- MrX 🖋 18:58, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\n\nDaily Beast & NBC hit pieces\nShould we include the Daily Beast & NBC hit pieces here?  I've removed the Daily Beast article from her BLP as it is more concerned with her campaign, but has not yet been deemed sufficiently notable to add here.  The text was as follows:\n\nThe campaign drew attention after The Daily Beast reported that it had received contributions from several individuals sympathetic to Russia and Vladimir Putin, including Stephen F. Cohen and an RT employee. Gabbard called the story fake news.\n\nI'll dig up the NBC hit piece (& rebuttal) if anyone thinks the smear campaign should be covered in an encyclopedia.  Will it be relevant in 10 years? ~  SashiRolls  t ·   c 19:26, 22 May 2019 (UTC)\n\nI've gone ahead and added a section to cover the smear campaign. ~  SashiRolls  t ·   c 20:37, 22 May 2019 (UTC)\nA couple of things: they are not hit pieces. They are factual reporting, which you have errantly described as allegations. How is it that a report by a reputable source, picked up by other reputable sources, is a hit piece and \"smear\", when two opinion articles, apparently ignored by other reputable sources, is just fine?- MrX 🖋 21:09, 22 May 2019 (UTC)\nStephen F. Cohen contributed $1,100 dollars to TULSI NOW. In 2017-2018 he donated $10,800 to Warren campaigns, $4,000 for Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, $2,700 for FRIENDS OF SHERROD BROWN, $1,250 for Congressman Andy Kim, $1,000 for Congresswomam Nanette Barragán and $500 for Sam Jammal, a former Obama official in an unsuccessful bid for Congress.[5]\nContrary to the claim made in the Daily Beast, Cohen is not a professor at NYU but is retired. He is a contributing editor to The Nation, which is edited by his wife. It's misleading polemical writing disguised as journalism that Wikipedia was a policy of weight. One or two misleading articles are insufficient for inclusion. \"An article should not give undue weight to minor aspects of its subject, but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight proportional to its treatment in the body of reliable, published material on the subject.\"\nSo someone with a record of making dozens of contributions to Democratic candidates over the years made a relatively small donation to another Democratic candidate in 2019. No wonder the story has been ignored by mainstream media. And I note that even in highly polemical sources, that the information is not being used against any of the other politicians to whose campaigns he contributed.\nI note that Snooganssnoogans valiantly defends Warren on her article's talk page. (\"When recounting the family lore about Native American ancestry, Warren said that her \"aunt Bea\" remarked that they had high cheekbones like Bea believed Native Americans had. You want this trivia included in the article? With a description of Warren as someone who espouses racism?\") I recommend they show consistency across articles, regardless of the party line.\nTFD (talk) 23:50, 22 May 2019 (UTC)\nI can't speak for the Elizabeth Warren campaign article, nor would I support suppressing unflattering information about her, but I believe the native American controversy predates her campaign. The Daily Beast erred by omitting the word \"emeritus\" in describing Cohen, but that's not really that important anyway. Notably, he has been vocal in his pro-Russia views and his support of Gabbard.[6]\nIf I understand correctly, you seem to object to this material because you think that the sources (more than just a couple) are not treating Gabbard fairly. That viewpoint is already represented by the Intercept and Rolling Stone, but it doesn't diminish the many more sources about contributions from pro-Russia sympathizers, Gabbard's stance on Syria, and the pro-Gabbard Russian propaganda campaign. Are you suggesting that we leave this out? That would reduce this article to little more than a campaign brochure. - MrX 🖋 11:08, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\nNo I do not and never have objected to material because it treats a subject unfairly. It is not up to Wikipedia editors to determine what coverage is fair or not, but to follow policy which says, \"An article should not give undue weight to minor aspects of its subject, but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight proportional to its treatment in the body of reliable, published material on the subject.\"\nWe are discussing an article about contributions to Gabbard's campaign, not Syria.\nObviously Snooganssnoogans has a different editing history from you, but compare your treatment of this topic with Hillary Clinton. When someone wants]ed to add information about Clinton's role in mass incarceration, you wrote, \"I'm suspicious of the timing of this \"research\" that comes out more than 15 years after the fact. I think it overstates Hillary's influence, and is largely the opinion of one person.... I never said the article was an opinion piece, however, the author makes a number of conclusions colored with her opinion.\" (19 Feb. 2016) We should not use different rules for different people.\nTFD (talk) 17:23, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\nWhile I agree that we should not use different rules for different people, I don't think the correction needs to occur here. There is not a great deal of coverage in the media about Gabbard. The Russia angle stands out in the coverage about her, so it's hard to ignore whether it's fair or not. There seem to be two main points of view: (1) she has taken positions viewed as favorable to Russia, so Russia and Russia's surrogates tend to support her, and (2) the media is unfairly smearing her with undue coverage about #1. Point two should be covered in this article (and probably the bio), but with proportionally less volume to reflect its coverage in the press. My main concern now is not so much about how the content in this article is written (although it can be improved). My objections is calling the campaign contributions and Russian propaganda \"allegations\", a characterization that is not in widespread use in sources, and thus should not be made in Wikipedia's voice, if at all.\nI remember writing that comment about Clinton's fairly minor role in mass incarceration and I still stand by that view. By contrast, the viewpoint of the apparent Russia-Gabbard quid pro quo is contemporary with her campaign, so it's very relevant to this article. - MrX 🖋 18:18, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\n@MrX: Are you claiming Gabbard has a role (other than being anti-interventionist) in how she is being reported?  You seem to be suggesting there is a \"tit for tat\" (quid pro quo) relationship.  Could you provide a reference for that claim?  Thanks.~  SashiRolls  t ·   c 19:17, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\nGabbard has articulated positions that many view as pro-Russian, so in that respect, she has a role, although it may be unwitting. Unfortunately, she probably hurt her credibility by calling it fake news.- MrX 🖋 21:44, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\nIt may be reasonable to limit the depth of coverage, but there's mentions from ABC, and CNN, in addition to the sources already mentioned. It's garnered enough coverage that we can also mention Gabbard's response and the criticisms of the reporting from Taibbi and Greenwald. Nblund talk 19:49, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\nI hope you don't mind me restoring your remark to level 1, since you are responding to the original question.  Feel free to restore your original threading if you really feel it necessary.  I would like an answer from Mr X concerning their claim of a \"tit for tat\" relationship with Russia.  I want to know if he has evidence or if it was just gratuitous.  I appreciated your edits of my copy Nblund... your text is much better. Thanks.   ~  SashiRolls  t ·   c 20:01, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\n\nIn fact there is a great deal of media coverage about Tulsi Gabbard, it's just that there is more coverage about each and every other candidate who has qualified for the debates. Google News returns 82,400 articles about her,[7] which is less than John Hickenlooper for example at 93,700 articles[8] or Kamala Harris with 7,340,000 hits. We have to decide what information to add and what to omit. Fortunately, Wikipedia has a policy called Balancing aspects, which provides assistance: \"An article should not give undue weight to minor aspects of its subject, but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight proportional to its treatment in the body of reliable, published material on the subject.\"\nThat means that stories ignored in mainstream media should be ignored. According to Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources, the Daily Beast has been found to be \"\"largely an opinion piece aggregator\", for which special care must be taken for use in supporting controversial statements of fact related to biographies of living persons.\" The site's role is to provide positive information about people it likes and negative information about people it doesn't with very ittle regard for the fairness of its reporting. With 82 thousand articles about Gabbard, there is no need to scrape the bottom of the barrel.\nWhether the fact that 3 out of 80,000+ contributers to Gabbard had said positive things about Russia is more important than Clinton supporting mass incarceration is easy to establish by the degree of coverage. Politifact for example has an article about it.[9] Hillary campaigned for her husband in 1996 and spoke in support of the crime bill (\"we have to bring them to heel.\")\nSorry, but could you explain your \"quid pro quo\" comment or strike it out as a BLP violation.\nTFD (talk) 20:20, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\nI wrote apparent quid pro quo, meaning that the sources imply an apparent quid pro quo. The references cited establish that perception quite clearly. For example \"But Gabbard's most controversial position and the one where she's most in line with Russian interests is on Syria.\" and \"RT began defending Gabbard as soon as she announced.\" - MrX 🖋 21:55, 23 May 2019 (UTC)\nAccording to the Legal Dictionary, quid pro quo means \"The mutual consideration that passes between two parties to a contractual agreement, thereby rendering the agreement valid and binding.\"[10] Nowhere in the Daily Beast article is it claimed that there was an agreement between Tulsi Gabbard and the three donors. The fact the article left you with that false impression shows how effective it is. TFD (talk) 00:02, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nI think we both know that I wasn't using the term in a legal sense. - MrX 🖋 21:00, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nReally? What other definition is there? It literally means in Latin \"something for something,\" TFD (talk) 03:56, 27 May 2019 (UTC)\nPersonally, I would probably remove the entire \"Allegations of Russian support\" section. If anything, this belongs to page Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections, why do not we have such page already? Here is why. As the publication correctly tells, \"Experts in Russian on-line propaganda say Gabbard appeals to pro-Russian sites because her positions —and her appeal as an outsider in her own party — can be used to create division among Democrats.\" This has little to do with the candidate who actually \"had cosponsored legislation calling for an independent investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election\", etc. Could be kept here too though. My very best wishes (talk) 02:43, 27 May 2019 (UTC)\nThe problem is that NBC is the only major medium that his published this particular theory. TFD (talk) 04:28, 27 May 2019 (UTC)\nThis is not a problem, but a reason for inclusion per WP:NPOV. There is no requirement for content to be covered in all major newspapers. However, it is important that the controversy was covered in six sources currently cited on the page.My very best wishes (talk) 16:11, 27 May 2019 (UTC)\nSee also this ref. Once again, this is NOT just \"Daily Beast & NBC hit pieces\" as your title misleadingly tell. My very best wishes (talk) 16:19, 27 May 2019 (UTC)\nThe United States has five major cable news networks: ABC, CBS, MSNBC, Fox and CNN and four major broadsheets: the New York Times, the Washington Post, the LA Times and the Chicago Tribune. If a story about a public figure is significant, it will appear in all of them. The story about Kamala Harris' appearance on Breakfast Television was covered in all these sources, yet you still thought it was UNDUE for inclusion in her article.\nI don't understand what standard you are using for weight. If you would explain that to me, with reference to policy, then perhaps we could come to some sort of agreement on content.\nTFD (talk) 20:26, 27 May 2019 (UTC)\n@The Four Deuces: @My very best wishes: @MrX: @SashiRolls: I removed the portion sourced by The Daily Beast. You can see the explanation in my edit here. The Daily Beast has made these \"donation\" articles many times in the past.----ZiaLater (talk) 21:20, 8 June 2019 (UTC)\n\nIsn't it important to mention Gabbard's response? She denounced the allegations as \"fake news\", which was mentioned prior to your edit. I wasn't aware that Beast wasn't considered reliable until recently, so I'm not necessarily opposing the removal of info about that article, but shouldn't Gabbard's response be mentioned? Just mentioning the allegations without mentioning her response seems to give the impression that she hasn't responded to them. On the other hand, did she technically not respond to the NBC report specifically? I had thought her \"fake news\" statement was referring to all of the allegations, but some of the things that I'm reading indicate that it was more directed at the Beast stuff. Silver181 (talk) 23:33, 8 June 2019 (UTC)\nZiaLater I read your explanation, but I have been arguing that it does not matter that the Daily Beast story is unreliable, RS have reported on the controversy surrounding the story:\nRolling Stone: \"We’ve Hit a New Low in Campaign Hit Pieces\"\nABC News: \"2020 candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard presses that US must not go to war with Iran\" (where she calls Beast story 'fake news')\nNational Review: \"Should We Be Worried About Candidates Accepting Donations from ‘Russophiles’?\"\nPolitico: \"Gabbard calls unflattering report 'fake news'\"\nMSN: (same Politco story above.)\nThe Hill: \"Gabbard says claim her campaign is getting boost from Putin apologists is 'fake news'\"\nCNN: \"Tulsi Gabbard invokes Trump's 'fake news' rhetoric to push back on report of Russia-linked support\"\nThere aren't that many stories devoted to her, so this controversy seems significant.  Kolya Butternut (talk) 00:07, 9 June 2019 (UTC)\nGoogle news lists 70,400 articles that mention her.[11] If people want to read highly partisan conspiracy theories, they can tune into Alex Jones or Rachel Maddow, except even they have ignored this story. I'm surprised you aren't talking about how she wasn't born in the United States. TFD (talk) 06:13, 9 June 2019 (UTC)\nThe question is whether or how much to give weight to the story.  How does the coverage of this story compare to other stories about her campaign?  Kolya Butternut (talk) 19:06, 9 June 2019 (UTC)\n\nRhetorical blue highlighting and bad faith: a primer\nYou asked what a rhetorical blue-link is, MrX.  In the first sentence of this paragraph the brand new journalist Silver181 added a blue link to the word \"support\" that directs the reader to \"cyberwarfare by Russia\".  This is a tactic eerily similar to what Cirt & the gang were using while astroturfing their dozens of book review reviews about Trump. (further examples here). This page is such a textbook example, I'll add it to my textbook.  Bravo, in particular, for the \"Policies\" section where whoever it was managed to make the first highlighted words under policy be \"legalization of recreational cannibas\" and \"decriminalization of sex work\".  According to en.wp, these are TG's most important policies.  Where did that sex work bit come from?  Buzzfeed.  And who added that blue link? \nEither you, MrX, or Silver181 has also reverted my correction of a citation error  \"accidentally\" introduced by the latter: Greenwald has not debunked the Beast article as they rewrote the entry to say: he & Taibbi debunked the NBC News article.  I also tried to fix for the second time the silly claim that we can source TG calling the NBC News article \"fake news\" to the NBC News article itself.  Such trolling is why I think I'd be better off keeping my sanity and leaving AmPol to the regulars (like Cirt / Tarc / etc.) Cf.  WP:GNAT (Give No Aid to Trolls). ~  SashiRolls  t ·   c 19:47, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\n\nMate, no offense, but you've got a bit of a persecution complex going on. I'd rather not discuss my personal politics here, but since you're clearly implying that I'm some sort of neoliberal troll who's out to get Gabbard, I'll just say this: I consider myself to be left-wing and a progressive. I agree with Gabbard on many issues and I do believe that the media is exaggerating the extent of Russian support for Gabbard. I have no idea who \"Cirt\" is, either. Regardless, I would consider the link that I added to \"support\" to be accurate in this instance; if the allegations are true, that would be cyberwarfare. I'm also not sure what you're getting at when you say things like \"whoever it was\" with the policy section. Are you implying that I'm trying to make Gabbard seem like some looney by putting cannabis and prostitution policies there? I wasn't the one who put the crime section first, nor was I the one who added the info about sex work and cannabis.

Firstly, I'm not a journalist. I believe that my responsibility as a Wikipedia editor is to try to state unbiased facts, not tabloid journalism. Secondly, my account is almost six months old and has over two hundred edits. I'm not some troll that created an account yesterday just to vandalize. Also, if you're trying to suggest that I'm a sock puppet of \"Cirt\", then... I don't even know what to say. Why would this \"Cirt\" create an account six months ago and readily make edits with it just to spread \"conspiracies\" about Tulsi Gabbard that first started circulating, what, a week ago? That would be some incredible foresight on Cirt's part.\nSecondly, I'm just using \"mate\" in the same way that one would use \"dude\" or \"man\".\nThirdly, you're... accusing me of gaslighting now? That just proves my point about the persecution complex. You're assuming that I'm \"out to get you\" for some reason. If you want proof that I'm left-wing, look at my edit history. Notice how almost all, if not all, of the political pages that I've edited have been about Democrats? Silver181 (talk) 20:36, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nI didn't say I thought you were the CIRT.~  SashiRolls  t ·   c 20:45, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nI'm not sure why this needs such an inflammatory heading, but let me attempt to respond to your concerns. The link to cyberwarfare by Russia is not unreasonable, but not ideal per WP:EGG. I don't know Cirt, but if you have concerns about sock puppetry, SPI is the place you oughta be.\nConcerning the material under crime, I don't see a major issue, but I do think the content I wrote under 'Marijuana' was more informative. Silver181 can you explain why you removed the detail about the bill?\nThe word \"debunk/debunked\" is not the article, so I'm not sure what you're referring to. Gabbard did dismiss the reporting about pro-Russia contributions as fake news, which is accurately reflected in the article. Am I missing something?- MrX 🖋 20:15, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nMrX, you wrote: I don't know Cirt, which is just really funny since you worked so closely with them on so many articles: (interaction analyzer).~  SashiRolls  t ·   c 20:42, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nOh, you mean Sagecandor!

Didn't realize that you just added it. I can merge it with the \"Crime\" section. Silver181 (talk) 20:19, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nIt seems odd that you agree with retaining negative information from the Daily Beast, which is rated as \"no consensus\" under Perennial sources, yet you removed reliably sourced information that Kamala Harris's \"has been met with opposition by fellow members of the African American community....\"[12] You wrote, \"It does not matter if it was sourced, it is highly biased and the person who originally made the edits appears to have an agenda against Harris. Some random singer opposing Harris is not relevant information.\" Is there any reason why we should apply a different standard to Gabbard than to Harris? TFD (talk) 20:45, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nNo, they should be held to the same standards, but I don't consider the scenarios to be the same. The person who added the edits to Harris' page legitimately had an agenda against Harris. He had made numerous edits that were thinly-veiled insults on her main page and her campaign page (for example, he added a comment saying something akin to \"she only supported legalizing marijuana after it became popular\", which is clearly meant as an insult). I also did not feel as though the \"criticism\" that the user added is on the same level as the info about Gabbard. He literally said that a single musician opposed Harris. Like... so what? That isn't enough to make a sweeping claim that she's unpopular amongst many black people. The accusations against Gabbard are actual news stories that are being pushed by the media, and I'd consider them an important chapter of her campaign, especially since so little has occured. With Harris, the editor made some comment about Harris' actions as attorney general of Cali, not as a presidential candidate. I feel that those comments would better fit her main page, where her tenure as AG is actually discussed. I'd also like to note that I gave the editor who made the edits advice on how to incorporate the info into the article in a more neutral way, but he never did so, and instead resorted to insulting me on my user talk page. Silver181 (talk) 21:02, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\nThe contributions by three \"Russian sympathizers\" is not being pushed by the media, it's being pushed by a highly partisan source with dubious reliability, according to Wikipedia editors,. Also, using your criteria, I don't see how three out of tens of thousands of donors are really, really important, while a named singer is not. Besides, you also removed that Harris' actions as AG had been criticized by a number of Democratic politicians and the ACLU. In any case, it does not matter what editors consider to be important but what reliable sources do, per weight.  TFD (talk) 21:22, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\n\"Harris's presidential campaign has been met with opposition by fellow members of the African American community...\"\nThat is what the editor typed. Would you not consider this to be a loaded statement, given the fact that he only cited a musician as evidence? Notice how he didn't even say some fellow members of the African-American community, he just said members. That's an incredible stretch that gives a clear implication of Harris having received widespread condemnation from African-Americans.\n\"In particular, her actions concerning police brutality against minorities under her tenure as Attorney General of California are of concern.\"\nA single opinion article. A few weeks ago, the conservative (and, to some extent, neo-liberal) media was really pushing the whole \"Bernie Sanders went on a honeymoon in the Soviet Union in the 80s, which proves he's a communist!\" narrative. I could easily take an opinion article from, say, Fox News and add it to Bernie Sanders' page with a message like \"Sanders' visit to the Soviet Union in the 1980s is a matter of concern\", even though it's a mostly unimportant opinion piece being largely spread by people who are openly opposed to Sanders. I agree that most of the Gabbard controversy is overblown. However, some in the (supposedly) \"neutral\" media are legitimately accusing Gabbard of having Russian support, just like how some in the media accused Andrew Yang of having alt-right support. Progressives dislike Kamala Harris, sure. A non-opinion article stating something like \"Progressives are pushing back against Kamala Harris\" or something would be much better than an opinion piece.\n\"In 2015, Harris opposed a bill requiring the Attorney General's office to investigate officer-involved shootings. She then objected to enforcing California law regulating the use of body cameras by law enforcement. These moves were criticized by many left-leaning reformers, including Democratic state senators, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and a San Franciscan elected public defender.\"\nSomething that occurred while she was AG. This could possibly fit into a policy section, but there would have to be some relevance to her current campaign. If I recall correctly, Harris opposed weed legalization as AG, but has made support for legalization part of her 2020 platform. This situation is pretty common with 2020 candidates, but virtually all of their pages state their current position on the issue. Has she addressed the issue of body cameras again on the campaign trail, or since she even became a Senator?\n\"A much more accurate statement would be something like \"Harris has received criticism from some progressives for her criminal justice record\" or something along those lines. At the same time, if you make a statement like that, you also would need to cite examples of people or groups that have supported her. Only mentioning criticism of her (while also greatly exaggerating the extent of that criticism) without mentioning support that she has received is why I removed your edits in the first place. Wikipedia is not a place for you to vent your frustration with candidates or promote your agenda. If we're going to talk about criticism of her- which, don't get me wrong, we should, as some progressives have, indeed, already targeted her- we need to balance it out with mentions of support.\"\nWhat I said to the editor on the talk page. I gave him or her advice on how to phrase it better and even encouraged him or her to add info about it. But he or she thought it would be better to vandalize my talk page. An as for the \"balance it out with support\" thing, that's what's been done on this article. We have articles from journalists denouncing the allegations as hit pieces/smears/etc. and Gabbard's own response. I'd say the article is currently very neutral in that regard and doesn't give more credence to either side. We could maybe add a quote or something from one of the articles that specifically addresses a part of the allegations. Silver181 (talk) 21:55, 24 May 2019 (UTC)\n\nBack to the subject, which is TG, not Kamala Harris: I'm glad you appreciate the balance added to the \"New Knowledge\" and Larkay/Stein narratives. There was no balance in either case when they were first added to her BLP. \nI notice the words \"opposed to regime change\" are not mentioned anywhere on this page, despite them being the centerpiece of her candidacy.   Neither is the fact that TG was on the foreign affairs committee from 2013-2019 (which was deleted from her BLP with a deceptive edit summary) and on the armed services committee from 2013.  Just to be clear why I think it is important to get this terminology right: anti-interventionist is not a precise synonym for opposing regime change.  Many were opposed to intervening in Kuwait during the first Gulf war, though it was not a regime change war.\nNow that there seems to be agreement that we are here to write an encyclopedic entry and not simply to repeat placed DNC-pieces, perhaps I'll start editing the mainspace page again and add some sources about her well-known opposition to regime change in Venezuela and Iran. 🌿   SashiRolls  t ·   c 08:40, 25 May 2019 (UTC)\nI am not saying you were wrong in your position in the Harris article, but that you appear to be applying a different standard to this one. In this arguing, you are supporting the inclusion of an article in a publication which Wikipedia has found no consensus for reliability and which mainstream media have ignored. If you applied the same standards to Kamala Harris, it would read like a National Enquirer article. TFD (talk) 16:55, 25 May 2019 (UTC)\nI asked about in on NPOVN. TFD (talk) 19:29, 25 May 2019 (UTC)\n\nI wasn't aware that Beast isn't considered a reliable source. Silver181 (talk) 21:45, 25 May 2019 (UTC)\nI think the key to writing a neutral article about any person in the news is to begin with mainstream sources, by which I mean the network news channels and major broadsheets. For CBS for example you can do a search for \"tulsi gabbard\" and sort it by date, more or less.[13] Then you summarize what the articles say in proportion to the coverage they give. While media have their own biases, it is the standard that we follow.\nThe alternative is to put in whatever information we think is important. The problem is that different editors will find different things important. Typically that leads to long discussion threads, edit-warring and use of content boards and RfCs, even ANI and AE requests.\nTFD (talk) 03:48, 26 May 2019 (UTC)\nSure, we can begin with major media sources, but that is not where we end.  You have not provided any evidence that coverage of the Daily Beast story should be given no weight in this article.  Seven RS report on this story.  Like I asked above in #Daily Beast & NBC hit pieces, how does the coverage of this story compare to other stories about her campaign? Kolya Butternut (talk) 09:19, 10 June 2019 (UTC)\n\nFox Business News story\n\"Gabbard has scheduled a June fundraiser with Wall Street executives.\" This was reported only in Fox Business News, although it was retweeted by Ana Kasparian of TYT and commented on in alternative media. As it turns out, the story was misleading. I will remove it and suggest we keep it out unless it because a campaign issue reported in mainstream media. TFD (talk) 03:46, 10 June 2019 (UTC)\n\n@The Four Deuces: I added the content a few weeks ago. Where is your reliable source for \"the story was misleading\"? I don't care at all about tweets.- MrX 🖋 18:58, 13 June 2019 (UTC)\nTwo weeks ago you wrote, \"Fox News being the most watched cable news station merely confirms that The Masses Are Asses[14]....we are not here to repeat obvious falsehoods on behalf of the most watched news station. The way around it is to not use the trashy source[15]....Fox News has shown us that they cannot be relied on for accuracy, or truthfulness.\"[16] Can you explain why you would use it as a source?\nThe Fox article calls the breakfast \"a fundraiser sponsored by Wall Street executives...according to an invitation reviewed by FOX Business.\" But the invitation says nothing about fundraising. And the term \"Wall Street executives\" is misleading. Wall Street is defined in Webster's as \"the influential financial interests of the U.S. economy.\"[17] Farvahar Partners which happens to be located on Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan is not a major financial institution. And why not quantify the number of executives (there are only two partners at Favahar)? The problem is that once the story is properly reported, it has no more significance than any of the other meetings Gabbard holds every day.\nTFD (talk) 19:59, 13 June 2019 (UTC)\nI added the Fox Business News-sourced content to this article before commenting about the Fox News-sourced content that you cited. My comment on May 28 reflects the revelation (to me) that Fox News could be so blatant with their misreporting. Until that point, I cited Fox News pretty much without reservation.\nThe Fox Business News article says \"In recent weeks, Gabbard has been meeting with financial types to raise money for her campaign, and has scheduled a fundraiser sponsored by Wall Street executives to take place the first week in June, according to an invitation reviewed by FOX Business.\". Your link to thecoreclub.com does not disprove that at all. If anything, it bolsters Fox News' reporting. You do realize that a Wall Street executive does not literally have to be located on Wall Street, right? Mr. Malik sure seems to be a Wall Street executive according to his bio.[18] If you dispute that the \"breakfast\" is not fundraising, I'm afraid your disagreement is with Fox Business News (212-601-7000). I suppose you think Mr. Malik just decided to share some hash browns and eggs with Mrs. Gabbard for the fun of it, or to throw Fox News off the scent? Sure.\nIf we are going to be so selective about what to include in this article, then there's little reason to keep a separate article and we should just fold it back into Tulsi Gabbard. Without capturing the little reporting being done on this candidate, there's almost nothing that is not already covered or could easily be covered in the main article. I think this material adds to the understanding of the subject and should be restored.- MrX 🖋 20:56, 13 June 2019 (UTC)\nThe link I provided is the source that Fox used. As I mentioned the invitation does not say the purpose of the meeting is to raise money, but is included as part of CORE:'s cultural programming: \"CORE: produces over 200 thoughtfully curated events every year, exposing our members to emerging trends in the media, the arts, cuisine, travel, commerce, and thought. By fostering shared transformative experiences, the programming at CORE: enriches the intellectual and social lives of its individual members.\"\nI didn't say that Wall Street meant the actual street necessarily, but that it referred to major financial institutions, or at least that is what most readers would think. Institutions such as Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Bank of America that paid Hillary Clinton.\nIt may be that there are insufficient sources to write a neutral article about the campaign.\nTFD (talk) 21:41, 13 June 2019 (UTC)\nWebster's defines a fundraiser as \"a social event (such as a cocktail party) held for the purpose of raising funds.\"[19] Here is a link to an invitation to what the media described as a fundraiser for Joe Biden.[20] Note that attendees were required to contribute $2,800 in order to attend. But when Biden met with voters in a restaurant and did not charge for attendance, it was called a \"meet and greet.\"[21] TFD (talk) 15:29, 14 June 2019 (UTC)\n\nTulsi Gabbard wins [unscientific] polls after first debate\nFrom a quick glance, this doesn't appear to have been added.  petrarchan47คุก 19:58, 27 June 2019 (UTC)\n\nAP/Haaretz: \"Google searches during the debate, a popular metric to gauge interest in candidates, showed Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard peaked the most interest during the debate\"\n\n*: \"By the end of the debate, Gabbard had clinched 40 percent of Google searches in the U.S., compared to Sen.

I'm sorry, but I have no idea how to respond to it.- MrX 🖋 12:04, 24 June 2019 (UTC)\nThe NBC article says, \"Several experts who track websites and social media linked to the Kremlin have also seen what they believe may be the first stirrings of an upcoming Russian campaign of support for Gabbard.\" That Russian channels ran positive stories about Gabbard is a fact, that they \"support\" her is an opinion.\nIt is not helpful when editors cite WP:RANDOMPOLICIES without explaining their relevance. WP:ALLEGED in fact says, \"alleged and accused are appropriate when wrongdoing is asserted but undetermined.\" WP:NPOV says, \"Avoid stating opinions as facts.\" No idea what relevance WP:NOR has.\nAlso, and it is supported in policy, when accusations are made against people, the source and weight of those accusations. should be stated. Your approach reminds me of Fox News Channel, where hosts will use weasel-wording, such as \"some say Obama was born in Kenya.\" Their highly partisan viewers then interpret this as \"Obama was born in Kenya.\" And I and a number of other editors spent a lot of time arguing with editors who were convinced Obama was not really the U.S. president.\nTFD (talk) 19:46, 21 June 2019 (UTC)\nThe article says a lot of things. In the lede, it says:\nThe Russian propaganda machine that tried to influence the 2016 U.S. election is now promoting the presidential aspirations of a controversial Hawaii Democrat who earlier this month declared her intention to run for president in 2020.— [22]\nIt then goes on to say that the experts believe it \"may be the first stirrings of an upcoming Russian campaign of support for Gabbard.\" So we have NBC making a statement of fact, and supporting it by citing experts. The very next paragraph that begins \"since Gabbard announced...\" explains NBC's synthesis. The word alleged or its equivalent is no where in the article, so its use is indeed OR, but more specifically WP:WEASEL and editorializing. Editorializing is a form of introducing an editor's POV into what should be an NPOV article.\nThere is no accusation against a person, unless you consider the Russian Propaganda Machine a person. No crime has been committed. Unless you can point out in the source where the equivalent of \"alleged\" appears, I intend to remove this from the article.

Adam Johnson in Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting for example in his article, \"Washington Post Ran 16 Negative Stories on Bernie Sanders in 16 Hours\", lists all sixteen articles and provides links. And note that although the article mentions Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post it does not say \"Bezos propaganda machine attacks Sanders\" presumably because the author does not want to make unfounded accusations. TFD (talk) 14:44, 24 June 2019 (UTC)\nYou need to put the various statements in context. The first three paragraphs read:\nThe Russian propaganda machine that tried to influence the 2016 U.S. election is now promoting the presidential aspirations of a controversial Hawaii Democrat who earlier this month declared her intention to run for president in 2020.\nAn NBC News analysis of the main English-language news sites employed by Russia in its 2016 election meddling shows Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who is set to make her formal announcement Saturday, has become a favorite of the sites Moscow used when it interfered in 2016.\nSeveral experts who track websites and social media linked to the Kremlin have also seen what they believe may be the first stirrings of an upcoming Russian campaign of support for Gabbard.\nIt's presented as a finding not a fact. Whether or not the Kremlin propaganda machine is promoting her is a matter of opinion, unless we have evidence of discussions by the KGB.\nIn an RfC on whether the article on the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign should mention that the father of the Orlando murderer supported her (a story separately reported in the New York Times, CNN, The Guardian and many other news media), you wrote, \"This embarrassing incident received a brief burst of coverage after it happened and then quickly faded from interest. It would violate WP:NPOV to include this because it has not enjoyed sustained media coverage; it's only tangentially relevant to the campaign; and it would tend to unfairly associate the campaign and the candidate with a mass murderer.\" (19:34, 28 August 2016) Obviously you understand that associated a campaign with a criminal act - however tangentially - reflects on the candidate, which takes it into BLP. Also, I would be interested if you could explain how the \"brief burst of coverage rule\" applies to Clinton, but not Gabbard.\nTFD (talk) 13:59, 24 June 2019 (UTC)\n\"Russia propaganda machine is now promoting\". That is a declared fact in NBC's voice.\nYour comparison of a story about Russian news coverage of a candidate to a story about a mass murderer's father is absurd. Let's leave other stuff out of this. First, I don't think this makes Gabbard look bad at all. Maybe it makes the Russian state media look bad, but it is not criminal. They can publish as many news stories as they like about anyone without breaking any laws. I've said it before: there is very little coverage in the news about Gabbard's campaign. She's just not rising to the top. That's why this episode stands out as noteworthy. Now can we get back to the word \"allege\". Did you insert it because you don't think any of this material should be included at all? - MrX 🖋 14:19, 24 June 2019 (UTC)\nYou have not answered my question. What is the difference between saying Clinton was supported by a murderer's father and Gabbard was supported by the Russia propaganda machine? TFD (talk) 14:54, 24 June 2019 (UTC)\nActually, I did. One is a murder and the other is a news story. That's the difference. Also, we're not talking about Clinton any more. Please let it go.- MrX 🖋 21:19, 25 June 2019 (UTC)\ns you are aware, a number of Russians have been indicted for interfering in the U.S. election. TFD (talk) 23:44, 25 June 2019 (UTC)\nThat has nothing to do with this. Surely you must know that.- MrX 🖋 00:11, 26 June 2019 (UTC)\nYes, I am well aware that the indictments were for the 2016 presidential election campaign not the current one. And could you please point to the policy that says allegations of foreign support in an election should be mentioned, while support from a murderer should not be. TFD (talk) 00:34, 26 June 2019 (UTC)\nNo, I'm not going to go backwards in time to re-litigate content debates about Hillary Clinton's bio that I don't even remember. If you are against including this material in any form, I wish you would just state it plainly, rather than deflecting any attempt to reach a compromise on wording that satisfies NPOV like we did at Tulsi Gabbard. - MrX 🖋 00:51, 26 June 2019 (UTC)\nI am not against including it in any form, just against misrepresenting sources. That is particularly important in a BLP. TFD (talk) 01:12, 26 June 2019 (UTC)\nThis edit is not supported by the source. The was an experiment, not a false flag operation agains a republican. Also, it was not done by the firm; it was done by the CEO of the firm. - MrX 🖋 20:35, 27 June 2019 (UTC)\n\nWhy would you say the article says the opposite of what it does?  Both articles cite an internal company report saying: \"“We orchestrated an elaborate ‘false flag’ operation that planted the idea that the Moore campaign was amplified on social media by a Russian botnet[.]”  The NYT adds: Mr. Morgan said in an interview that the Russian botnet ruse “does not ring a bell,” adding that others had worked on the effort and had written the report.  Please self-revert in the face of this evidence or provide evidence of your claim.🌿   SashiRolls  t ·   c 05:04, 28 June 2019 (UTC)\nFunny you omitted a quote a few lines further down: “The research project was intended to help us understand how these kind of campaigns operated,” said Mr. Morgan. “We thought it was useful to work in the context of a real election but design it to have almost no impact.” So no, I don't think your attempt to rewrite history is going to stick. If you change it back to your version, I will revert you. --Calton | Talk 06:07, 28 June 2019 (UTC)\nDon't be silly:  the guy said the report about the \"false flag operation\" that his company wrote \"didn't ring a bell\" and then says that what he didn't even know about was supposed to \"have [had] almost no effect\"...   Also, the NYT article does not mention Tulsi Gabbard, obviously, since the first propaganda campaign was conducted and written up before NBC decided (unwisely IMO) to consult with them.\nI think it's pretty clear to anyone reading that I am not the one making an \"attempt to rewrite history\" here, so please cut out the personal attacks / aspersions.  TLDR;  The text is currently massaged to be misleading.  I will be changing it, if MrX does not do so now that it has been demonstrated that both articles say nearly word for word what I wrote (and we should really be basing ourselves on the article which is actually about Gabbard).  🌿   SashiRolls  t ·   c 09:59, 28 June 2019 (UTC)\nI recommend that you don't force your preferred edit into the article, when several other editors have consented to the wording currently in the article:\nGreenwald also criticized NBC's use of the cybersecurity firm as an expert source, because its CEO participated in an experiment that emulated Russian troll accounts.\nThe New York Times wrote:\nHeadline: Secret Experiment in Alabama Senate Race Imitated Russian TacticsAn internal report on the Alabama effort, obtained by The New York Times, says explicitly that it “experimented with many of the tactics now understood to have influenced the 2016 elections.”“The research project was intended to help us understand how these kind of campaigns operated,” said Mr. Morgan. “We thought it was useful to work in the context of a real election but design it to have almost no impact.”\nGreenwald opined:\nThe New York Times, when exposing the scam, quoted a New Knowledge report that boasted of its fabrications: “We orchestrated an elaborate ‘false flag’ operation that planted the idea that the [Roy] Moore campaign was amplified on social media by a Russian botnet.'”That fraud was overseen by New Knowledge’s CEO,\nGreenwald was simply not objective in his reporting. We can't use similar language in this encyclopedia article.- MrX 🖋 11:53, 28 June 2019 (UTC)\nI don't disagree that Greenwald used strong language (scam, fraud).  As you know I did not use either word but referred to the false flag operation mentioned by the company itself, quoted in the NYT & the Intercept.  Other than your pal Calton I haven't seen support for the text not taken from the article about Gabbard.  🌿   SashiRolls  t ·   c 12:02, 28 June 2019 (UTC)\nYou (and Greenwald) conveniently left out that was an experiment and you embellished by adding \"against a republican candidate.\" - MrX 🖋 12:49, 28 June 2019 (UTC)\nThe NYT article does not mention Gabbard and is included only as a contextual service to the readers.  You are wrong to say that I embellished by adding \"against a Republican candidate\", but you know that, as the second sentence of the NYT article says:  The secret project, carried out on Facebook and Twitter, was likely too small to have a significant effect on the race, in which the Democratic candidate it was designed to help, Doug Jones, edged out the Republican, Roy Moore.  Please stop casting aspersions which are easily disproven (come to think of it just stop casting them altogether...) It is unlikely that the smear directed at Tulsi is likely to affect the race (unless a lot of people get fed up with the manipulations on every platform, as may well have happened in 2016).🌿   SashiRolls  t ·   c 15:46, 28 June 2019 (UTC)\nI'm not sure you understand what casting aspersions means. Here's an example for you.- MrX 🖋 16:05, 28 June 2019 (UTC)\nYour comment above has nothing to do with this page, where we should strive to have exceptionally high quality sourcing for claims such as those you've made (wasn't it you who I had to call out for talking about a quid pro quo going on concerning TG earlier on this page and on her BLP?)  If you have something to say about a comment on JimboTalk or FramTalk or Community Health Initiative or WP:HARASSMENT, feel free to make it there.  Here I'd appreciate that you don't change the subject when you're out of reasoned argument. For info asperger (at least in French) means to spray (whether pesticide or invective). So yes, unfounded accusations of \"embellishment\" are kind of not much more than foaming at the mouth, especially when they are so easily shown not to be fact-based. So, you've said that I misrepresented the source, I provided evidence showing that I was not, then you said I was embellishing on the source, I provided evidence showing that was false too... do you have any other objections to the faithful reporting of what sources say?  Because at the end of the day, that seems to be the problem. I want to faithfully represent the sources...   🌿   SashiRolls  t ·   c 19:33, 28 June 2019 (UTC)\nThe solution is to quote or paraphrase what Greenwald said, rather than argue about whether his characterization was fair. Greewald distrusts New Knowledge because they spread misleading information in order to influence an election, according to at least one reliable sources.[23] Perhaps Greenawald is wrong to suppose that this was reason to believe they are unreliable, but it is his opinion. TFD (talk) 19:20, 28 June 2019 (UTC)\nThanks, TFD.  I've incorporated your focus on opinion into the compromise edit, which also represents the New Knowledge claim that they engage in digital experimentation. 🌿   SashiRolls  t ·   c 19:52, 28 June 2019 (UTC)\nTFD, we're not obligated to print his misinformation. He can wrap it in opinion and tie it with a bow, but when it's obvious that he has embellished the facts, we should defer to the Gray Lady. - MrX 🖋 20:39, 28 June 2019 (UTC)\nI think you should appreciate that different people see things differently without necessarily being wrong. Not every opinion that digresses from the party line at ThinkProgress should be rejected on that basis. TFD (talk) 22:30, 28 June 2019 (UTC)\n\n\"silence debate and dissent\"\n@Nblund, next one — re this edit. The full quote this comes from is: \n\n“Our freedoms and democracy are being threatened by media giants ruled by corporate interests who are in the pocket of the establishment war machine,” she said. “When journalism is deployed as a weapon against those who call for peace, it threatens our democracy as it seeks to silence debate and dissent, creates an atmosphere of fear and paranoia, and stokes the rhetoric that could lead to nuclear war.”[24]\nI'm ok w most of your edits, but think her point re \"to silence debate and dissent\" should be included along with the \"stokes the rhetoric that could lead to nuclear war\". Humanengr (talk) 04:37, 27 August 2019 (UTC)\n@Nblund: Are you ok w that? Humanengr (talk) 14:43, 27 August 2019 (UTC)\n\nSorry, I missed the earlier ping. I'm not strongly opposed here, but I think the \"silencing debate and dissent\" stuff has more to do with her views on the media rather than her views on foreign policy issues. I won't object if you really think that's essential, but I liked your previous suggestion (related to other content) of including a full quote in a footnote while paraphrasing in the text. Nblund talk 15:45, 27 August 2019 (UTC)\nTo explain — this is another aspect of the foreign-domestic coupling; it is silencing debate and dissent -about- foreign intervention per the boldface:\n“Our freedoms and democracy are being threatened by media giants ruled by corporate interests who are in the pocket of the establishment war machine,” she said. “When journalism is deployed as a weapon against those who call for peace, it threatens our democracy as it seeks to silence debate and dissent, creates an atmosphere of fear and paranoia, and stokes the rhetoric that could lead to nuclear war.”[25]\nEdited and also put quote in fn. Humanengr (talk) 20:45, 27 August 2019 (UTC)\n\nto add (after condensation) from her PR\npublished by Politico:\n“… only four of the DNC’s list of sixteen qualifying polling organizations - Monmouth, Fox, Quinnipiac and CNN/SRSS - have released any new polls following the second July 30-31 Democratic presidential debate in Detroit.  \n\n In the two weeks after the first Democratic primary debate in Miami, the period between June 28 and July 13, six DNC-certified polls were released.\n After the second debate in Detroit, when Rep. Gabbard had one of the strongest performances on the stage, only two certified polls were released in the two weeks following her break-out appearance in the second debate.\n\n No major news source released a national poll in the two week period following the second debate, compared to five polls released by seven major news organizations after the first debate. For example, CNN released DNC-certified polls on a regular monthly basis since March until after the Detroit debate (which CNN co-hosted) when they inexplicably stopped releasing polls. \n Following the first debate in Miami, eleven of the DNC’s qualified polling organizations released numbers, and four of these organizations released multiple polls. This contrasts starkly with the almost dormant activity of these same polling organizations following the second debate.  \n The delayed release of polls so long after the debates is particularly harmful to candidates with lower name-recognition. Delayed poll releases are an advantage for high-name recognition candidates such as Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris.”\n\nHumanengr (talk) 23:12, 31 August 2019 (UTC)\n\nI definitely don't think we can include stuff directly based on her press releases.  Nblund talk 01:52, 1 September 2019 (UTC)\nIt's not presented for the truth of the matter. So, yes, it can be included as Politico is a professional organization that published it as a claim made by the Gabbard campaign. Humanengr (talk) 02:23, 1 September 2019 (UTC)\nBut Politico just repeated the press release. It's not a matter of the number of links in the chain. A press release from the Gabbard campaign is still just a press release from the Gabbard campaign no matter who decided to reprint it. It's a question of WP:DUE weight. Nblund talk 02:29, 1 September 2019 (UTC)\nIt’s not links in a chain for the truth of the matter — which I would agree with you on — but only for validation that the campaign made the statement. Humanengr (talk) 03:51, 1 September 2019 (UTC)\nBut its a question of WP:DUE weight. This poses the same problem that is posed by taking stuff from her website. If secondary sources  aren't covering it, then it probably isn't worthy of inclusion. Nblund talk 12:00, 1 September 2019 (UTC)\nWhat we have is a 2ary source which has, in fact, covered publication of and therefore validated the original source. That validation is not contested and is all it is being cited for. That suffices to include a statement that \"the campaign said x\". As for the claims themselves, they are verifiable — which I have now accomplished. Humanengr (talk) 20:28, 1 September 2019 (UTC)\nI would remove the paragraph beginning \"Realclearpolitics columnist Michael Tracey argued....\" It's not specific to Gabbard and belongs in the Debates article. TFD (talk) 20:05, 1 September 2019 (UTC)\nI'm open to that idea, but Tracey is mostly framing his complaints in terms of the perceived unfairness to Gabbard. Nblund talk 20:24, 1 September 2019 (UTC)\nThx, @Nblund — I hadn't seen the updated coverage of the press release. All seems resolved. Humanengr (talk) 20:21, 2 September 2019 (UTC)\n\nAll of these changes seem to be mostly one sided. It's understandable that we would give a bit more coverage of Gabbard's response here than we might at a general page on the DNC debates, but we're heading toward a one-sided WP:QUOTEFARM.  Nblund talk 22:11, 2 September 2019 (UTC)\nWhat you call \"quote\" is in the first part of my edit the explanation of the DNC's polling ruleset as written by Vox. I could not find a better, more concise way to describe these rules as Vox did. Please feel free to rephrase (maybe reorder sentences?) it if you worry about copyright. The second part is a link to the list of Gabbard's 24 non-qualifying polls above 2%. If you can find another link to that list of polls, please replace it. I have not found another list except combing through Wikipedia's own poll list. Xenagoras (talk) 23:55, 2 September 2019 (UTC)\nSorry, I think I was a little vague there. I linked a series of diffs, and most of it wasn't stuff you added. That said, there was some copy pasting here. We need to restate stuff in our own words. It can be a fine line, but there were several passages where there are more that 10 words in a row that are identical to the source. Nblund talk 00:13, 3 September 2019 (UTC)\nRegarding this edit: the problem is that the placement of the quote gives the impression that Wikipedia is taking sides. The implication is that DNC should have changed their polling criteria in the run-up to the third debate. Tracey and Gabbard make that argument, but Wikipedia doesn't need to make it for them. Nblund talk 00:25, 3 September 2019 (UTC)\nI'm unclear how the placement of the quotes creates a problem. Do you imply that not having the statement in full quote is making it unclear that it is an exact DNC quote? I began the sentence with as much attribution as appropriate to indicate that the following statement is a DNC quote. Please make a proposal on how to change the quotes for that DNC statement. Would you prefer a full quote? I avoided a full quote because firstly it's easier to find the begin and end of shorter quotes, secondly I use quotes only for judgmental phrases (like newspapers do), and thirdly because you seem to be keen on the copyright issue (although I don't know if the DNC's ruleset may be copied freely from their website). The DNC's 2018 announcement is important to know because it invalidates the claim of several others (e.g. Vox) who say that changing the polling rules during the debate cycle would be inappropriate because of \"interference\". The DNC foresaw a possibly upcoming requirement to change the rules during the process and stated this publicly. We are not arguing on behalf on Gabbard or Tracey, but stating the facts / quoting the DNC. If a full quote makes it better, so be it. Xenagoras (talk) 01:17, 3 September 2019 (UTC)\nThe DNC's 2018 announcement is important to know because it invalidates the claim of several others (e.g. Vox) who say that changing the polling rules during the debate cycle would be inappropriate because of \"interference\". This is the problem. The length of the quote doesn't really matter, the problem is that you're trying to arrange things in a way that advances your own interpretation of the situation. WP:NPOV doesn't allow this.  Nblund talk 01:23, 3 September 2019 (UTC)\nPrefacing it with “The Gabbard campaign reminded the DNC that …” or some such should resolve this. Humanengr (talk) 02:18, 3 September 2019 (UTC)\nDid the Gabbard campaign do that? The source was the RCP op-ed. The goal is to document the dispute, not persuade readers of who is right. We can say \"the Gabbard campaign complained\" and provide some specifics, but we don't need to transcribe their views onto this page. Nblund talk 14:21, 3 September 2019 (UTC)\nThe DNC “Given the fluid nature…” text from their framework was quoted in both the RCP commentary and the Gabbard campaign press release (para 7). RCP followed the quote with “Now would likely be an ‘appropriate’ time for such a reassessment.”; the press release followed with “The Gabbard campaign is calling on the DNC to hold true to their promise and make adjustments to the process now to ensure transparency and fairness.“ Humanengr (talk) 15:15, 3 September 2019 (UTC)\nOkay, but the other problem still remains. We're dedicating an excessive amount of space to the Gabbard campaign's characterization of the issue. Surely we can get the main idea across without beating readers over the head with every argument the campaign made.  Nblund talk 15:31, 3 September 2019 (UTC)\nWill try to look at later today.Humanengr (talk) 15:42, 3 September 2019 (UTC)\nNblund, the Gabbard campaign did quote the DNC in their press release (also quoted by Politico): \"In a 2018 memo laying out their proposed framework for the debates, the DNC wrote, “Given the fluid nature of the presidential nominating process, the DNC will continuously assess the state of the race and make adjustments to this process as appropriate.” The Gabbard campaign is calling on the DNC to hold true to their promise and make adjustments to the process now to ensure transparency and fairness.\"\nAdding facts to an article is never a WP:NPOV problem, because WP:NPOV applies only to views = opinions, but not to facts. The source is not an op-ed, but the DNC's statement on their debate qualification process. Do you really want to suggest that readers cannot recognize the quotation marks encapsulating the DNC's text in Tracey's op-ed? You once threw the  WP:LINKSINACHAIN at me to justify your removal of sources from an article, and now I hand it back at you: WP:LINKSINACHAIN defines that the text you dispute is sourced by the DNC, stating a fact about the DNC's rules and intentions because it is exactly and completely quoting the relevant text from the DNC.\nWP:WIKIVOICE requests to avoid stating facts as opinions. Uncontested ... factual assertions made by reliable sources should normally be directly stated in Wikipedia's voice. (It is uncontested that the article text you dispute is a written statement by the DNC about the qualification rules and intent of the DNC.) WP:BESTSOURCES states, good and unbiased research, based upon the best and most reputable authoritative sources available, helps prevent NPOV disagreements. WP:PRIMARYNOTBAD states that sometimes, a primary source is even the best possible source, such as when you are supporting a direct quotation. In such cases, the original document is the best source because the original document will be free of any errors or misquotations introduced by subsequent sources.\nSince Rupar disagrees with Tracey and Gabbard on whether changing the DNC's qualification rules is good (promised by DNC) or bad (interference), the best source is the original text of the DNC about their own intent for changing their qualification rules. Therefore, a full quote of the relevant text in the DNC source is a correct edit to make, but it can also be said in WP:WIKIVOICE since it is undisputed fact.\nBesides that, Rupar writes, \"the true “interference” would have been changing the rules late in the process.\" The DNC refutes that by stating, \"Given the fluid nature of the presidential nominating process, the DNC will continuously assess the state of the race and make adjustments to this process as appropriate, and always transparently.\" This DNC statement does not imply that the DNC wants to or should make exactly the adjustments that Gabbard or Tracey propose. This DNC statement only refutes Rupar's claim that \"changing the rules late in the process would be interference.\" This is exactly what I wrote previously.  I am not \"trying to arrange things in a way that advances\" my \"own interpretation of the situation\", but I am adding important facts. If you prefer, we can explicitly or implicitly state that this DNC statement does not imply or endorse the explicit wishes of Tracey or Gabbard. We could alternatively include the Gabbard campaign statement quoting and reminding the DNC to stay true to their written promise given in 2018.\nHiding the facts about the situation between Tracey/Gabbard and Rupar so that the WP:POV of Rupar seems to be balanced to the WP:POV of Tracey/Gabbard is not the purpose of Wikipedia. Facts always have priority over opinions. The DNC's \"side\" - the \"side\" of the facts - has not been mentioned yet. You are trying to delete facts from articles via spurious usage of Wikipedia policy like WP:NPOV and WP:LINKSINACHAIN (and others) which you apply only when it furthers your WP:POV but don't apply when it goes against your WP:POV. Your POV is visible where you write, \"The problem is that the placement of the quote gives the impression that Wikipedia is taking sides. The implication is that DNC should have changed their polling criteria in the run-up to the third debate. Tracey and Gabbard make that argument, but Wikipedia doesn't need to make it for them.\" You recognize that the DNC statement refutes Rupar's view but you insist on hiding this but pushing the POV that Wikipedia must not present facts that refute Rupar's view. Xenagoras (talk) 20:07, 3 September 2019 (UTC)\nXenagoras: please stop posting walls of text. We've already established that WP:DUE applies to facts, and editing Wikipedia with the goal of trying to \"refute\" one side and advance another is obviously not neutral. Nblund talk 20:48, 3 September 2019 (UTC)\nNblund, abide the Wiki policies and we don't have to discuss at all. Read the policies before you lean on them. I do not want to quote Wiki policies, but this is unfortunately necessary, because you always keep cyclically coming back at me with another non sequitur Wiki policy. Therefore I have here pre-emptively refuted all comebacks you might possibly have brought in all these cycles. But you again brought another unexpected non sequitur. WP:DUE does not apply to facts as we established there (search text in project page: \"21:44, 29 August 2019\"). WP:NOTEVERYTHING applies to facts. I am not editing Wikipedia with the goal of \"refuting one side\". I add facts, prioritized by importance. You want to suppress facts, therefore I explained why these facts are important to include in the article. This whole discussion was easily avoidable if you had abode the Wiki policies and not deleted perfectly appropriate content. Stop using non sequiturs and I don't have to refute you by quoting the policy text. And stop attempting to justify your deletions by naming non applicable policies.  Xenagoras (talk) 22:45, 3 September 2019 (UTC)\nAgain: cite whatever policy you'd like, but its abundantly clear that saying \"this information is factual\" is not a justification for inclusion. You justified the edit by saying that \"This DNC statement only refutes Rupar's claim...\". That's not what we do here. Nblund talk 22:56, 3 September 2019 (UTC)\nI rearranged a shortened a bit in the first part; and added for context in the latter (forgot to note the last of that in the edit summary). Humanengr (talk) 23:20, 3 September 2019 (UTC)\nNblund, I only cite the policy that applies best in the given context. You are right that stating \"this information is factual\" alone is not a justification for inclusion of a fact. Inclusion is warranted if the fact has enough enduring importance. The debates segment currently contains the opinions on the \"changeability\" of the DNC's rules from Rupar, Tracey and Gabbard, but zero facts from the DNC itself about this issue. Therefore the importance threshold for adding facts is currently very low because facts always have priority over opinions. Xenagoras (talk) 01:16, 4 September 2019 (UTC)\n\nDefamation suit\nSashiRolls, the citation lists one lawyer who argued that Gabbard's lawsuit was legitimate.

        "content": "Olaudah Equiano (; c. 1745 – 31 March 1797), known for most of his life as Gustavus Vassa (), was a writer and abolitionist. According to his memoir, he was from the village of Essaka in modern southern Nigeria.  Enslaved as a child in West Africa, he was shipped to the Caribbean and sold to a Royal Navy officer. He was sold twice more before purchasing his freedom in 1766.\nAs a freedman in London, Equiano supported the British abolitionist movement, in the 1780s becoming one of its leading figures. Equiano was part of the abolitionist group the Sons of Africa, whose members were Africans living in Britain. His 1789 autobiography, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, sold so well that nine editions were published during his life and helped secure passage of the British Slave Trade Act 1807, which abolished the slave trade. The Interesting Narrative gained renewed popularity among scholars in the late 20th century and remains a useful primary source.\n\nEarly life and enslavement\nAccording to his memoir, Equiano was born around 1745 in the Igbo village of Essaka in what is now southern Nigeria. He claimed his home was part of the Kingdom of Benin.\nEquiano recounted an incident of an attempted kidnapping of children in his Igbo village, which was foiled by adults. When he was around the age of eleven, he and his sister were left alone to look after their family premises, as was common when adults went out of the house to work. They were kidnapped and taken far from their home, separated and sold to slave traders. He tried to escape but was thwarted. After his owners changed several times, Equiano happened to meet with his sister but they were separated again. Six or seven months after he had been kidnapped, he arrived at the coast where he was taken on board a European slave ship. He was transported with 244 other enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to Barbados in the British West Indies. He and a few other slaves were sent on for sale in the Colony of Virginia.\nLiterary scholar Vincent Carretta argued in his 2005 biography of Equiano that the activist could have been born in colonial South Carolina rather than Africa, based on a 1759 parish baptismal record that lists Equiano's place of birth as Carolina and a 1773 ship's muster that indicates South Carolina. Carretta's conclusion is disputed by other scholars who believe the weight of evidence supports Equiano's account of coming from Africa.\nIn Virginia, Equiano was bought by Michael Henry Pascal, a lieutenant in the Royal Navy. Pascal renamed the boy \"Gustavus Vassa\", after the 16th-century King of Sweden Gustav Vasa who began the Protestant Reformation in Sweden. Equiano had already been renamed twice: he was called Michael while on board the slave ship that brought him to the Americas, and Jacob by his first owner. This time, Equiano refused and told his new owner that he would prefer to be called Jacob. His refusal, he says, \"gained me many a cuff\" and eventually he submitted to the new name.: 62  He used this name for the rest of his life, including on all official records; he only used Equiano in his autobiography.\nPascal took Equiano with him when he returned to England and had him accompany him as a valet during the Seven Years' War with France (1756–1763). Equiano gives witness reports of the Siege of Louisbourg (1758), the Battle of Lagos (1759) and the Capture of Belle Île (1761). Also trained in seamanship, Equiano was expected to assist the ship's crew in times of battle; his duty was to haul gunpowder to the gun decks. Pascal favoured Equiano and sent him to his sister-in-law in Great Britain so that he could attend school and learn to read and write.\nEquiano converted to Christianity and was baptised at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 9 February 1759, when he was described in the parish register as \"a Black, born in Carolina, 12 years old\". His godparents were Mary Guerin and her brother, Maynard, who were cousins of his master Pascal. They had taken an interest in him and helped him to learn English. Later, when Equiano's origins were questioned after his book was published, the Guerins testified to his lack of English when he first came to London.\nIn December 1762, Pascal sold Equiano to Captain James Doran of the Charming Sally at Gravesend, from where he was transported back to the Caribbean, to Montserrat, in the Leeward Islands. There, he was sold to Robert King, an American Quaker merchant from Philadelphia who traded in the Caribbean.\n\nRelease\nRobert King set Equiano to work on his shipping routes and in his stores. In 1765, when Equiano was about 20 years old, King promised that for his purchase price of 40 pounds (equivalent to £6,900 in 2023) he could buy his freedom. King taught him to read and write more fluently, guided him along the path of religion, and allowed Equiano to engage in profitable trading for his own account, as well as on his owner's behalf. Equiano sold fruits, glass tumblers and other items between Georgia and the Caribbean islands. King allowed Equiano to buy his freedom, which he achieved in 1766. The merchant urged Equiano to stay on as a business partner. However, Equiano found it dangerous and limiting to remain in the British colonies as a freedman. While loading a ship in Georgia, he was almost kidnapped back into enslavement.\n\nFreedom\nBy about 1768, Equiano had gone to Britain. He continued to work at sea, travelling sometimes as a deckhand based in England. In 1773 on the Royal Navy ship HMS Racehorse, he travelled to the Arctic in an expedition towards the North Pole. On that voyage he worked with Dr Charles Irving, who had developed a process to distill seawater and later made a fortune from it. Two years later, Irving recruited Equiano for a project on the Mosquito Coast in Central America, where he was to use his African background to help select slaves and manage them as labourers on sugar-cane plantations. Irving and Equiano had a working relationship and friendship for more than a decade, but the plantation venture failed. Equiano met with George, the \"Musquito king's son\".\nEquiano left the Mosquito Coast in 1776 and arrived at Plymouth, England, on 7 January 1777.\n\nPioneer of the abolitionist cause\nEquiano settled in London, where in the 1780s he became involved in the abolitionist movement. The movement to end the slave trade had been particularly strong among Quakers, but the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade was founded in 1787 as a non-denominational group, with Anglican members, in an attempt to influence parliament directly. Under the Test Act, only those prepared to receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper according to the rites of the Church of England were permitted to serve as MPs. Equiano had been influenced by George Whitefield's evangelism.\nAs early as 1783, Equiano informed abolitionists such as Granville Sharp about the slave trade; that year he was the first to tell Sharp about the Zong massacre, which was being tried in London as litigation for insurance claims. It became a cause célèbre for the abolitionist movement and contributed to its growth.\nOn 21 October 1785 he was one of eight delegates from Africans in America to present an 'Address of Thanks' to the Quakers at a meeting in Gracechurch Street, London. The address referred to A Caution to Great Britain and her Colonies by Anthony Benezet, founder of the Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage.\nEquiano was befriended and supported by abolitionists, many of whom encouraged him to write and publish his life story. He was supported financially in this effort by philanthropic abolitionists and religious benefactors. His lectures and preparation for the book were promoted by, among others, Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon.\n\nMemoir\nEntitled The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African (1789), the book went through nine editions in his lifetime. It is one of the earliest-known examples of published writing by an African writer to be widely read in England. By 1792, it was a best seller and had been published in Russia, Germany, Holland and the United States. It was the first influential slave narrative of what became a large literary genre. But Equiano's experience in slavery was quite different from that of most slaves; he did not participate in field work, he served his owners personally and went to sea, was taught to read and write, and worked in trading.\nEquiano's personal account of slavery, his journey of advancement, and his experiences as a black immigrant caused a sensation on publication. The book fuelled a growing anti-slavery movement in Great Britain, Europe and the New World. His account surprised many with the quality of its imagery, description and literary style.\nIn his account, Equiano gives details about his hometown and the laws and customs of the Eboe people. After being captured as a boy, he described communities he passed through as a captive on his way to the coast. His biography details his voyage on a slave ship and the brutality of slavery in the colonies of the West Indies, Virginia and Georgia.\nEquiano commented on the reduced rights that freed people of colour had in these same places, and they also faced risks of kidnapping and enslavement. Equiano embraced Christianity at the age of 14 and its importance to him is a recurring theme in his autobiography. He was baptised into the Church of England in 1759; he described himself in his autobiography as a \"protestant of the church of England\" but also flirted with Methodism.\nSeveral events in Equiano's life led him to question his faith. He was distressed in 1774 by the kidnapping of his friend, a black cook named John Annis, who was taken forcibly off the British ship Anglicania on which they were both serving. His friend's kidnapper, William Kirkpatrick, did not abide by the decision in the Somersett Case (1772), that slaves could not be taken from England without their permission, as common law did not support the institution in England & Wales. Kirkpatrick had Annis transported to Saint Kitts, where he was punished severely and worked as a plantation labourer until he died. With the aid of Granville Sharp, Equiano tried to get Annis released before he was shipped from England but was unsuccessful. He heard that Annis was not free from suffering until he died in slavery. Despite his questioning, he affirms his faith in Christianity, as seen in the penultimate sentence of his work that quotes the prophet Micah (Micah 6:8): \"After all, what makes any event important, unless by its observation we become better and wiser, and learn 'to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly before God?'\"\nIn his account, Equiano also told of his settling in London. He married an English woman and lived with her in Soham, Cambridgeshire, where they had two daughters. He became a leading abolitionist in the 1780s, lecturing in numerous cities against the slave trade. Equiano records his and Granville Sharp's central roles in the anti-slave trade movement, and their effort to publicise the Zong massacre, which became known in 1783.\nReviewers have found that his book demonstrated the full and complex humanity of Africans as much as the inhumanity of slavery. The book was considered an exemplary work of English literature by a new African author. Equiano did so well in sales that he achieved independence from his benefactors. He travelled throughout England, Scotland and Ireland promoting the book, spending eight months in Ireland alone between 1792-3. He worked to improve economic, social and educational conditions in Africa. Specifically, he became involved in working in Sierra Leone, a colony founded in 1792 for freed slaves by Britain in West Africa.\n\nLater years, radical connections\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Britain had recruited black people to fight with it by offering freedom to those who left rebel masters. In practice, it also freed women and children, and attracted thousands of slaves to its lines in New York City, which it occupied, and in the South, where its troops occupied Charleston, South Carolina. When British troops were evacuated at the end of the war, their officers also evacuated these former American slaves. They were resettled in the Caribbean, in Nova Scotia, in Sierra Leone in Africa, and in London. Britain refused to return the slaves, which the United States sought in peace negotiations.\nIn 1783, following the United States' gaining independence, Equiano became involved in helping the Black Poor of London, who were mostly those former African-American slaves freed during and after the American Revolution by the British. There were also some freed slaves from the Caribbean, and some who had been brought by their owners to England and freed later after the decision that Britain had no basis in common law for slavery. The black community numbered about 20,000. After the Revolution some 3,000 former slaves had been transported from New York to Nova Scotia, where they became known as Black Loyalists, among other Loyalists also resettled there. Many of the freedmen found it difficult to make new lives in London or Canada.\nEquiano was appointed \"Commissary of Provisions and Stores for the Black Poor going to Sierra Leone\" in November 1786. This was an expedition to resettle London's Black Poor in Freetown, a new British colony founded on the west coast of Africa, in present-day Sierra Leone. The blacks from London were joined by more than 1,200 Black Loyalists who chose to leave Nova Scotia. They were aided by John Clarkson, younger brother of abolitionist Thomas Clarkson. Jamaican maroons, as well as slaves liberated from illegal slave-trading ships after Britain abolished the slave trade, also settled at Freetown in the early decades. Equiano was dismissed from the new settlement after protesting against financial mismanagement and he returned to London.\nEquiano was a prominent figure in London and often served as a spokesman for the black community. He was one of the leading members of the Sons of Africa, a small abolitionist group composed of free Africans in London. They were closely allied with the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. Equiano's comments on issues were published in newspapers such as the Public Advertiser and the Morning Chronicle. He replied to James Tobin in 1788, in the Public Advertiser, attacking two of his pamphlets and a related book from 1786 by Gordon Turnbull. Equiano had more of a public voice than most Africans or Black Loyalists and he seized various opportunities to use it.\nEquiano was an active member of the radical working-class London Corresponding Society, which campaigned for democratic reform.  In 1791–92, touring the British Isles with his autobiography and drawing on abolitionist networks he brokered connections for the LCS, including what may have been the Society's first contacts with the United Irishmen. In Belfast, where his appearance in May 1791 was celebrated by abolitionists who five years previously had defeated plans to commission vessels in the port for the Middle Passage, Equiano was hosted by the leading United Irishman, publisher of their Painite newspaper the Northern Star, Samuel Neilson. Following the onset of war with revolutionary France, leading members of the LCS, including Thomas Hardy with whom Equiano lodged in 1792, were charged with treason, and in 1799, following evidence of communication between leading members and the insurrectionary United Irishmen, the society was suppressed.\n\nMarriage and family\nOn 7 April 1792, Equiano married Susannah Cullen, a local woman, in St Andrew's Church, Soham, Cambridgeshire. The original marriage register containing the entry for Vassa and Cullen is held today by the Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies. He included his marriage in every edition of his autobiography from 1792 onwards. The couple settled in the area and had two daughters, Anna Maria (1793–1797) and Joanna (1795–1857) who were baptised at Soham church.\nSusannah died in February 1796, aged 34, and Equiano died a year after that on 31 March 1797. Soon after, Anna died at the age of four, leaving Joanna to inherit Equiano's estate when she was 21; it was then valued at £950 (equivalent to £92,000 in 2023). Anna Maria is commemorated by a plaque at St Andrew's Church, Chesterton, Cambridge. Joanna Vassa married the Reverend Henry Bromley, a Congregationalist minister, in 1821. They are both buried at the non-denominational Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington, London; the Bromleys' monument is now a Grade II listed building.\n\nLast days and will\nHe drew up his will on 28 May 1796. At the time he was living at the Plaisterers' Hall, then on Addle Street, in Aldermanbury in the City of London. He moved to John Street (now Whitfield Street), close to Whitefield's Tabernacle, Tottenham Court Road. At his death on 31 March 1797, he was living in Paddington Street, Westminster. Equiano's death was reported in American as well as British newspapers.\nEquiano was buried at Whitefield's Tabernacle on 6 April. The entry in the register reads \"Gustus Vasa, 52 years, St Mary Le bone\". His burial place has been lost. The small burial ground lay either side of the chapel and is now Whitfield Gardens. The site of the chapel is now the American International Church.\nEquiano's will, in the event of his daughters' deaths before reaching the age of 21, bequeathed half his wealth to the Sierra Leone Company for a school in Sierra Leone, and half to the London Missionary Society.\n\nControversy related to memoir\nFollowing publication in 1967 of a newly edited version of his memoir by Paul Edwards, interest in Equiano revived. Scholars from Nigeria have also begun studying him.  For example, S.S. Ogede identifies Equiano as a pioneer in asserting \"the dignity of African life in the white society of his time\".\nIn researching his life, some scholars since the late 20th century have disputed Equiano's account of his origins. In 1999 while editing a new version of Equiano's memoir, Vincent Carretta, a professor of English at the University of Maryland, found two records that led him to question the former slave's account of being born in Africa. He first published his findings in the journal Slavery and Abolition. At a 2003 conference in England, Carretta defended himself against Nigerian academics, like Obiwu, who accused him of \"pseudo-detective work\" and indulging \"in vast publicity gamesmanship\". In his 2005 biography, Carretta suggested that Equiano may have been born in South Carolina rather than Africa, as he was twice recorded from there. Carretta wrote:\n\nEquiano was certainly African by descent. The circumstantial evidence that Equiano was also African-American by birth and African-British by choice is compelling but not absolutely conclusive. Although the circumstantial evidence is not equivalent to proof, anyone dealing with Equiano's life and art must consider it.\nAccording to Carretta, Equiano/Vassa's baptismal record and a naval muster roll document him as from South Carolina. Carretta interpreted these anomalies as possible evidence that Equiano had made up the account of his African origins, and adopted material from others. But Paul Lovejoy, Alexander X. Byrd and Douglas Chambers note how many general and specific details Carretta can document from sources that related to the slave trade in the 1750s as described by Equiano, including the voyages from Africa to Virginia, sale to Pascal in 1754, and others. They conclude he was more likely telling what he understood as fact, rather than creating a fictional account; his work is shaped as an autobiography.\nLovejoy wrote that:\n\ncircumstantial evidence indicates that he was born where he said he was, and that, in fact, The Interesting Narrative is reasonably accurate in its details, although, of course, subject to the same criticisms of selectivity and self-interested distortion that characterize the genre of autobiography.\nLovejoy uses the name of Vassa in his article, since that was what the man used throughout his life, in \"his baptism, his naval records, marriage certificate and will\". He emphasises that Vassa only used his African name in his autobiography.\nOther historians also argue that the fact that many parts of Equiano's account can be proven lends weight to accepting his account of African birth. As historian Adam Hochschild has written:\n\nIn the long and fascinating history of autobiographies that distort or exaggerate the truth. ... Seldom is one crucial portion of a memoir totally fabricated and the remainder scrupulously accurate; among autobiographers ... both dissemblers and truth-tellers tend to be consistent.\nHe also noted that \"since the 'rediscovery' of Vassa's account in the 1960s, scholars have valued it as the most extensive account of an eighteenth-century slave's life and the difficult passage from slavery to freedom\".\n\nLegacy\nThe Equiano Society was formed in London in November 1996. Its main objective is to publicise and celebrate the life and work of Olaudah Equiano.\nIn 1789 Equiano moved to 10 Union Street (now 73 Riding House Street). A City of Westminster commemorative green plaque was unveiled there on 11 October 2000 as part of Black History Month. Student musicians from Trinity College of Music played a fanfare composed by Professor Ian Hall for the unveiling.\nEquiano is honoured in the Church of England and remembered in its Calendar of saints with a Lesser Festival on 30 July, along with Thomas Clarkson and William Wilberforce who worked for abolition of the slave trade and slavery.\nIn 2007, the year of the celebration in Britain of the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade, Equiano's life and achievements were included in the National Curriculum, together with William Wilberforce. In December 2012 The Daily Mail claimed that both would be dropped from the curriculum, a claim which itself became subject to controversy. In January 2013 Operation Black Vote launched a petition to request Education Secretary Michael Gove to keep both Equiano and Mary Seacole in the National Curriculum. American Rev. Jesse Jackson and others wrote a letter to The Times protesting against the mooted removal of both figures from the National Curriculum.\nA statue of Equiano, made by pupils of Edmund Waller School, was erected in Telegraph Hill Lower Park, New Cross, London, in 2008.\nThe head of Equiano is included in Martin Bond's 1997 sculpture Wall of the Ancestors in Deptford, London\nAuthor Ann Cameron adapted Equiano's autobiography for children, leaving most of the text in Equiano's own words; the book was published in 1995 in the U.S. by Random House as The Kidnapped Prince: The Life of Olaudah Equiano, with an introduction by historian Henry Louis Gates Jr.\nOn 16 October 2017, Google Doodle honoured Equiano by celebrating the 272nd year since his birth.\nA crater on Mercury was named \"Equiano\" in 1976.\nThe exoplanet HD 43197 b was officially named Equiano in 2019 as part of NameExoWorlds.\nIn 2019, Google Cloud named a subsea cable running from Portugal through the West Coast of Africa and terminating in South Africa after Equiano.\nIn 2022, the city of Cambridge honoured Equiano by renaming Riverside Bridge to Equiano Bridge.\n\nRepresentation in other media\nThe Gambian actor Louis Mahoney played Equiano in the BBC television mini-series The Fight Against Slavery (1975).\nA 28-minute documentary, Son of Africa: The Slave Narrative of Olaudah Equiano (1996), produced by the BBC and directed by Alrick Riley, uses dramatic reconstruction, archival material and interviews to provide the social and economic context for his life and the slave trade.\nNumerous works about Equiano have been produced for and since the 2007 bicentenary of Britain's abolition of the slave trade:\n\nEquiano was portrayed by the Senegalese musician Youssou N'Dour in the film Amazing Grace (2006).\nAfrican Snow (2007), a play by Murray Watts, takes place in the mind of John Newton, a captain in the slave trade who later became an Anglican cleric and hymnwriter. It was first produced at the York Theatre Royal as a co-production with Riding Lights Theatre Company, transferring to the Trafalgar Studios in London's West End and a national tour. Newton was played by Roger Alborough and Equiano by Israel Oyelumade.\nKent historian Dr Robert Hume wrote a children's book entitled Equiano: The Slave with the Loud Voice (2007), illustrated by Cheryl Ives.\nDavid and Jessica Oyelowo appeared as Olaudah and his wife in Grace Unshackled – The Olaudah Equiano Story (2007), a radio adaptation of Equiano's autobiography, created by Focus on the Family Radio Theatre.\nThe British jazz artist Soweto Kinch's first album, Conversations with the Unseen (2003), contains a track entitled \"Equiano's Tears\".\nEquiano was portrayed by Jeffery Kissoon in Margaret Busby's 2007 play An African Cargo, staged at London's Greenwich Theatre.\nEquiano is portrayed by Danny Sapani in the BBC series Garrow's Law (2010).\nThe Nigerian writer Chika Unigwe has written a fictional memoir of Equiano: The Black Messiah, originally published in Dutch: De zwarte messias (2013).\nIn Jason Young's 2007 short animated film, The Interesting Narrative of Olaudah Equiano, Chris Rochester portrayed Equiano.\nA TikTok series under the account @equiano.stories recounts \"the true story of Olaudah Equiano\", a collection of episodes reimagining the childhood of Equiano.

        "content": "Margaret Macpherson Grant (27 April 1834 – 14 April 1877) was a Scottish heiress and philanthropist. Born in Aberlour parish to a local surgeon, she was educated in Hampshire, and was left an only child when her elder brother died in India in 1852. Two years later, she inherited a large fortune from her uncle, Alexander Grant, an Aberlour-born planter and merchant who had become rich in Jamaica.\nMacpherson Grant took up residence in Aberlour House, which had been built for her uncle by William Robertson. She lived unconventionally for a woman of her time, dressing in a manner one newspaper called \"manly\", and entering into what was described as a form of marriage with a female companion, Charlotte Temple, whom she had met in London in 1864. Macpherson Grant donated generously to charitable enterprises, especially those associated with the Scottish Episcopal Church, establishing an orphanage (now the Aberlour Child Care Trust) and founding St Margaret's Episcopal Church in Aberlour. She drank heavily, and despite attempts by friends and family members to persuade her to stop, she always relapsed into alcoholism.\nShe made several wills over the course of her life that would have left her estate to Temple but, shortly after Temple left her to marry a man, Macpherson Grant revoked her will; she died intestate five months later aged forty-two. Her disinherited former companion sued, and the court determined that the bulk of her fortune should go to cousins, who were most likely unknown to her.\n\nEarly life and family\nMargaret Macpherson Grant's parents, Annie (née Grant) and Alexander Macpherson, lived in Garbity, Aberlour parish, Banffshire. Her father was a local surgeon in Aberlour, Moray, and her mother, who was from the influential Grant family, was thought to have married beneath her station. The Macphersons married on 30 April 1825, and had their first child, Alexander Grant Macpherson, in 1828; Margaret Macpherson Grant (originally called Margaret Gordon Macpherson) was born on 27 April 1834. While she was in her teens, Macpherson Grant attended school in Hampstead, in north London, studying with Mary Ann Stodart, a writer and activist for women's education. Her brother travelled to India, where he died in 1852, leaving Macpherson Grant as her parents' only surviving child.\nMacpherson Grant's uncle on her mother's side was Alexander Grant. Originally from Drumfurrich Farm in Aberlour parish, he had travelled to Jamaica, where he amassed a considerable fortune as a planter and merchant. He was a slave owner, and a member of the Jamaican legislature. It is not certain when he returned to Britain, but it is thought that he was in London by the 1820s, and he visited Aberlour in 1829 to attend to the burial of his father, the farmer George Grant. When slavery was abolished in 1833, Grant benefitted from a government scheme to compensate slave owners, claiming over £24,000 for the loss of his slaves and other business assets. He commissioned the architect William Robertson to build Aberlour House for him, which was completed in 1838. He also had plans to buy the farm on which he was born. Aberlour House became his official residence, although it is doubtful that he ever actually lived there, and he was still engaged in business in London as a West Indies merchant.\nAlexander Grant had been involved in business in Jamaica with Alexander Donaldson and Alexander Thomson. As the three men were absentee landlords, affairs on their estates were managed by a team of local attorneys in Kingston, with help from the bookkeepers and overseers who lived on the plantations. This arrangement created issues in settling the debts of their estates after Donaldson's death in 1807, and Thomson's in 1818, resulting in years of litigation among the heirs. Because the ongoing revenues from the estates were inadequate to satisfy the debts and accruing interest, Grant pressed for the plantations to be sold. The trustees in Jamaica, John Meek and Joseph Green, resisted these efforts and ignored orders to sell issued by the High Court of Chancery. The lawsuits would not be fully resolved until 1861, by which time Alexander Grant had died, and his estates had come into the possession of Macpherson Grant.\n\nAdult life\nInheritance\nWhen Alexander Grant died in 1854, Macpherson Grant, then twenty years old, inherited the bulk of his wealth, along with Aberlour House and his estates in Scotland and Jamaica, valued in total at £300,000. He also left her an outright settlement of £20,500 payable at his death provided she had attained a majority of twenty years of age, an annuity of £1,500, and several pieces of jewellery and personal property. Amongst the Jamaican plantations in the inheritance were Brampton Bryan, Bryan Castle, Fairfield, Low Layton, Orange River, Orange Vale, and interests in the estates of Nonsuch and Unity. As with all agricultural concerns, the output of the estates varied with changes in economic conditions. When Orange Vale was first established in 1780, its main source of income was its coffee crop, supplemented by selling or hiring out its slave labourers until 1813. After 1850, the main crop shifted from coffee to raising and marketing cattle. By 1856, the estate was selling pimento and lime, which were produced until 1863. By the time Macpherson Grant inherited the plantation, it was economically failing, and the sale of cattle had become its principal means of generating revenue.\nAlexander Grant's will stipulated that he wished Macpherson Grant to take the Grant name. Her father therefore applied on her behalf for royal approval for her to add Grant to her own name, and for her to use the combined arms of the Grant and Macpherson families; consent was given in June 1854. She moved into Aberlour House and immediately started improving and extending the building. To do so, she employed A. & W. Reid, Robertson's nephews, who had continued his practice in Elgin after Robertson's death in 1841. They added bay windows to some of the rooms, expanded the service quarters to make space for a new ballroom, and built a porte-cochère at the principal entrance. Macpherson Grant spent her time salmon fishing and travelling, leaving the management of her Jamaican estates to her agents, Milne & Co in Elgin. She also made a will leaving all her wealth to the Scottish Episcopal Church, of which she was a supporter.\n\nWith Charlotte Temple\nWhile on a trip to London in 1864, Macpherson Grant became friends with Charlotte Temple, the twenty-two-year-old daughter of William Temple, a landowner and former High Sheriff of Wiltshire. Later that year, Temple visited Macpherson Grant in Aberlour and stayed until the spring of 1865. Some weeks after Temple had left, Macpherson Grant returned to London, and the pair renewed their friendship; Macpherson Grant also became acquainted with Temple's social circle. Soon after, Macpherson Grant asked Temple's parents to allow their daughter to live permanently with her at Aberlour, and in return promised to make Temple the heir to her estate. Her parents were reluctant, but eventually agreed. Macpherson Grant went immediately to her solicitors in London, and drew up a new will, instructing that her estate should not go, as she had previously wished, to the Episcopal Church, but to her own children (should she have had any); should she die without issue, her estate would be bequeathed to an elderly aunt named Margaret Gordon, and if the latter had died it would go to Temple. She then joined Temple, who had been waiting in a carriage outside the solicitor's office, and presented her with a pen, saying \"Do you know what I have been doing? I have been making you my heir, and here is the pen I did it with; keep it!\"\nMacpherson Grant and Temple returned to live in Aberlour House, and spent their time engaging in field sports and breeding livestock. Newspapers carried stories of their shooting expeditions and livestock entries at agricultural shows. Macpherson Grant promoted and supported several charitable causes, especially those involving the church. Her relationship with Temple was described in an account of their affair, published in 1882 in The History of the Province of Moray, as being much like a marriage: Macpherson Grant placed a ring upon the ring finger of Temple's left hand, and Temple referred to herself as 'wifie' in letters to Macpherson Grant. This lifestyle was unusual for the time, and was described as \"remarkable tomfoolery\" in the local press. Newspapers of the time also commented on Macpherson Grant's \"strong-minded nature\" and described her as \"very masculine in appearance and manly in dress\". According to the historian Rachel Lang, the scale of her wealth, and of her charitable donations, afforded her \"considerable social leeway\" and allowed her to be accepted into society.\nMacpherson Grant relied heavily on alcohol during the late 1860s. She went through periods of abstinence only to relapse. Temple encouraged her to stop, and tried to prevent any public scandal being caused by her drinking. Macpherson Grant's father also tried to persuade her to reduce her intake; she temporarily stopped drinking when he moved into Aberlour House in 1870, but resumed after he died in April 1871. Following his death, and since her aunt Margaret Gordon had died in 1866, Macpherson Grant thought it necessary to reorganise her affairs. On 31 May 1872, she had her London solicitors prepare a new will, leaving her estate to her own children (again, only if she had had any at the time of her death); if she had no children, her estate was to go to Temple and Temple's heirs. Her Scottish solicitors warned her they were unconvinced that this English document would satisfy the requirements of Scots law. Distressed by the prospect that her will might be contested, she instructed her solicitors to communicate with each other and come to an arrangement that would put the matter beyond question. On 8 March 1873, Gibson-Craig & Co produced another will, leaving the whole of her estate in trust, with a provision that Temple inherit it, or be paid a legacy of £20,000 in the event that any children of Macpherson Grant should contest the settlement. Macpherson Grant also gave instructions that her inheritor should become the bearer of the name and arms of Grant of Aberlour.\n\nPhilanthropy\nMacpherson Grant continued to fund enterprises of the Episcopal Church. She provided the organ for Inverness Cathedral, which was built between 1866 and 1869 by the architect Alexander Ross, and in 1874 she persuaded Canon Charles Jupp to come to Aberlour to act as her personal chaplain with the promise to build an orphanage with a church and school. The orphanage was founded in 1875, under Jupp's administration. It initially operated out of a cottage until new buildings were completed. Alexander Ross was engaged to design the orphanage and its chapel, later known as St Margaret's Church, and work on these started in 1875.\n\nTemple's marriage\nAt some point in 1875 Harry Farr Yeatman, a retired commander of the Royal Navy, visited Aberlour. It is not known exactly when he arrived, but in August of that year there was a report in the London Standard about his success in shooting on Macpherson Grant's land. The following December, he and Temple became engaged. Macpherson Grant's response to this betrothal was mixed: at times, she seemed positive, and offered to host the wedding at Aberlour House; but she also showed distress at the prospect of Temple leaving her. On 11 December 1875, Macpherson Grant had to be rescued from a fire at Aberlour House, the cause of which was never established. She became increasingly confused – sometimes believing she had rescued her servant from the blaze, while at other times thinking she had sustained a head injury.\nOn 8 February 1876 Yeatman and Temple were married at St Peter's Church, Eaton Square, in London. Shortly before the marriage, Temple had written to Simon Keir, a partner of Macpherson Grant's agents at Milne & Co, requesting that his accounting of sales no longer be sent to Macpherson Grant directly, but rather to Macpherson Grant's Edinburgh solicitor, Mr Falconer. Unhappy with this new arrangement, and with what he saw as Temple's interfering in his affairs, Keir drew up a deed of revocation, which would cancel Macpherson Grant's existing wills. In November 1876 he visited Aberlour, and Macpherson Grant signed the deed, thereby revoking any claim that Temple, now Yeatman, had on her estate. With Temple now gone, Macpherson Grant was depressed, heavily dependent upon alcohol and, according to Rachel Lang, going through a \"psychotic episode\". She died on 14 April 1877, after suffering a partial paralysis. Her death occurred before the completion of the orphanage and church and two weeks before her forty-third birthday. She was interred in the Aberlour church yard in a burial aisle she had erected for her parents' graves.\n\nLegacy\nSince she had signed the deed of revocation, but had not written a new will, Macpherson Grant died intestate. Her trustee, Mr Falconer, determined that the estate should go to cousins on her father's side of the family: James Proctor, of Tarland, Margaret Proctor, of Banchory, and Alex Proctor, of Rhynie. A case ensued at the Second Division of the Court of Session, wherein the Yeatmans' solicitor, Mr Fraser, argued that Macpherson Grant had been coerced by Keir into signing the deed of revocation, because he was aware of her declining health, and the estate should go to Yeatman as previously agreed. He further argued that it was highly improbable Macpherson Grant would have wanted it to go to the Proctors. Not only had she probably never met them, they were from her father's family; her fortune had been amassed by her maternal uncle who had never thought well of her father. After Fraser made his initial statement, counsels for both parties retired to discuss the case in private. Following more than an hour of negotiation, they returned to court, and the Lord Advocate, who was presiding in the case, announced that they had agreed terms. The estate was to pass to the Proctors, and Yeatman was to receive a settlement of £10,000. She was also entitled to receive a gold watch and a diamond brooch that had belonged to Macpherson Grant, the value of which was to be deducted from the settlement. An 1882 account of the court case noted that the closure denied the public \"the full revelation of a curious, an interesting, and instructive romance\".\n\nLater events\nThe Yeatmans relocated to Dorset, and had a son, also called Harry Farr Yeatman, who was killed in 1917, aged 37, in the First World War. He is commemorated by a memorial at St Barnabas Church in Sturminster Newton in Dorset.\nWilliam Grant (1809–1877), another member of the Grant family and the son of James William Grant of Wester Elchies, paid for the continued construction of the orphanage, and its chapel, St Margaret's Church. He died in 1877, leaving a legacy of £8,000 to cover the cost of their completion. St Margaret's Church was completed by 23 November 1879. The church was extended and improved in the following decades, has been designated a Category A listed building, and is still used as an active place of worship. The orphanage grew to become the second largest children's home in Scotland, continuing to operate until 1967. The building has since been demolished, leaving only the clocktower in a memorial garden near the church. The charity that managed the orphanage continues to operate as the Aberlour Child Care Trust.\nThe Proctors, unable to afford the expense of maintaining the estate, sold it to John Ritchie Findlay, the proprietor of The Scotsman newspaper. Findlay expanded his land holdings in the area and was considered to be a benevolent landlord who worked to better the living conditions of his tenant farmers. He died at the estate in 1898. Walkers Shortbread restored Aberlour House to use as their head office.\n\nNotes\nCitations\n\n\n== Sources =="

        "content": "Tranmere Rovers Football Club is a professional association football club based in Birkenhead, Merseyside, England. The team competes in EFL League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system.\nFounded in 1884 as Belmont Football Club, they adopted their current name in 1885. Tranmere's regular kit is an all-white strip with blue, or occasionally blue and green trim which have been their main colours since 1962. The club moved to its current home, Prenton Park, in 1912. In 1995, the ground had a major redevelopment in response to the Taylor Report. It now seats 16,567 in four stands: the Main Stand, the Kop, the Johnny King Stand and the Cowshed.\nTranmere played in regional leagues until they were invited to become a founder member of Football League Third Division North in 1921. They finished as champions for the 1937–38 season, though were relegated out of the Second Division the following year. They dropped into the Fourth Division in 1961, before winning promotion back to the third tier at the end of the 1966–67 season. Relegation in 1975 was followed by an immediate promotion in 1975–76 under the stewardship of manager John King, and this time they survived for just three seasons in the third tier until being relegated once again in 1979. During the 1980s, they were beset by financial problems and, in 1987, went into administration. However John King returned to manage the club for a second spell and guided Rovers to promotion in 1988–89, which they followed up by winning the Associate Members' Cup in 1990 and then promotion out of the play-offs in 1991.\nThe 1990s would prove to be the most successful period in the club's history as Tranmere remained in the second tier, and came close to reaching the Premier League with three consecutive play-off campaigns at the start of the decade. Under King's successor, John Aldridge, Tranmere experienced a number of cup runs, most notably reaching the 2000 League Cup final. They were finally relegated in 2001 and then spent 13 seasons in the third tier, before back-to-back relegations saw them drop out of the Football League after an 94-year stay. Tranmere spent three seasons in the National League and then returned to the third tier of the Football League via successive play-off campaigns in 2018 and 2019. They were demoted from League One in 2020 after clubs voted to end the season early due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHistory\nFormative years\nTranmere Rovers were, initially, formed as Belmont Football Club when the football arms of two cricket clubs – Lyndhurst Wanderers and Belmont – came together in 1884. On 15 November 1884, they won their first game 4–0 against Brunswick Rovers. This was a friendly match, as there were no leagues until 1888. Under the presidency of James McGaul, the team had a successful inaugural season, losing only one of their fifteen matches. An unrelated, disbanded side had played under the name \"Tranmere Rovers Cricket Club (Association football section)\" in 1881–82. On 16 September 1885, before their second season began, Belmont F.C. adopted this name Tranmere Rovers. Tranmere is historically a large village that was subsumed within the later expansion of the town of Birkenhead.\nTranmere played their first matches at Steeles Field in Birkenhead. In 1887, they bought Ravenshaws Field from Tranmere Rugby Club. In 1895, their ground was renamed Prenton Park, although it was 25 years later that the team moved into the current stadium of the same name. Tranmere first wore a kit of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks. In 1889 they adopted orange and maroon shirts, but in 1904 returned to wearing their original kit.\nIn 1886, Tranmere entered their first competition: the Liverpool and District Challenge Cup; in 1889, they entered the West Lancashire League. They joined the Combination, a much stronger league, in 1897, and won the championship in 1908. In 1910, continuing their movement through the leagues, they entered the Lancashire Combination and in 1912 they showed their ambition by moving to the present Prenton Park site, with an 800-seat stand. Tranmere won the Lancashire Combination Championship in 1914, and Stan Rowlands became the first Tranmere player to receive an international cap when he was selected to play for Wales.\nRovers continued to play throughout the First World War, although their players were criticised for avoiding military service, despite being employed in the local shipyards.\n\nInter-war years\nFollowing the expulsion of Leeds City Reserves in 1919, Tranmere were able to enter the Central League. Their timing was excellent as the following season, four Central League clubs – including Tranmere – were invited to join the new Division Three North. On 27 August 1921, as founder members of the division, they won their first Football League match 4–1 against Crewe Alexandra at Prenton Park. At this time the team were managed by Bert Cooke, who did so for 23 years in total, the club record for longest serving manager.\nIn 1924, local boy Dixie Dean made his debut aged 16 years 355 days. He played 30 games for Rovers, scoring 27 goals, before being transferred to Everton for £3,000. In the 1927–28 season, Dean scored a record 60 League goals for Everton. After Dean's departure, several talented young players also left for Division One clubs, leading to Cooke's reputation as a shrewd businessman. Among those sold was Pongo Waring who – having scored six goals in the 11–1 victory over Durham City – went to Aston Villa for £4,700. As of 2010, Waring retains the record of scoring most goals for Villa in a single season.\nIn 1934, an FA Cup tie between Rovers and Liverpool was watched at Anfield by 61,036 fans, then a record crowd for a game involving Rovers. One year later, Bunny Bell netted 57 goals during the 1933–34 season, and nine goals in the 13–4 Boxing Day 1935 victory over Oldham Athletic. As of 2011, the aggregate of 17 goals in one game remained a league record.\nDuring this same period, Tranmere made several appearances in the Welsh Cup, reaching the final on two occasions. In 1934, they lost 3–0 to Bristol City in a replay, after a 1–1 draw. The following season, they went one better by beating local rivals Chester 1–0 to win their first silverware since joining the Football League.\nRovers won their first championship in the Football League in 1938, with victory in Division Three North, and, hence, promotion to Division Two for the first time. It is still Rovers's only championship in the Football League. However, they were relegated the next season, winning six matches – the record for the worst performance of any team in Division Two.\n\nCreation of the Superwhites\nPrenton Park emerged from the Second World War largely unscathed. Tranmere rejoined the peacetime Football League in Division Three North, and stayed there until the 1958 restructuring of the football league's lower divisions. Manager Peter Farrell led Tranmere to finish 11th in the final season of the Northern Section, securing a place in the new national Division Three, where they were, again, founder members. The final match against Wrexham, also fighting for a place in the higher league, attracted a crowd of 19,615, which, as of 2010, remained the highest ever attendance at a Prenton Park league match.\nIn 1961, Tranmere's inspirational captain Harold Bell left the club. Bell had been picked in the first game after the Second World War in the 1946 season, and did not miss a match until he was dropped on 30 August 1955, a total of 459 consecutive appearances for a British team, a record which held until 2011. Rovers certainly missed their captain, and were relegated to Division Four for the first time in 1961.\n\nThe club brought in Dave Russell as manager, and Russell made some changes. Tranmere had worn a kit of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks since 1904 – the same colours as local rivals, Division One club Everton. Russell introduced an all-white strip to set the teams apart; these have been Tranmere's usual colours since. Russell also developed a successful youth policy which included England international Roy McFarland among its graduates. Russell guided Rovers back to Division Three in 1967, a year before a new 4,000-seater main stand was opened, and Rovers reached the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time. Three years later the club's record attendance at Prenton Park was established as 24,424 supporters witnessed Rovers draw 2–2 with Stoke City in the FA Cup.\nIn 1972, Ron Yeats was installed as player-manager. He strengthened Tranmere's connections with local rivals Liverpool by recruiting several former teammates such as Ian St John, and bringing in Bill Shankly in a consultancy role. This team saw one of the most memorable Rovers results of all time when, in a League Cup tie in 1973, Tranmere beat First Division Arsenal 1–0 at their former Highbury home. However, Tranmere returned to the Fourth Division in 1975. The following decade was among the bleakest times in the club's history, with the team usually in the lower reaches of the Fourth Division, beset by financial problems, and attaining crowds of less than 2,000.\nIn 1979, Steve Mungall joined Tranmere from Motherwell. He went on to make more than 500 league appearances for Rovers in a 17-year period. This spell saw Rovers rise up the league and make several appearances at Wembley. He remained with the club, on the coaching staff, until October 2000, when he left to pursue business interests.\n\nAnother relegation to Division Four in 1979 put the club in financial difficulties. Debts mounted throughout the 1980s, with insolvency forestalled through a series of friendly fixtures, contributions from fans and a £200,000 loan from Wirral Council. This partnership proved an enduring one, as Wirral's logo still appeared on the shirts until 2011. In July 1984, the club was sold to a Californian attorney, making Tranmere one of the first English clubs to be bought by a foreign owner. Nonetheless, in 1987, the club went into administration.\n\nJohnny King era\nLocal businessman Peter Johnson took over control and ownership. This proved to be a turning point in Tranmere's history, the club under his ownership experiencing by far the most successful period in its history, in which manager John King took the team from the bottom of Division Four to the brink of English football's top league. King's first task was to avoid the team finishing bottom of Division Four, which would have resulted in their relegation from the football league. Safety was guaranteed in the last game of the season, with a 1–0 home win over Exeter City on the last day of the season.\nThe first full season (1987–88) of King's second managerial spell in charge saw Tranmere make their first appearance at Wembley Stadium, when a good mid-season run of form saw them qualify for the Football League Centenary Tournament. Tranmere defeated Division One clubs Wimbledon and Newcastle United, before losing on penalties to eventual winner Nottingham Forest. The following season, King guided Tranmere to promotion as Division Four runner-up. Their final game played to secure promotion was against Crewe Alexandra, with both teams needing a point to gain promotion. The first half was contested as usual, but, in the second half, with the score at 1–1, neither team targeted the goal of the other, leading to combined celebrations when the game had concluded. Earlier that season, they had won several games in the League Cup, including against Division One Middlesbrough, in between wins against fellow Division Four club Stockport County and Division 3 club Blackpool, ultimately losing to Bristol City of Division 3.\nAt the end their first season in Division Three, Tranmere almost secured promotion to Division 2, losing 2–0 in the play-off final to Notts County, a week after Tranmere's 2–1 victory over Bristol Rovers at Wembley Stadium in the final of the Leyland DAF Trophy had secured the club's first trophy. The form of striker Ian Muir was key to Tranmere's success during this period. He joined the club in 1985, and scored 180 goals in eleven seasons. He became the club's record scorer, and, in 2012, the first inductee to their hall of fame. Fellow hall of fame member John Morrissey joined the club in 1986. The winger spent 14 seasons at the club, making 585 appearances.\n\nIn the 1990–91 season, Tranmere won promotion to Division Two for the first time since the 1930s, with a 1–0 play-off win over local rivals Bolton Wanderers. Once again, Rovers made an appearance in the Leyland DAF Trophy final, this time losing 3–2 to Birmingham City. This made the play-off victory over Bolton Wanderers Tranmere's fourth appearance in a Wembley Stadium final in just over a year.\nIn summer 1991, former Liverpool player John Aldridge joined Tranmere Rovers, signing from Spanish club Real Sociedad for a fee of £250,000; he would remain on the club's payroll for the next 10 years, scoring 170 times to put him behind only Ian Muir in the all-time scoring charts. Aldridge also received 30 caps for the Republic of Ireland, and was the first Tranmere player to score at a World Cup. In 1993, Scotland international Pat Nevin joined the team, forming a four-man attack alongside Aldridge, Malkin and Morrissey. In three successive seasons, Tranmere reached the play-off semi-finals, missing out on promotion to the newly formed Premier League through defeat to Swindon Town in 1993, Leicester City in 1994, and Reading in 1995. 1994 also saw Tranmere progress to the League Cup semi-final, where they faced Aston Villa over two legs. The home leg was won 3–1 by Tranmere, with Villa scoring their only goal in the 94th minute. The score in the away leg was 2–1 in favour of Villa until the 88th minute when Villa scored again to win the game 3–1, so the match went to extra-time and penalties. With Tranmere one kick away from the final, Mark Bosnich saved Liam O'Brien's sudden death penalty, and Tranmere eventually lost 5–4.\nA reconstructed Prenton Park was opened in March 1995, with the all-seater stadium then holding just under 17,000 supporters. In April 1996, with Rovers struggling for form in the league, chairman Frank Corfe appointed John Aldridge as player-manager, and King was \"moved upstairs\" to become Director of football. They finished the 1995–96 campaign in 13th position.\n\n2000 and beyond\nIn the 1999–2000 season, despite severe financial constraints, victories over two Premiership sides (West Ham United, Sunderland, followed by First Division club Fulham) led, not only to a place in the sixth round of the FA Cup, but also, to a place in the 2000 Football League Cup final against Leicester City – the first time in the club's history that Rovers had reached a major final. Matt Elliott scored Leicester's opening goal, before Tranmere's Clint Hill was sent off for a second bookable offence. Despite being reduced to ten men, David Kelly equalised; however, Elliot scored Leicester's second goal three minutes later, and Tranmere lost the match 2–1. This was the last League Cup game held at the original Wembley stadium.\nIn 2000, the all-white kit was reintroduced and is still used in 2014. That season, Tranmere Rovers had another cup competition run, beating local Premier League rival Everton 3–0 at Goodison Park, then Southampton 4–3 (after being 0–3 down), before exiting after a loss to another local rival, Premier League club Liverpool. However, Tranmere Rovers struggled during league matches that season; Aldridge quit as manager before Tranmere's relegation to Division Two ended a spell of ten years in Division One.\n\nThe club hired Brian Little as manager in 2003. He took Rovers to a play-off semi-final in 2004–05, and a best ever 6th round replay in the 2004 FA Cup, where they lost to eventual finalists, Millwall. At the end of the 2005–06 season, Little left the club and was replaced by former player Ronnie Moore. In Moore's three seasons in charge, the club finished 9th, 11th and 7th, narrowly missing out on qualification for in the play-offs in his final season. Moore was sacked in 2009, with former England winger John Barnes, whose only previous domestic managerial experience was with Celtic 10 years earlier, replacing him. It was during Barnes's time as manager that long-serving kitman, Mark Trevor, ended his 12-year \"Labour of Love\", washing the kit of his local team. Having been at the club since 1997, he washed his last kit in August 2009, ahead of the club's home game against Charlton Athletic. Barnes's term as manager lasted considerably less time, and it was a five months before long-serving club physiotherapist Les Parry was given temporary charge. Rovers finished the season in 19th place in League One, avoiding relegation on the final day of the season, thanks to a 3–0 victory at Stockport County. In June 2010, Parry was given the manager's job on a permanent basis. He was sacked on 4 March 2012, after a 1–0 defeat by Chesterfield left the club only one point above the relegation zone, and replaced by Ronnie Moore for the remainder of the season. Moore won six of his thirteen games in charge at the end of the season, guiding Tranmere to a mid-table position, as they finished the season in the top half for the first time in several years. In April 2012, Moore signed a new one-year deal with Tranmere, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2012–13 season.\nTowards the end of the 2013–14 season, Moore admitted breaking the Football Association's betting rules, and Tranmere sacked him when the club were just clear of the relegation zone. Assistant John McMahon took over as caretaker manager, but Tranmere were relegated to League Two in the final gameof the season on the final day of the season. Rob Edwards was subsequently appointed as new manager.\nOn 11 August 2014, it was announced that former player and Football Association chief executive Mark Palios and his wife Nicola were taking a controlling interest in the club from outgoing chairman Peter Johnson. Mark Palios would become executive chairman of the club, with Johnson becoming its honorary president.\nAfter a poor start to the season, the home loss to Plymouth Argyle on 11 October 2014 saw Tranmere in last place in the Football League for the first time since 27 August 1987 after they had lost their first two matches of that season. Edwards was sacked as manager on 13 October. Mickey Adams took over a week later, with the aim of saving the club from relegation to the Conference. However, on 25 April 2015, after another defeat to Plymouth Argyle in the reverse fixture, Tranmere were relegated, ending their 94-year stay in the Football League.\n\nNon-League years\nGary Brabin was appointed as manager on 5 May 2015. It was a season of ups and downs, with poorer home form than away form. It took a while for Rovers to adjust to life in the non-league, with erratic form during the season. Tranmere finished sixth, one place outside the play-off zone, in Gary Brabin's first season.\nTranmere started the 2016–17 season well, ranking at the top of the non-league table at the end of August, after which Brabin received an award for manager of the month. Form later dipped which resulted in one goal scored in the next four games, with a 1–0 defeat to Sutton United resulting in Brabin being sacked on 18 September 2016. Assistant manager, ex-Southport boss Paul Carden took over on an interim basis. On 6 October 2016, former Tranmere player Micky Mellon was appointed permanent manager. His first game in charge was against cross-border rivals Wrexham, and ended with a 2–0 victory for Tranmere. Despite a 2nd-place finish and a club record 95-point haul, this still was not enough to gain automatic promotion back to the league. Tranmere faced Aldershot Town in the play-offs. A goal from James Norwood and a brace from Cole Stockton in the first leg away at the Recreation Ground saw Rovers take a 3–0 lead back to Prenton Park for the second leg, which ended in a 2–2 draw, Norwood and Stockton once again on the scoresheet. This gave Tranmere a 5–2 aggregate win and their first Wembley appearance in 17 years. Tranmere lost 3–1 in the 2017 National League play-off final the 3–1 to Forest Green Rovers.\nTranmere's 2017–18 season got off to a poor start, with 3 wins from the first 12 games. Tranmere slipped to 18th in the table, their lowest ever league position. A spectacular winter turnaround saw Tranmere move into the play-off spots, where they remained for the rest of the season. This turnaround included a record-breaking run of 9 consecutive home league wins. This record-breaking stint was ended in February by a 4–1 defeat to eventual title winner Macclesfield Town. Tranmere responded to this defeat by winning 8 out of their next 9 games, finishing the season as National League runners-up for the second time in as many years, qualifying for the play-offs. In the play-off semi-final, Tranmere met Ebbsfleet United at home. Tranmere came from behind twice to take the game to extra time before prevailing 4–2 after extra time, a result which sent Tranmere to Wembley Stadium for the National League play-off final. On 12 May 2018, a crowd of 16,306 were at Wembley for the final against Boreham Wood. Tranmere were 2–1 victors, their first trophy in 27 years, and were promoted back to the Football League.\n\nReturn to the Football League\nUnder the chairmanship of Mark Palios and the management of Micky Mellon, Tranmere played in League Two for the 2018–19 season, finishing 6th and thereby reaching the play-offs. On 25 May 2019, Tranmere secured back-to-back promotions, beating Newport County 1–0 at Wembley Stadium. They did so with a goal from Connor Jennings in the 119th minute, thus securing their spot in League One for the 2019–20 season.\nBy March 2020, the team were within the relegation zone, but with a game in hand on their nearest rivals and on a run of three successive victories. The cancellation of fixtures due to the COVID-19 pandemic meant that the season could not be completed, and a vote was taken by League One clubs on 9 June to resolve promotion and relegation issues on a points per game (PPG) basis. This meant that Tranmere would be demoted to League Two for the 2020–21 season. Club chairman Mark Palios said that the decision was unfair and that he was considering legal action as a result. He also announced that 20 members of staff would have to be made redundant.\nWith the team back in League Two, Mike Jackson was named as manager of Tranmere on 18 July 2020. He was sacked on 31 October 2020. Keith Hill succeeded temporary manager Ian Dawes on 21 November 2020. He was sacked on 11 May 2021, after the side reached the play-offs, but before the play-off matches had started. Morecambe defeated Tranmere in the play-off semi-final. At the end of May 2021, Tranmere announced that Micky Mellon was returning to the club as manager, having spent the season apart in charge of Dundee United. Despite a strong start to the season, Tranmere sacked Mellon on 19 March 2023, following results that included a total of six wins since mid-October 2022. Dawes oversaw seven games as caretaker manager before being appoinbted the permanent manager, but Tranmere sacked him in early September 2023 after six consecutive defeats; Tranmere appointed their technical director Nigel Adkins as interim manager.\n\nColours and crest\nBelmont F.C., the forerunners of today's Rovers, wore blue shirts and white shorts, as did the early Rovers, until a radical change in 1889, when a combination of maroon and orange shirts and navy blue shorts was introduced to \"dazzle\" their opponents in the West Lancashire League. These were abandoned in 1904 in favour of the earlier blue and white colours which have, in some form or other, remained until the present day. In 1962, Dave Russell introduced a white strip with blue trim, saying \"Tranmere Rovers should have a specific identity of its own, so on Merseyside there's now Liverpool's Red, Everton's blue and Tranmere's white\". Since then, the team have worn varying combinations of blue and white, moving back towards a more predominantly white kit in 2000. The team's colours are reflected in their nickname of the \"Superwhites\".\nTranmere first introduced a badge on their shirt in 1962, wearing the coat of arms of the borough of Birkenhead, along with adopting their motto \"Ubi fides ibi lux et robur\", meaning \"Where there is faith there is light and strength\". The crest was replaced in 1972 by a monogram, and, in 1981, by a simplified blue and white shield. In 1987, a complex  heraldic crest was introduced, adapting the Birkenhead crest through the inclusion of a football and a TRFC logo. The simpler badge was adopted in 1997, and modified slightly in 2009 to mark the club's 125-year anniversary. The blue and white crest incorporated simplified elements of the Birkenhead civic coat of arms: the crosier and lion originally formed part of the Birkenhead Priory seal; the oak tree was a symbol of the Tranmere Local Board; the star or starfish represents Bebington; the two lions represent Oxton; and the crescents may represent the Laird family.\nFor the 2021–22 season, Tranmere reverted to their pre-1997 badge.\n\nStadium\nRovers played their first matches at Steeles Field in Birkenhead but, in 1887, they bought a new site from Tranmere Rugby Club. The ground was variously referred to as the \"Borough Road Enclosure\", \"Ravenshaw's Field\" and \"South Road\". The name \"Prenton Park\" was adopted in 1895 as a result of a suggestion in the letters page of the Football Echo. Because the land was required for housing and a school, Tranmere were forced to move and the name went with them. The present Prenton Park was opened on 9 March 1912. There were stands (also known as bleachers) on both sides of the pitch, a paddock and three open terraces, the general format which remained until 1994.\nMany improvements to the ground were driven by changes in legislation. The biggest change of all took place during 1994 and 1995. The Taylor Report suggested that all stadia in the top two divisions of English football should no longer permit standing. The club's response was to redevelop three sides of the ground with entirely new all-seater stands created – the Borough Road Stand (now the Johnny King Stand), the Cowshed and the new Kop, in addition to the existing Main Stand. Capacity in the ground thus increased from 14,200 to the 16,567 of today. On 11 March 1995, having been built at a cost of £3.1 million, the new ground was officially opened.\nAttendances at the ground have fluctuated over its hundred-year history. Around 8,000 visitors watched the first game at the stadium, as Tranmere beat Lancaster Town 8–0. Prenton Park's largest-ever crowd was 24,424 for a 1972 FA Cup match between Tranmere and Stoke City. Average attendances for home games between 2008 and 2011 ranged from above 5,000 to under 6,000.\n\nSupporters and rivalries\nTranmere Rovers had an average home attendance of 6,552 during the 2018–19 season, making them the 4th best supported club in League Two and 42nd in The Football League as a whole. The club has a number of supporters' groups, including the Tranmere Rovers Supporters Trust; in 2010, the trust raised £12,500 for the club to sign Andy Robinson on loan. In 2011, they raised £200,000 and planned to purchase a controlling interest in Tranmere. TSB (Tranmere Stand Boys) is the hooligan firm associated with the club. Tranmere Rovers have been the subject of an independent supporters' fanzine Give Us an R since the 1990s.\nDespite being geographically closest to Everton and Liverpool, Tranmere's time in the lower leagues has meant that they have rarely met either club and have built up traditional rivalries with near neighbours Wrexham, Chester, and Southport, the latter two of which are now non-league clubs. According to a survey entitled 'The League of Love and Hate' conducted in August 2019, Tranmere fans listed the more distant Bolton Wanderers and Oldham Athletic as their biggest rivals, followed by Everton, Liverpool and Crewe Alexandra, although the results were open to debate as the census does not contain non-league clubs. Tranmere also had a fierce rivalry with Wallasey-based near neighbour New Brighton, until that club failed to be re-elected to the Football League in 1951.\nAs of the end of the 2022–23 season, Tranmere had met the following teams most times in the Football League:\n\nTranmere Rovers Ladies\nTranmere Rovers Ladies Football Club were founded in 1990. Based in the Wirral, they are affiliated with the men's team, and play home games at Villa Park, the home of Ashville F.C., in Wallasey. Between 1996 and 2004 they competed in the FA Premier League National Division, then the top tier of the English women's football pyramid. Since 2011, they have played in the North West Regional League, Premier Division. As of the start of the 2011–12 season, they have won the Cheshire Cup a record 11 times.\n\nPlayers\nFirst-team squad\nAs of 10 September 2024\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\nFormer players\nAs part of the club's 125th anniversary celebrations in 2010, a hall of fame was announced, initially honouring seven former players and managers: Ian Muir, John Aldridge, John King, Ray Mathias, Steve Mungall, John Morrissey, and Pat Nevin. Harold Bell holds the record for the most consecutive league appearances for a British team. He was picked for the first game after the Second World War in the 1946–47 season and did not miss a match until 30 August 1955, a total of 401 consecutive matches in the Third Division North.\n\nOfficials\nCoaching staff\nAs of 26 September 2024\n\nManagers\nBy the start of the 2024–25 season, the club had employed 40 managers. The first man to hold this position was Bert Cooke, appointed in 1912. He oversaw the club's entry into the Football League, and remained in charge for 23 years, the longest spell of any manager at the club. Major changes were not seen until businessman Dave Russell took over in 1961. His introductions included the team's current all-white kit and regularly arranged floodlit home fixtures on Friday evenings rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. Rock band and Tranmere fans Half Man Half Biscuit described the practice in their song \"Friday Night And The Gates Are Low\".\nTranmere's most successful period came at the end of the twentieth century. John King returned for his third spell at the club in 1987, having previously both played for and managed the team. He led them to a victory in the League Trophy, and from the bottom of the Fourth Division to, on three occasions, reach the semi-finals in play-offs that had as their prize a promotion to the Premier League. Under King's replacement, John Aldridge, Tranmere appeared in the 2000 Football League Cup final. From 2009, they were managed by former club physiotherapist, Les Parry, until he was sacked on 4 March 2012, and replaced by Ronnie Moore. In February 2014, media reports suggested Moore was under investigation by The Football Association, for breaching its rules against betting on competitions in which his club were involved.  Three days later, Tranmere suspended Moore, and then sacked him on 9 April 2014, after he conceded that the FA's charges were valid.\nOn 27 May 2014, the club announced that Rob Edwards had been appointed as their new manager. Tranmere sacked Edwards on 13 October 2014. Moving quickly to arrest the decline which had seen Tranmere slump to the bottom of League Two, Tranmere announced former Port Vale manager Micky Adams's appointment as Edwards's successor on 16 October 2014. He left the club by mutual consent on 19 April 2015, when the club were bottom of the league with two matches remaining. Gary Brabin, whose contract was in turn ended in September 2016, replaced Adams. Tranmere appointed Micky Mellon as manager the following month, and he led the team to a pair of consecutive play-off final victories in the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons, the last of which brought a return to League One for the club. After four years at Tranmere, Mellon moved to Dundee United on 6 July 2020.\nOn 18 July 2020, Mellon's former assistant manager Mike Jackson was appointed as manager, however his tenure was short-lived. After only two league wins in his first 10 games Jackson was sacked on 31 October 2020 following a 1–0 home defeat to Morecambe. Keith Hill replaced Jackson as first team manager on 21 November. Hill's first game ended in a 1–0 victory against Carlisle United. His side were top of the form table (after 20 games) in February, the team's spine spearheaded by Scott Davies, Peter Clarke, Manny Monthé, Jay Spearing, Paul Lewis and finally, James Vaughan, who is still the youngest ever Premier League goalscorer since 2005. Hill was sacked in May 2021, after the team had reached the League Two play-offs, but before the play-off matches took place. At the end of May 2021, Micky Mellon returned to Tranmere for a second spell as manager.\nFull time managers are shown below (excluding caretaker managers).\n\nHonours\nSource:\nLeague\n\nThird Division North / Third Division (level 3)\nChampions: 1937–38\nPlay-off winners: 1991\nFourth Division / League Two (level 4)\nRunners-up: 1988–89\nPromoted: 1966–67, 1975–76\nPlay-off winners: 2019\nNational League (level 5)\nPlay-off winners: 2018\nThe Combination\nChampions: 1907–08\nLancashire Combination\nChampions: 1913–14\nLancashire Combination Division Two\nPromoted: 1911–12\nCup\n\nFootball League Cup\nRunners-up: 1999–2000\nAssociate Members' Cup / Football League Trophy / EFL Trophy\nWinners: 1989–90\nRunners-up: 1990–91, 2020–21\nWelsh Cup\nWinners: 1934–35\n\nRecords\nHighest league finish: 4th in First Division (level 2), 1992–93\nBest FA Cup performance: Quarter-finals, 1999–2000, 2000–01, 2003–04\nBest League Cup performance: Runners-up, 1999–2000\nBest League Trophy performance: Winners, 1989–90\nBest FA Trophy performance: Semi-finals, 2016–17\nRecord win:\n13–4, against Oldham Athletic, 26 December 1935 The aggregate of 17 goals in one game remains a league record.\n9–0 against Solihull Moors, 8 April 2017\nRecord defeat:\n1–9 against Tottenham Hotspur, FA Cup 3rd round replay, 14 January 1953\nHighest home attendance: 24,424, against Stoke City, 5 February 1972, FA Cup\nMost goals (total): Ian Muir, 180\nMost goals in a season: Bunny Bell (1934–35) and John Aldridge (1991–92), 40\nMost appearances: Ray Mathias, 637\n\nReferences\nGeneral\nBishop, Peter (1990).

        "content": "Grady Judd (born March 10, 1954) is an American law enforcement officer and serves as the sheriff of Polk County, Florida since 2005. He has been known for his aggressive approach towards the inmate population in the correctional facility he manages and cutting facility budgets used to take care of the inmate population to cut down on costs for Polk County and the State of Florida.\n\nEarly life and education\nGrady Judd was born in Lakeland, Florida, in 1954. He earned both bachelor's and master's degrees from Rollins College, and graduated from the FBI National Academy. He was awarded two honorary doctorates. Webber International University presented Judd with an Honorary Doctorate of Business in 2015, and Warner University presented him with an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Studies in 2020.\n\nCareer\nJudd started working for the Polk County Sheriff's Office (PCSO) in 1972 as a dispatcher. As the first employee under the age of 21 in the department, he was required to get his father to purchase his ammunition. At the age of 27, he attained the rank of captain, supervising 44 employees, all of whom were older than he. He was elected as the sheriff of Polk County in 2004, and re-elected in 2008, 2012, and 2016.  In the 2020 election campaign, Judd ran unopposed. Judd served as an adjunct professor at the University of South Florida and Florida Southern College.\nJudd served as president of the Florida Sheriffs Association (2013–2014) and president of the Major County Sheriffs of America (2018–2019). He is a commissioner on the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission. Judd served as an active member of the Bartow Rotary Club since 1994, and was a member of the board of directors for the club from 1996 to 1999.\nJudd gained publicity as a sheriff with his \"tell it how it is\" demeanor. In 2006, after a traffic stop resulted in a deputy and his K-9 dog shot and killed, deputies shot and killed the suspect, shooting him 68 times. Asked by a reporter about the number of shots, Judd responded, \"That's all the bullets we had, or we would have shot him more.\"\nIn 2020, Judd was appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump to serve a three-year term on the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.\nWhile the Office of Sheriff in Polk County is non-partisan, Judd frequently endorses Republican political candidates. In a 2022 news conference, Judd referred to Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as the \"greatest governor in the United States of America.\"\n\nElections\n2004\nJudd was elected Sheriff of Polk County in his first run for public office. Judd received 64% of the vote in a three-way non-partisan race against attorney and former FBI Special Agent Kirk Warren (20%) and Polk deputy Pete Karashay (16%).\nJudd was preceded in office by Lawrence W. Crow, Jr. who served 17 years as sheriff and declined to run in 2004. Crow was appointed by Governor Bob Martinez in 1987 and served until Judd was sworn into office.\n\n2008\nJudd was re-elected by defeating write-in candidate Michael Lashman. Judd received 96% of the vote; Lashman received just under 4%.\n\n2012\nJudd again faced write-in candidate Michael Lashman, a flooring contractor from Lakeland, in his third campaign for sheriff. Judd again won with 96% of the vote, with 215,320 votes.\n\n2016\nJudd ran for a fourth term of office in 2016 and was elected with 95.3% of the vote compared to 4.7% for write-in ballots.\n\n2020\nJudd ran for a fifth term of office in 2020 and was reelected unopposed, making Judd the first sheriff in Polk’s 160-year history to be elected to five terms.\n\nProfessional affiliations\nSheriff Judd was elected President of the Florida Sheriffs Association in 2013. Prior to that, he served as chair for the FSA board of directors and held the positions of treasurer, secretary, and vice president. In 2018, Judd was sworn in as President of the Major County Sheriffs of America for a two-year term, and is now a member of the executive board as immediate past president. In 2019, Judd was appointed by the National Sheriffs' Association to serve on the School Safety and Security Committee.\n\nCareer highlights\nOperation Swipe Left for Meth\nJudd was featured on The News with Shepard Smith where he detailed a six-month undercover drug investigation that identified 68 people who conducted drug sales on three social media and mobile dating apps: Grindr, Scruff, and Taimi. At the time the segment aired (January 27, 2022), 60 people were arrested; the other eight were wanted on Polk County Sheriff's Office arrest warrants.\n\nMCSA Sheriff of the Year\nJudd was the first recipient of the inaugural \"Sandra S. Hutchens Sheriff of the Year\" award, presented by the Major County Sheriffs of America in February 2022 at the MCSA 2022 Winter Conference. The award was given to Judd in praise of his \"steady leadership, mentorship, and friendship at the helm of MCSA [which] gave this association a visionary foundation for growth to 'Lead the Way' in the profession of law enforcement.\" The MCSA, established in 1998, is a professional law enforcement association of the 113 largest sheriff's offices representing counties or parishes with a population of 500,000 or more.\n\n50 Years of Service\nJudd was featured in a PoliceOne article, America's favorite sheriff talks about cops, criminals and his 50-year career where he shared about serving the Polk County Sheriff's Office and the citizens of Polk County during his career spanning 50 years.\n\nAwards\nJudd was awarded the \"2022 Faith Based Patriot of the Year\" award by The Faith Based Republican Club of West Polk County, on June 1, 2023, during their \"Defend Freedom Night\" program.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nPolk County Sheriff's Office"

        "content": "Broken is a 2012 British coming-of-age drama film directed by Rufus Norris in his feature directorial debut. The screenplay, written by Mark O'Rowe, is based on Daniel Clay's 2008 novel of the same name and inspired by Harper Lee's 1960 novel To Kill a Mockingbird. The film stars Tim Roth, Cillian Murphy, and Eloise Laurence, with Rory Kinnear, Robert Emms, Zana Marjanović, Clare Burt, Bill Milner, and Denis Lawson in supporting roles. It tells the story of a young girl in North London whose life changes after witnessing a violent attack.\nThe film premiered at the 65th Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2012, and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 8 March 2013, by StudioCanal. It received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who mostly praised Norris' direction and the performances of the cast. At the 15th British Independent Film Awards, it earned a leading nine nominations and won in two categories: Best British Independent Film and Best Supporting Actor (for Kinnear). Norris was nominated for the European Discovery at the 25th European Film Awards.\n\nPlot\nEleven-year-old diabetic Emily 'Skunk' Cunningham lives with her solicitor father Archie, her elder brother Jed, and au pair Kasia on a cul-de-sac in a British suburb. One of her few friends is Rick, a slightly simple young man living with his parents in a nearby house.\nSkunk is shocked when Rick gets beaten up by single-father Mr. Oswald, another neighbour: one of three of his daughters (Saskia, Susan, and Sunrise) has falsely accused Rick of rape. He is released when she is proven a liar, but he closes himself off. From then on Skunk's life goes downhill.\nKasia splits up with her boyfriend Mike, who is also Skunk's favourite teacher. Rick is put into a mental ward as he isolates himself more and more. Archie and Kasia are beginning a relationship, a shock to both Mike and Skunk. Oswald's daughters start bullying Skunk when the new term starts. Her first boyfriend suddenly has to move away, and does not tell her until the day before he leaves.\nOne of Oswald's daughters, Susan, gets pregnant by one of her many sexual partners, panics, and falsely accuses Mike. Oswald barges into Skunk's classroom and beats Mike. While Oswald is in jail, Archie provides legal services to Mike, and the three daughters throw a drunken party. Susan experiences a miscarriage at a house party, then dies, leading to Oswald's release.\nSkunk secretly visits Rick when he has his first weekend at home. When she enters the house, she finds that Rick has accidentally broken his mother's neck, pushing her down the stairs, then panicked and knocked out his father. He won't let Skunk leave and does not realise Skunk's diabetes takes her into a hypoglycemic coma. Oswald finds Skunk, and a dead Rick (suicide), and gets her to hospital.\nIn a dream sequence, Skunk bids farewell to people from her childhood, including the recently dead, then sees her grown self, holding her baby. She wakes up in the hospital, with her father at her side.\n\nCast\nProduction\nIn May 2011, it was announced that Rufus Norris would make his feature directorial debut with Broken, adapted by Mark O'Rowe from the 2008 novel of the same name by Daniel Clay. Cillian Murphy was set to star that month, while Tim Roth, Rory Kinnear, Robert Emms, Zana Marjanović, Bill Milner, and Eloise Laurence joined the cast in October 2011.\nBroken was inspired by Harper Lee's 1960 classic novel To Kill a Mockingbird, but was not a literal re-imagining. The film was produced by Cuba Pictures and funded by BBC Films and the BFI in association with LipSync Productions and Bill Kenwright Films. Principal photography began on 17 October 2011 in Greater London, England, and lasted for five weeks.\n\nRelease\nBroken had its world premiere as the opening night film of the Critics' Week section at the 65th Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2012. Wild Bunch handled the film's international sales.\nIn 2012, Le Pacte acquired French distribution rights in May, StudioCanal acquired U.K. distribution rights in July, and Film Movement acquired U.S. distribution rights in September. The film was theatrically released in France on 22 August 2012, in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 8 March 2013, and in the United States on 19 July 2013. It was released on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on 8 July 2013.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 62% of 55 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.1/10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 53 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film two out of five stars and wrote, \"There are some good ideas, strong moments and a blue-chip cast in Broken […]. But they somehow don't come together successfully in this drama of dysfunction and pain, which too often looks strained, desperately self-conscious and replete with unconvincing and unearned emotional crises.\"\nDavid Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter stated, \"Overburdened as it is by narrative clutter and climactic melodrama, Broken is always emotionally engaging, never more so than when Laurence is at the center of a scene. She has a sweet, natural screen presence, quirky without being cute. The entire ensemble is solid, with the terrific Kinnear making an especially vivid impression as the neighbor from hell.\"\nFabien Lemercier of Cineuropa commented, \"Broken reveals itself as a highly precise clockwork, endowed with an irresistible charm, thanks in part to a charismatic young actress (Eloise Laurence) and outstanding work on editing and music.\"\nCharles Gant of Variety opined, \"Melding heightened drama with quirky, state-of-the-nation social realism, the pic aims to undercut epic plot contrivance with naturalistic perfs and a lyrical shooting style.\"\nStephen Holden of The New York Times called the film \"fine but unnecessarily convoluted\" and wrote, \"At a certain point, Mr. Norris forsakes realism for theatricalized fantasy, and Broken ultimately loses its stylistic cohesion, if not its humanity.\"\nMark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times remarked, \"Solidly done if somewhat unremarkable, there is nothing particularly wrong with Broken, nothing that needs fixing exactly, and yet it never fully comes together.\"\nKevin Jagernauth of IndieWire commented, \"If there's any silver lining to Broken, it's the performance of Laurence, who shines and delivers both laughs and heartache in the film. […] As for the rest of the cast, they are mostly wasted in one-dimensional roles that don't provide much growth. Broken simply can't get it together on any level, delivering a tedious drama, that for all the characters and over-emoting, doesn't have much to say.\"\nBen Kenigsberg of RogerEbert.com gave the film two and a half out of four stars and described it as \"an absorbing coming-of-age drama that suddenly, pointlessly self-destructs with an onslaught of cheap ironies and overkill.\" Kenigsberg also stated, \"Imagine To Kill a Mockingbird with multiple trumped-up medical emergencies and a cynically manipulative finale, and you might have a sense of how Norris's film plays by the end: broken, smashed, destroyed.\"\n\nAccolades\nSee also\nList of films featuring diabetes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBroken at IMDb\nBroken at AllMovie\nBroken at BBC Online"

        "content": "Cleopatra (Japanese: クレオパトラ, Hepburn: Kureopatora) is a 1970 Japanese adult anime fantasy film directed by Osamu Tezuka and Eiichi Yamamoto. The film is the second part of Mushi Production's adult-oriented Animerama trilogy, following A Thousand and One Nights (1969) and preceding Belladonna of Sadness (1973).\nThe film was a critical and commercial failure. A manga adaptation of the film, also from Tezuka and Hisashi Sakaguchi, was released later that same year in October exclusively in COM, and was reprinted in late 2018.\n\nPlot\nIn the far future, three humans—Jirou, Hal, and Maria—discover that an alien race called the Pasateli intends to conquer humankind with the mysterious \"Cleopatra Plan\". Using a time machine, the three transport their minds into the bodies of members of the historical Cleopatra's court to discover and stop the plan. Hal, however, vows to use the opportunity to secure the title of the greatest lover who ever lived by having sex with Cleopatra.\nIn the middle of the Roman conquest of Egypt, a group of Egyptians secretly plot a rebellion to overthrow Julius Caesar. The group plans to send Cleopatra to seduce and murder Caesar. The Romans discover the group and attack them. Cleopatra escapes, along with her handmaidens Libya and Apollodoria. Cleopatra goes to an ancient priestess, who magically grants her an irresistibly seductive body for her mission.\nIt is at this point when Jirou, Hal, and Maria arrive: Maria is now Libya; Hal finds himself in the body of the priestess' pet leopard Rupa, thwarting his plans to seduce Cleopatra; and Jirou finds himself in the body of Ionius, a Greek man captured and enslaved by the Romans. Ionius frees himself and the other slaves by using his knowledge of future technology to make modern hand grenades. They accompany Cleopatra to meet Caesar, who is so overcome by her beauty that he makes her queen of Egypt. Caesar recaptures Ionius and, amused by his fighting skills, orders him to fight in the gladiatorial arena. He gives Ionius a modern-day handgun to ensure his victory. Ionius proves so popular with the Roman public that Caesar's own popularity soars, leading his senators to conspire to murder both him and Ionius to end their influence.\nLibya and Apollodoria insist Cleopatra must murder Caesar; Cleopatra, however, has had a change of heart and keeps putting off the assassination in favor of sex. They accompany Caesar back to Rome, just in time for him to be assassinated by his own senators. Caesar's adopted son, Octavian—soon to be called Augustus—takes command. Cleopatra tries to continue the plan by seducing Octavian, only to learn that he is homosexual and impervious to her charms. Meanwhile, Caesar's right-hand man, Marcus Antonius or Anthony, falls in love and has sex with Cleopatra. Octavian, on the other hand, is attracted to Ionius and spares his life.\nFinally, during the Battle of Actium where Octavian's fleet defeats Anthony's Egyptian fleet, Anthony kills himself. Octavian goes to Cleopatra to persuade her to surrender; she is taken into custody by the Romans. Distraught and disappointed by the rejection after Anthony's death, Cleopatra commits suicide using an asp's venomous bite.\nThe time travelers return to the future and report that the Cleopatra Plan is a scheme by the Pasateli to assume the form of beautiful human women to seduce and destroy Earth's most powerful male leaders. The Pasateli have already taken their human forms and are poised to strike when this information arrives, but Earth is able to root them out and save the world in time.\n\nCast\nChinatsu Nakayama as Cleopatra\nHajime Hana as Julius Caesar\nOsami Nabe as Marcus Antonius\nJitsuko Yoshimura as Maria Fellow/Libya\nTsubame Yanagiya as Hal Witcher/Rupa\nNobuo Tsukamoto as Jirou Tani/Ionius\nKazuko Imai as Calpurnia\nSusumu Abe as Cabagonis\nNachi Nozawa as Octavian\nKotoe Hatsui as Apollodoria\nYoshirō Katō as Chief Tarabahha\n\nRelease\nIn 1972, Mushi Productions, who made the film, accepted a deal with Xanadu Productions Inc., a small distributor, to release a subtitled version of the film in the United States to try to save themselves from bankruptcy. When it was released in the United States, Xanadu changed the title to Cleopatra: Queen of Sex and released it with a self-applied X-rating on April 24, playing at the Bijou theatre and presumably other theatres. It was advertised as the first X-rated animated film in the United States, but Fritz the Cat came out with its X-rating from the MPAA before it on April 18 of the same year.\nThe film was not received well by audiences in America, and was not a success at the box office, due to false advertising claiming it to be a \"pornographic\" film, which caused people who saw the film to want refunds. It was not successful in its native Japan either.\nCritics give it mixed reviews. Howard Thompson of The New York Times said it was basically a movie that involved \"mostly a voluptuously drawn Cleopatra and a bevy of cuties that trot around bare-breasted\", but praised the \"lavish backgrounds\" and some of the imagery and color. Variety called the film \"partly sophomoric\", with \"emphasis on vulgar low comedy\", but praised it for having good animation and color.\nCleopatra was not submitted to the MPAA, and might not have received an X-rating if it had been.\nIn its native country, it has been released on VHS, VHD, Laserdisc, and DVD (bundled with A Thousand and One Nights and Belladonna of Sadness or released separately) throughout the following years. Third Window Films released the film bundled with A Thousand and One Nights on Blu-ray for the first time and on DVD on June 18, 2018, for Region B and Region 2 territories. Discotek Media released the film on Blu-ray for Region A territories on October 27, 2020.\n\nSee also\nList of Osamu Tezuka anime\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nCleopatra at IMDb\nCleopatra (anime) at Anime News Network's encyclopedia\nCleopatra in the TezukaOsamu.net database"

        "content": "Thompson Square Conservation Area is a heritage-listed precinct centred around Thompson Square in Windsor, City of Hawkesbury, New South Wales, Australia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nHistory\nThompson Square preserves the early colonial character of Windsor. The centre of Thompson Square is spoilt by a main road which slices diagonally through it and into a cutting, destroying the visual integrity of the space as was originally intended.\nThe conservation area includes the following historic buildings:\n\nThe Doctor's House – 1–3 Thompson Square\nIn 1819 James Doyle leased a dwelling and tenement known as the Freemason's Arms on the site of the Doctor's House from Charles Beasley. The 1828 census states Doyle as an innkeeper at Windsor. In 1830 Doyle was licensed to sell wine at the house known as the \"Lord Nelson\" at Windsor Terrace. In 1831 Joseph Delandre is listed as the licensee of the \"Lord Nelson\". In 1837 Edward Coffey issued a notice stating that the 'Daniel O'Conner Hotel' at Windsor had opened for the reception of visitors. It adjoined the Kings Wharf, the premises formerly occupied by James Doyle. It has not been established that this was in fact the present Doctors House, though the building is certainly colonial in style.\n\nHouse & outbuildings – 5 Thompson Square\nHawkesbury Museum – 7 Thompson Square\nThe land on which this building stands was part of grant of 12 ha to William Baker in 1800. The site was then given as a town allotment to John Howe in 1811. The building is claimed to have been built about 1843.\n\nMacquarie Arms Hotel – cnr Thompson and George Streets\nDuring Macquarie's tour of the district in 1811 he gave a large allotment in the square to Richard Fitzgerald on the express condition that he immediately build a handsome commodious inn of brick or stone and to be of at least two stories high. It was built in 1815 and named in honour of Governor Macquarie.\n\nCottage – 62 George Street\nBuilt 1830–1840.\n\nShop – 66, 68 George Street\nShop (formerly Hawkesbury Garage) – 70, 72 George Street\nProbably from the 1920s.\n\nShop (A. C Stearn Building) – 74 George Street\nPhotographic evidence indicated that it was originally a single storey building with parapet and with a convex profile corrugated iron street awning. The existing urns and lion were originally on the single storey building. The second storey parapet is dated 1907.\n\nSites – 4 Bridge Street & 60 George Street\nHouse & outbuildings – 6 Bridge Street\nBuilt c. 1830.\n\nHouse & outbuildings – 10 Bridge Street\nBuilt c. 1850.\n\nHouse – 17 Bridge Street\nFormer School of Arts – cnr Bridge Street and George Street\nBuilt 1861.\n\nDescription\nThompson Square consists of George Street, Bridge Street, Thompson Square and The Terrace. These streets surround a small turfed reserve with pleasant trees that helps to conserve an attractive frontage to the important surrounding buildings.\nOne large old hoop pine tree (Araucaria cunninghamii) over the cutting for the Putty Road is reputed to be all that remains of the mid-late 19th century plantings around the square. Once there were Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria heterophylla) on the square's western side outside the Macquarie Arms Hotel and in front of the Fitzgerald wall. These were removed, as well as native fig tree species, after protests concerning acts of public indecency by people leaving the nearby hotel relieving themselves under the trees. Also growing around the square are several silky oak trees (Grevillea robusta) and one kurrajong (Brachychiton populneus).\nThompson Square is surrounded by a number of Colonial Georgian buildings including;\n\nThe Doctor's House – 1–3 Thompson Square\nA fine, substantial two storey sandstone brick terrace building. It has a good joinery attic storey, fine front door flanked by engaged columns and a very well designed fanlight.\n\nHouse & outbuildings – 5 Thompson Square\nA brick Georgian single storey cottage of three bays with a corrugated iron roof and three bay timber verandah.\n\nHawkesbury Museum – 7 Thompson Square\nA brick Georgian two storeyed house with corrugated iron roof, five bays wide with a five bay verandah. The balcony is a Victorian addition and has a fine cast iron balustrade.\n\nMacquarie Arms Hotel – cnr Thompson and George Streets\nA two storeyed stuccoed brick inn with attic storey and cellars and corrugated iron roof. The Colonial character has been impaired with the addition of box like protuberances to the corners of the building.\n\nVacant site – 60 George Street\nCottage – 62 George Street\nA single storey Georgian cottage. A Victorian cast iron columns, balustrading and valance.\n\nShops – 64, 66, 68 George Street\nA two-storey stuccoed brick house and shop formerly occupied by Georgian single storey terraces.\n\n70, 72 George Street\nFormerly Hawkesbury Garage, now a shop.\n\n74 George Street (A.C Stearn Building)\nStuccoed two storey building with a parapet to the street front.\n\n82 George Street\nOne storey house turned into a shop.\n\nVacant site – 4 Bridge Street\nHouse & outbuildings – 6 Bridge Street\nA brick Georgian cottage of five bays with a three bay timber verandah and balancing brick chimneys and corrugated iron roof.\n\nHouse & outbuildings – 10 Bridge Street\nA two-storey brick Regency style building with a particularly fine cast iron verandah, balcony and stuccoed parapet.\n\nHouse – 17 Bridge Street\nA brick Georgian single storey cottage with corrugated iron roof, of five bays.\n\nFormer School of Arts – cnr Bridge Street and George Street\nA single storey brick stuccoed Italianate hall with the later additions of side wings and a loggia.\n\nPioneer Families Bicentennial Memorial\nFeaturing an anchor, symbolising the importance of the river in the history of the town and the nation, with a plaque recording the names of many of the early families.\n\nHeritage listing\nThompson Square is one of the oldest public squares in Australia and notable for the large number of Colonial Georgian buildings which surround it.

        "content": "Jeopardy! is an American television quiz show created by Merv Griffin, in which contestants are presented with clues in the form of answers and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. Over the years, the show has featured many tournaments and special events.\n\nRegular tournaments and events\nTournament of Champions\nJeopardy! has conducted a regular tournament called the \"Tournament of Champions\", featuring the most successful champions and other big winners who have appeared on the show since the last tournament. It was held every year during Art Fleming's hosting run and has been held roughly once a year, with some exceptions, since 1984.\nThe current series' Tournament of Champions originally lasted two weeks over ten episodes in a format devised by then-host and producer Alex Trebek in 1985. The field consists of fifteen former champions, with automatic bids given to winners of any College Championships or Teachers Tournaments held since the previous Tournament of Champions. Since the 2004 tournament, the rest of the field has been set depending on how many games a champion was able to win during their reign, with a contestant needing to win at least three wins to be considered (up to shows taped on October 29, 2020, the last tape day with Alex Trebek hosting; Sony ended the Tournament of Champions cycle after Trebek's death ten days later)—later changed to four wins (effective with the new cycle that began with shows taped November 30, 2020, when production resumed with Ken Jennings as the first interim host). Total winnings are also used if there are multiple champions with the same number of victories. The qualifying rules were changed after the show allowed contestants to continue playing until they were defeated during the twentieth season; prior to that, any champion who won a total of five games retired undefeated and automatically earned a slot in the Tournament of Champions.\nThe first week consisted of five quarterfinal matches featuring three different champions each day. The winners of those five games, plus the four highest-scoring non-winners in the tournament (known as wild cards), advanced to the semifinals, where the three winners of the three semifinal matches advance to the finals and compete for the championship in a two-game final match. Each game in this match is scored separately from the other; if a finalist ends the Double Jeopardy! round with a zero or negative total, their score for that day is recorded as zero. The combined totals from both games are used to determine the overall standings.\nThe top prize for the Tournament of Champions on the current series was initially $100,000. Beginning with the 2003 Tournament of Champions, which was the first held after the clue values were doubled in 2001, the prize was increased to $250,000. After the initial tournament, where they were guaranteed to receive their cumulative total in cash, each runner-up has been guaranteed a minimum dollar amount depending on their placing. The current figures were established in 2006, with a minimum of $100,000 for second place and $50,000 for third. If the scores exceeded the minimum guarantees, they were awarded the higher score. Players eliminated before the finals win a fixed award of $5,000 for quarterfinalists or $10,000 for semifinalists.\nOn the Fleming-era tournaments, all players kept their scores in cash at the end of each game, and in addition to their game winnings, the Grand Champions also won a tropical vacation and were presented with a trophy called the Griffin Award, named for Merv Griffin.\nThe Season 37 tournament, which was when the show used various interim hosts, was hosted by Buzzy Cohen, who won the Season 34 tournament.\nThe Season 39 tournament featured a new format which provided an expanded field of 21 contestants. Three contestants who won 20+ games—Matt Amodio, Amy Schneider, and Mattea Roach—automatically qualified for the semifinal rounds, while the remaining 18 contestants played six quarterfinal games. The six winners advanced to the semifinals and joined the top three seeds; there were no wild cards. To prevent preemption by Election Day coverage in some markets, the November 8, 2022 episode was a \"warm-up\" exhibition game for Amodio, Schneider, and Roach, with no prize money at stake. The winners of the semifinal matches advanced to the finals, which consisted of a minimum of three and a maximum of seven games, similar to the Greatest of All Time tournament (see below). The first finalist to win three games won the tournament and the $250,000 top prize. The second-place and third-place prizes were determined first by number of wins, then by number of second-place finishes, and finally by total score across all games played, and won $100,000 and $50,000, respectively. Furthermore, all three finalists received entry into the Jeopardy! Masters tournament.\nThe format was changed again in Season 40, now featuring an even more expanded field of 27 contestants who played in nine quarterfinal games. The nine winners of the quarterfinal games proceed to the semifinals, and the three winners of those games proceed to the finals. The format of the finals is retained from the Season 39 tournament, with the winner earning an entry into the Jeopardy! Masters tournament. Furthermore, Amy Schneider, the runner-up of that season's tournament, was also qualified into the Jeopardy! Masters tournament as a wildcard contestant, as chosen by producers.\n\nJeoparDAY!\nStarting from Season 38, a special day took place annually on March 30, the same date Jeopardy! originally premiered. The Season 38 JeoparDAY! event featured the first episode of the original NBC version of Jeopardy!. The Season 39 JeoparDAY! featured the first episode of the syndicated version of Jeopardy!, in which was Alex Trebek's first episode. The Season 40 JeoparDAY! event celebrated the show's 60th anniversary, which allowed the first 10,000 people who took the Jeopardy! Anytime Test donate $6, which totaled at $60,000.\n\nJeopardy! Honors\nStarting from Season 39, an annual awards ceremony event took place on the eve of the Tournament of Champions. It featured a blue carpet walk taking place from inside the Alex Trebek Stage at Sony Pictures Studios, and several awards, such as the Alex Trebek Person of the Year and the Most Valuable Player award. It also featured inductions into the Jeopardy! Hall of Fame. The Season 39 Jeopardy! Honors event was hosted by Buzzy Cohen and took place at the Sony Pictures Plaza. The Season 40 Jeopardy! Honors event was hosted by Ken Jennings and took place at the set of its sister show, Wheel of Fortune.\n\nOther regular tournaments\nTeen Tournament\nThe Jeopardy! Teen Tournament, which began in 1987, was an annual tournament in which 15 high school students between the ages of 13 and 17 competed in a ten-episode tournament structured similarly to the Tournament of Champions. The winner receives $100,000 and entry into the Tournament of Champions.\nOriginally the winner of the Teen Tournament was awarded one of the automatic qualifying spots in the Tournament of Champions that followed their victory. Jeopardy! discontinued this practice after the 2000 Tournament of Champions, with Fall 1999 champion Chacko George being the final Teen Tournament winner to receive the berth; however, each subsequent Teen Tournament winner from 2001 through 2005 was invited to compete in 2005’s Ultimate Tournament of Champions.\nAdditionally, Teen Tournament winners have also received merchandise at various points: the winners of the Fall 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2003 Teen Tournaments were awarded new cars, and the 2005 Teen Tournament winner received a computer package. At least one similar tournament was held in May 1967 during Fleming's run, with the winner (out of nine high school seniors who competed) receiving a $10,000 scholarship. The tournament was last held in Season 35.\n\nTeachers Tournament\nIn May 2011, to mark its 6,000th Trebek-era episode, Jeopardy! introduced its Teachers Tournament featuring 15 full-time teachers of students in kindergarten through grade 12. The tournament is similar in format to other tournaments, with the winner receiving a guaranteed minimum of $100,000 and an entry in to the Tournament of Champions. Second place wins $50,000 and third place wins $25,000 (again if their scores are higher, they win what they score), and players eliminated in the semifinals winning $10,000 and first round losers winning $5,000.\nThe tournament was not held in Season 37 (2020–21) because of pandemic restrictions, and in Season 38 (2021–22) was billed as the Professors Tournament, for collegiate professors. Mayim Bialik hosted the tournament in Season 38.\n\nCollege Championship\nIntroduced in 1989, the Jeopardy! College Championship featured 15 full-time undergraduate college students, with the format being similar to the other tournaments. The winner receives $100,000 and an entry into the Tournament of Champions.\nFrom 1997 until 2008, the College Championship was taped on various college campuses; an exception was the 2000-A College Championship as it was taped in Culver City.\nThe last syndicated College Championship was held in Season 36 (2019–20). It was not held in Season 37 (2020–21) due to travel restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. And in Season 38 (2021–22), it was reformatted and moved to primetime, billed as the National College Championship.\n\nSecond Chance Tournament\nOn October 17, 2022, Jeopardy! launched a Second Chance Tournament, featuring contestants who had high scores during a previous appearance but failed to win their games.\nEighteen contestants participated in the tournament, which spanned two consecutive weeks and 10 episodes. Each week was a separate competition, with three new contestants playing per day on Monday through Wednesday. The winners of these games advanced to a two-game match played on Thursday and Friday under the same scoring rules as in other tournaments, and the winner of this match received $35,000 and a slot in the Tournament of Champions.\nAnother such tournament was held at the start of Season 40, which spanned three consecutive weeks and 15 episodes with a total of 27 participants from Seasons 37 and 38. Each week was a separate competition, with three new contestants playing per day on Monday through Wednesday. The winners of these games advanced to a two-game match played on Thursday and Friday under the same scoring rules as in other tournaments, and the winner of this match received $35,000 and a slot in the Champions Wildcard Tournament.\nA third tournament began on December 19, 2023, spanning 20 consecutive episodes with a total of 36 participants from Season 39 and following the above format.\nCash awards were as follows:\n\nThird place, semifinals: $1,000 ($2,000 for Season 39 tournament)\nSecond place, semifinals: $2,000 ($3,000 for Season 39 tournament)\nThird place, finals: $10,000\nSecond place, finals: $20,000\nWinner, finals: $35,000 and Tournament of Champions / Champions Wildcard Tournament entry\nUnlike other tournaments, even if the scores exceed the minimum guarantees, finalists are only awarded the aforementioned cash prizes.\n\nChampions Wildcard Tournament\nOn October 2, 2023, Jeopardy! launched a Champions Wildcard Tournament, featuring 105 champions from Seasons 37 and 38 in addition to the three winners of the Second Chance Tournament that had concluded the previous week. The 108 participants are divided into four brackets of 27, each designated by one of the four playing card suits (spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts). Within each bracket, nine quarterfinal games are played, with three new contestants per game, and the winners advance to three semifinal games. Those three winners then play a two-game final match, using the same scoring rules as in other tournaments, and the winner advances to the Tournament of Champions.\nA second Champions Wildcard Tournament began on January 16, 2024, to feature 50 champions from Season 39 in addition to the four winners of the Second Chance Tournament that had concluded the previous day. The 54 participants are divided into two brackets of 27, with each bracket following the above rules. In order to reduce the total field for the first bracket to 27, two audio-only \"play-in\" games were held on January 12, broadcast on the audio streaming service TuneIn. A third such game was held on February 2 to set the field for the second bracket. All three games were hosted by Buzzy Cohen, with the winners advancing to the Champions Wildcard tournament.\nCash awards are as follows:\n\nEliminated in quarterfinals: $5,000\nEliminated in semifinals: $10,000\nThird place, finals: $25,000\nSecond place, finals: $50,000\nWinner, finals: $100,000 and Tournament of Champions entry\n\nCelebrity Jeopardy! and variants\nCelebrity Jeopardy!, whose inaugural episode aired on October 26, 1992, features notable individuals as contestants competing for charitable organizations of their choice (or, in the cases of public officials, relevant charities chosen by the Jeopardy! production staff). The tradition of special Jeopardy! matches featuring celebrity contestants goes back to the original NBC series, which featured appearances by such notables as Rod Serling, Bill Cullen, Art James, and Peter Marshall. On the Trebek version, Celebrity Jeopardy! traditionally had been broadcast annually as a weeklong event in the 1990s before becoming increasingly sparse and irregular in the 2000s and 2010s. Unlike the regular games in which a player finishing the Double Jeopardy! round with a zero or negative score is disqualified from playing the Final Jeopardy! round, Celebrity Jeopardy! instead grants players a nominal score of $1,000 with which to wager for the final round. Since its debut, Celebrity Jeopardy! has featured over 200 celebrity contestants. The most recent syndicated episodes under the title Celebrity Jeopardy! aired in May 2015; the title was later revived for an ABC network version as discussed below.\n\nMillion Dollar Celebrity Invitational\nThe Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational began on September 17, 2009, and subsequent games aired on the third Thursday of every month from September 2009 to April 2010, with an additional quarter-final on the third Friday of April 2010. The semi-final and final rounds aired during the first full week of May 2010. A total of 27 celebrities—three per game for the nine semifinal episodes—competed for a grand prize of $1,000,000 for their charity. The winners of each qualifying game returned in May 2010 for three semi-final games. However, Andy Richter, who won his quarterfinal game, was unable to make semifinal taping due to scheduling conflicts. Isaac Mizrahi replaced Richter as a wild card, using standard wild card rules. The semi-final winners competed in a two-day total point final to determine the grand champion in a format similar to other annual Jeopardy! tournaments. The winner of each qualifying game won a minimum of $50,000 for their charity (more if their post-Final Jeopardy! score exceeded $50,000), and the two runners-up each received $25,000 for their charities. Jane Curtin, Michael McKean, and Cheech Marin advanced to the two-game final, and McKean won the tournament, earning $1 million for his charity, the International Myeloma Foundation.\n\nPower Players Week\nPower Players Week began on November 17, 1997, and features personalities in journalism and politics. And because of this, episodes are always taped at DAR Constitution Hall. After the inaugural event, the next three Power Players Weeks were aired in May 2004 (Season 20); May 2012 (Season 28); and most recently, May 2016 (Season 32).\n\nPrimetime celebrity tournaments\nIn May 2022, ABC announced a one-hour network prime time version of Celebrity Jeopardy! to air Sunday nights beginning fall 2022, with the premiere date subsequently scheduled for September 25. Executive producer Michael Davies then confirmed in July that Mayim Bialik would host the primetime series. Rather than airing two games in a one-hour timeslot as with previous primetime versions, each edition features a single hour-long game, with two main changes: first, the Jeopardy! round uses $100 to $500 values and the Double Jeopardy! round uses $200 to $1,000 values (last used in 2001); second, a Triple Jeopardy! round is added, featuring tripled clue values ranging from $300 to $1,500 and three hidden Daily Double clues. The season had 27 players competing in a 13-week tournament with nine quarterfinals, three semifinals, and one final. The winner receives $1,000,000 for their charity and an entry into the Tournament of Champions.\nBeginning with the fall 2023 season, Ken Jennings replaced Bialik as host of Celebrity Jeopardy! due to Bialik's withdrawal in connection with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.\n\nSaturday Night Live parodies\nCelebrity Jeopardy! has repeatedly been parodied in a recurring sketch on Saturday Night Live, with Will Ferrell acting as Alex Trebek (with the real Alex Trebek making a cameo appearance in Ferrell's final sketch as a regular cast member). Comic foils to Alex Trebek (Ferrell) included Norm Macdonald as Burt Reynolds and Darrell Hammond as Sean Connery. Other parodies have been produced, including \"Black Jeopardy!\" featuring Kenan Thompson acting as a host.\n\nOther recurring events\nWhen season 16 began in September 1999, the show inaugurated Kids Week, a week of five special non-tournament games featuring children aged 10 to 12. Three new contestants compete each day. The winners of each game keep whatever they win, with minimum guarantees of $15,000. The second- and third-place contestants receive consolation prizes of $2,000 and $1,000, respectively. The first four times the event was held, the player who had the highest winning score during the week was also awarded a bonus of $5,000. The last Kids Week episodes aired in 2014.\n\nSpecial events\nABC tournaments\nFive Jeopardy! events have been scheduled outside the show's usual syndication run, all on ABC: Super Jeopardy! aired in 1990, the Greatest of All Time aired in 2020, the National College Championship aired in February 2022, the aforementioned Celebrity Jeopardy! primetime tournament aired from September 2022 to February 2023 and September 2023 to January 2024, and Jeopardy! Masters airing in May 2023 and May 2024. The ABC Owned Television Stations group has been the lead broadcaster of the syndicated version for most of its run.\n\nSuper Jeopardy!\nSuper Jeopardy! was a special summer series that premiered on June 16, 1990, on ABC. It was the first attempt during Alex Trebek's hosting run to gather the series' best contestants up to that date.\nA total of thirty-six contestants competed in Super Jeopardy!. Thirty-five of them were some of the biggest winners that had competed in the first six years of the syndicated Jeopardy! series that had aired to that point. The other spot was reserved for Burns Cameron, who had appeared on the original daytime series in 1965 and won a total of $11,110 in regular and tournament play to set that series' all-time record.\nSuper Jeopardy! featured four contestants per episode in the quarterfinal games, while subsequent rounds were played with the usual three players. Each game was played for points instead of money, and the clue values were adjusted accordingly; correct responses were worth 200–1000 points in the Jeopardy! round and 500–2500 points in Double Jeopardy!; this was the only time in the show's history that the second round values were not double those of the first round.\nAny contestant eliminated in the quarterfinal round won $5,000 and the contestants eliminated in the semifinal round won $10,000.\nThe finals of the tournament aired on September 8, 1990, and pitted 1987 Tournament of Champions winner Bob Verini and finalist Dave Traini against 1988 Tournament of Champions quarterfinalist and four-day champion Bruce Seymour in a one-day final match where the winner received $250,000. Traini finished in negative territory and could not play Final Jeopardy!, which meant he automatically finished third and won $25,000. Seymour, leading entering Final Jeopardy!, correctly answered the final clue and won the top prize. Verini, who did not answer correctly, finished second and won $50,000.\n\nThe Greatest of All Time\nAnnounced on November 18, 2019, and aired beginning January 7, 2020, the tournament featured contestants Ken Jennings, Brad Rutter, and James Holzhauer competing in a tournament with a top prize of $1 million. The tournament was structured as first-to-three-wins format over a series of one-hour episodes, with each episode a stand-alone match consisting of two back-to-back complete Jeopardy! games, using points instead of dollars. Ken Jennings won the tournament in four matches, with James Holzhauer winning one match and Brad Rutter winning none. As the tournament winner, Jennings was named \"The Greatest of All Time\", won the $1 million prize, and reclaimed the top spot for most money won on a game show. Rutter and Holzhauer, the two runners-up, received $250,000 each.\n\nNational College Championship\nThe Jeopardy! National College Championship premiered on ABC on February 8, 2022. Unlike Super Jeopardy! and The Greatest of All Time, this tournament is an annual event. There are a few differences from the previous syndicated tournament: The format was changed to expand the pool to 36 contestants, and there are twelve quarterfinal matches and four semifinals, with no wild cards. The semifinalist who finishes in fourth place receives $35,000 and an entry into the Second Chance Tournament. The winner takes home $250,000 and an entry into the Tournament of Champions, while the runners-up receive $100,000 and $50,000 for second and third place, respectively. Eliminated semifinalists receive $20,000 while eliminated quarterfinalists receive $10,000.\n\nJeopardy! Masters\nJeopardy! Masters premiered on ABC on May 8, 2023, featuring six top Jeopardy! players competing for a grand prize of $500,000. The clues are valued in points instead of the traditional dollar amounts. The tournament was structured as a \"Champions League-style\" format, with the winner of each game receiving three match points, the second-place contestant receiving one match point, and the third-place contestant receiving zero match points. In the event of match point ties, they are broken by the following criteria in this order: the number of games won, the total number of correct responses for that stage of the competition (including Final Jeopardy!), the cumulative total score excluding Final Jeopardy! and Daily Double wagers, and the cumulative total score excluding only Final Jeopardy! wagers. The bottom two contestants with the lowest match points at the end of the quarterfinals are eliminated and receive $75,000 for fifth place and $50,000 for sixth place. The match point values are reset during the semifinals, at which the contestant with the lowest match points receives the $100,000 fourth-place prize. In the finals, the winner is determined based on the two-game total point values, with second place receiving $250,000 and third place receiving $150,000. Additionally, all three finalists will receive entry into the next Masters tournament.\n\nOther all-time best tournaments\n10th Anniversary Tournament\nFrom November 29 to December 3, 1993, Jeopardy! held a special one-week 10th Anniversary Tournament to honor the Trebek version's 10th season, which featured one Tournament of Champions-qualified contestant from each of the nine completed seasons to that point. Eight contestants were drawn at random and were revealed over the course of four episodes. After Tom Nosek won the 1993 Tournament of Champions, he received the ninth position.\nContestants competed for a winner's prize of a combined two-day final score total plus a $25,000 bonus. The event resembled the show's regular tournaments sans a quarterfinal round, with three semifinal matches to determine three finalists, who then competed against each other in a two-game total point match. Eliminated semifinalists received consolation prizes of $5,000, while the second runner-up received a guaranteed minimum of $7,500, the first runner-up received a guaranteed minimum of $10,000, and the winner earned his or her two-game total plus a $25,000 bonus. Frank Spangenberg won the tournament with a two-game score of $16,800 plus a $25,000 bonus for a total of $41,800. Tom Nosek finished second with $13,600, while Leslie Frates won the $7,500 guaranteed third place prize, which exceeded her score of $4,499.\n\nMillion Dollar Masters\nIn May 2002, to commemorate the Trebek version's 4,000th episode, Jeopardy! invited fifteen former champions to participate in a special tournament called the Million Dollar Masters, with a guaranteed seven-figure payday for the winner. The tournament was held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City and featured the same two-week, three-round format as the traditional tournaments on Jeopardy! The event's first round ran from May 1 to May 7, and the three semifinal matches aired from May 8–10. The three finalists were Eric Newhouse, who won the 1989 Teen Tournament and the special 1998 Teen Reunion Tournament; Brad Rutter, a five-time champion from 2000 who won the Tournament of Champions held earlier in the 2001–02 season; and Bob Verini, the winner of the 1987 Tournament of Champions and the runner-up in the 1990 Super Jeopardy! tournament. The tournament ended with Rutter winning the $1,000,000 grand prize, Newhouse coming in second and winning $100,000, and Verini placing third and winning $50,000.\n\nUltimate Tournament of Champions\nThe Ultimate Tournament of Champions, a special 15-week single-elimination tournament involving a total of 145 contestants, began airing on February 9, 2005, and concluded on May 25, 2005, covering 76 shows in total. Ken Jennings, who had just completed his record-setting run as champion three months before the tournament started, was invited to compete in the tournament; he was automatically awarded a spot in the final match. The other 144 spots in the tournament were given to past five-time champions and past winners of the Tournament of Champions, College Championship, and Teen Tournament, including those who had won in the current season to that point. The overall winner of the tournament would receive a cash prize of $2 million, with the first runner-up receiving an additional $500,000 and the second an additional $250,000.\nRound 1 featured 135 of the 144 contestants competing to advance to Round 2. The remaining nine contestants received byes into Round 2.\nRound 2 featured the 18 winners from Round 1 competing to advance to the quarterfinals.\nChuck Forrest, the 1986 Tournament of Champions winner and setter of several show records during his original run as champion, was given one of the nine automatic quarterfinal spots. Three other byes were given to the finalists from the Million Dollar Masters tournament held during the 2002–2003 season, with Bob Verini, Eric Newhouse, and Brad Rutter receiving the honors. Of the five remaining spots, one was given to the first champion to win more than five games (Sean Ryan, six), while another one was given to the champion who recorded the longest winning streak prior to Jennings’ reign (Tom Walsh, seven wins). Of the three remaining byes, they were given out based on total winnings. Frank Spangenberg earned his bye due in part to his being the first contestant to surpass $100,000 in earnings in regular play, while Brian Weikle earned his bye for being the highest-earning champion in regular play prior to the removal of the five-day limit. The last bye was given to Robin Carroll, who became the highest-winning female champion in show history to that date following victories in her Tournament of Champions as well as a subsequent International Tournament of Champions; she held the show’s overall winnings mark as well until Rutter won the Million Dollar Masters in 2002.\nEach match was conducted as a single game affair until the tournament reached the semifinal round. The six remaining contestants competed in two two-game, cumulative score contests to determine who would face Jennings in the finals. The first semifinal was won by 1992 Tournament of Champions finalist Jerome Vered, who defeated Frank Spangenberg and 2000 College Champion Pam Mueller. Brad Rutter won the other semifinal over 1993 champion John Cuthbertson and 2004 champion Chris Miller.\nRutter, Vered, and Jennings then competed in a three-game cumulative score final match for the top prize. Rutter, who had the highest total in all three of the games, finished with $62,000 and won the $2,000,000 prize. Jennings finished second with $34,599 and collected $500,000, while Vered finished third with $20,600, and took home $250,000. All in all, the tournament's contestants won a combined grand total of $5,604,413.\n\nBattle of the Decades\nIn 2014, Jeopardy! held a special 5-week tournament billed as the Battle of the Decades to commemorate the Trebek version's 30th season, involving a total of 45 former champions from each of the first 29 completed seasons to that point, and divided into three decades (1984–1993, 1994–2003, and 2004–2013). The winner of the tournament would receive a cash prize of $1 million.\nThere were five matches from each decade to decide who advances to the quarterfinals. The first decade was aired February 3 to 7, 2014, with the second decade airing March 3 to 7, 2014; and the third aired from March 31 to April 4, 2014.\nThe quarterfinal matches aired May 5–9, 2014; and the semifinals and finals aired May 12–16, 2014. Ken Jennings, Brad Rutter, and Roger Craig competed in the two-day cumulative score final match for the championship. Rutter won the tournament and took home the $1,000,000 prize. Jennings finished as the first runner-up with $100,000, while Craig was the second runner-up taking home $50,000.\n\nAll-Star Games\nThe Jeopardy! All-Star Games conducted in 2019 feature a team format in which eighteen champions are split up into six groups of three. The six teams are captained by Jennings, Rutter, Colby Burnett, Buzzy Cohen, Austin Rogers and Julia Collins, who each drafted two players from a pool that included Leonard Cooper, Roger Craig, Jennifer Giles, Ben Ingram, Matt Jackson, Alex Jacob, Larissa Kelly, Alan Lin, David Madden, Pam Mueller, Monica Thieu, and Seth Wilson. The draft was streamed live over Facebook on September 22, 2018, with the games themselves airing from February 20 to March 5, 2019. A concurrent fantasy sweepstakes awarded a prize to a home viewer who selected the highest-grossing three individual contestants in the tournament. Team Colby consisted of Burnett, Mueller and Lin, Team Buzzy consisted of Cohen, Jacob, and Giles, Team Julia consisted of Collins, Ingram, and Wilson, Team Ken consisted of Jennings, Jackson, and Thieu; Team Austin consisted of Rogers, Craig, and Cooper, and Team Brad consisted of Rutter, Kelly, and Madden. Each match was played as a relay; one player on each team played a different round of the game, with the winning trio splitting a $1,000,000 prize. Rutter's team won the contest, with Jennings's team finishing second and splitting $300,000; Burnett's team (the wild card entry) came in third, splitting $100,000.\n\nReunion tournaments\nA special one-week Teen Reunion Tournament held in November 1998 invited back 12 former Teen Tournament contestants from that event's first three installments (1987–1989) to compete in a single-elimination tournament. The three highest-scoring winners of the four semifinal matches competed in a one-game final where the champion received $50,000; the second and third-place players received $15,000 and $10,000, respectively. The semifinal winner who did not participate in the finals received $7,500, and the other contestants each received $5,000. The tournament was won by Eric Newhouse, who had previously won the 1989 Teen Tournament.\nThe Jeopardy! Kids Week Reunion brought back 15 Kids Week alumni from the 1999 and 2000 Kids Week games to compete for a minimum $25,000 each game. The special week of programming was taped on August 12, 2008, and was broadcast from September 15 to 19, 2008.\nA December 2022 announcement detailed a second teen reunion tournament, billed as the High School Reunion Tournament. 27 contestants, all from the two Season 35 tournaments (2018–19), will participate in a three-week tournament, with a $100,000 prize and the winner competing in the 2023 Tournament of Champions, the first time a Teen Tournament player has been invited to a Tournament of Champions since 2005's Ultimate Tournament of Champions. Mayim Bialik will host the tournament, which will consist of 9 quarterfinal games, 3 semifinal games, and a 2-game total-point final, with no wild cards.\n\nJeopardy! Invitational Tournament\nThe Jeopardy! Invitational Tournament began on March 20, 2024, with a field of 27 past champions and favorite contestants. The quarterfinal and semifinal rounds followed the same structure as the Champions Wildcard Tournament, but the finals were decided by the first contestant to win two games. Prize amounts were the same as for Champions Wildcard; in addition, the champion advanced to the 2024 Jeopardy! Masters Tournament. It was also announced that one of the other two finalists is also invited to the 2024 Jeopardy! Masters Tournament as a wildcard contestant, chosen by the producers.\n\nIBM Challenge\nA special three day exhibition match, Jeopardy!'s IBM Challenge, aired February 14 to 16, 2011, and featured IBM's Watson computer facing off against Jennings and Rutter in two games, played over three shows. This was the first man-vs.-machine competition in Jeopardy!'s history. Watson locked up the first game and the match to win the grand prize of $1 million, which IBM divided between two charities (World Vision International and World Community Grid). Jennings, who won $300,000 for second place, and Rutter, who won the $200,000 third-place prize, both pledged to donate half of their total winnings to their respective charities (Ken's charity was VillageReach, while Brad's was the Lancaster County Community Foundation). The competition brought the show its highest ratings since the Ultimate Tournament of Champions.\n\nInternational Tournaments\nOne-week tournaments featuring champions from each of the international versions of Jeopardy! were held in 1996, 1997, and 2001. Each of the countries that aired their own version of the show in those years could nominate a contestant. The format was identical to the semifinals and finals of the Tournament of Champions, save for the inaugural 1996 tournament, which was conducted over four days and featured a one-game final match. The 1996 tournament took place in the normal Jeopardy! studio in California, while the 1997 tournament took place on the set of the Swedish version of the program in Stockholm and the 2001 tournament was held at the Las Vegas Hilton in Nevada.\nIn the first two tournaments, the winner was awarded $25,000, while the first and second runners-up received $10,000 and $7,500 respectively, with semifinalists receiving $5,000. For the 2001 tournament, the winner's prize was doubled to $50,000, while the two runners-up received $15,000 and $10,000.\nThe 1996 international tournament was titled the Olympic Games Tournament, as part of promotional tie-ins for the 1996 Summer Olympics being conducted across Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune. It was won by Ulf Jensen from Sweden, while Michael Daunt from Canada won the second and Robin Carroll from the United States won the third. The second tournament actually featured two contestants from the American series, with the United States represented by 1996 three-time champion Gay Mollette; Daunt, who placed third in the Tournament of Champions earlier in the 1996–97 season, was one of many Canadians to compete on Jeopardy! over the years as Canada does not have its own version of the program.\n\nSee also\nList of notable Jeopardy! contestants\nStrategies and skills of Jeopardy! champions\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial Jeopardy! website"

        "content": "A dystopia (from Ancient Greek  δυσ (dus) 'bad' and  τόπος (tópos) 'place'), also called a cacotopia or anti-utopia, is a community or society that is extremely bad or frightening. It is often treated as an antonym of utopia, a term that was coined by Sir Thomas More and figures as the title of his best known work, published in 1516, which created a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime, violence, and poverty. The relationship between utopia and dystopia is in actuality, not one of simple opposition, as many dystopias claim to be utopias and vice versa.\nDystopias are often characterized by fear or distress, tyrannical governments, environmental disaster, or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Themes typical of a dystopian society include: complete control over the people in a society through the usage of propaganda and police state tactics, heavy censoring of information or denial of free thought, worshiping an unattainable goal, the complete loss of individuality, and heavy enforcement of conformity. Despite certain overlaps, dystopian fiction is distinct from post-apocalyptic fiction, and an undesirable society is not necessarily dystopian. Dystopian societies appear in many fictional works and artistic representations, particularly in historical fiction, such as A Tale of Two Cities (1859) by Charles Dickens, Quo Vadis? by Henryk Sienkiewicz, and A Man for All Seasons (1960) by Robert Bolt, stories set in the alternate history timelines, like Robert Harris' Fatherland (1992), or in the future. Famous examples set in the future included Robert Hugh Benson's Lord of the World (1907), Yevgeny Zamyatin's We (1920), Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932), George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (1953). Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to society, environment, politics, economics, religion, psychology, ethics, science, or technology. Some authors use the term to refer to existing societies, many of which are, or have been, totalitarian states or societies in an advanced state of collapse. Dystopias, through an exaggerated worst-case scenario, often make a criticism about a current trend, societal norm, or political system.\n\nEtymology\n\"Dustopia\", the original spelling of \"dystopia\", first appeared in Lewis Henry Younge's Utopia: or Apollo's Golden Days in 1747. Additionally, dystopia was used as an antonym for utopia by John Stuart Mill in one of his 1868 Parliamentary Speeches (Hansard Commons) by adding the prefix \"dys\" (Ancient Greek: δυσ- \"bad\") to \"topia\", reinterpreting the initial \"u\" as the prefix \"eu\" (Ancient Greek: ευ- \"good\") instead of \"ou\" (Ancient Greek: οὐ \"not\"). It was used to denounce the government's Irish land policy: \"It is, perhaps, too complimentary to call them Utopians, they ought rather to be called dys-topians, or caco-topians. What is commonly called Utopian is something too good to be practicable; but what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable\".\nDecades before the first documented use of the word \"dystopia\" was \"cacotopia\"/\"kakotopia\" (using Ancient Greek: κακόs, \"bad, wicked\") originally proposed in 1818 by Jeremy Bentham, \"As a match for utopia (or the imagined seat of the best government) suppose a cacotopia (or the imagined seat of the worst government) discovered and described\". Though dystopia became the more popular term, cacotopia finds occasional use; Anthony Burgess, author of A Clockwork Orange (1962), said it was a better fit for Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four because \"it sounds worse than dystopia\".\n\nTheory\nSome scholars, such as Gregory Claeys and Lyman Tower Sargent, make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias. For example, Claeys and Sargent define literary dystopias as societies imagined as substantially worse than the society in which the author writes. Some of these are anti-utopias, which criticise attempts to implement various concepts of utopia. In the most comprehensive treatment of the literary and real expressions of the concept, Dystopia: A Natural History, Claeys offers a historical approach to these definitions. Here the tradition is traced from early reactions to the French Revolution. Its commonly anti-collectivist character is stressed, and the addition of other themes—the dangers of science and technology, of social inequality, of corporate dictatorship, of nuclear war—are also traced. A psychological approach is also favored here, with the principle of fear being identified with despotic forms of rule, carried forward from the history of political thought, and group psychology introduced as a means of understanding the relationship between utopia and dystopia. Andrew Norton-Schwartzbard noted that \"written many centuries before the concept \"dystopia\" existed, Dante's Inferno in fact includes most of the typical characteristics associated with this genre – even if placed in a religious framework rather than in the future of the mundane world, as modern dystopias tend to be\". In the same vein, Vicente Angeloti remarked that \"George Orwell's emblematic phrase, a boot stamping on a human face – forever, would aptly describe the situation of the denizens in Dante's Hell. Conversely, Dante's famous inscription Abandon all hope, ye who enter here would have been equally appropriate if placed at the entrance to Orwell's \"Ministry of Love\" and its notorious \"Room 101\".\n\nSociety\nDystopias typically reflect contemporary sociopolitical realities and extrapolate worst-case scenarios as warnings for necessary social change or caution. Dystopian fictions invariably reflect the concerns and fears of their creators' contemporaneous culture. Due to this, they can be considered a subject of social studies. In dystopias, citizens may live in a dehumanized state, be under constant surveillance, or have a fear of the outside world. In the film What Happened to Monday the protagonists (identical septuplet sisters) risk their lives by taking turns onto the outside world because of a one-child policy place in this futuristic dystopian society.\nIn a 1967 study, Frank Kermode suggests that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode. Christopher Schmidt notes that, while the world goes to waste for future generations, people distract themselves from disaster by passively watching it as entertainment.\nIn the 2010s, there was a surge of popular dystopian young adult literature and blockbuster films. Some have commented on this trend, saying that \"it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism\". Cultural theorist and critic Mark Fisher identified the phrase as encompassing the theory of capitalist realism—the perceived \"widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it\"—and used the above quote as the title to the opening chapter of his book, Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?. In the book, he also refers to dystopian film such as Children of Men (originally a novel by P. D. James) to illustrate what he describes as the \"slow cancellation of the future\". Theo James, an actor in Divergent (originally a novel by Veronica Roth), explains that \"young people in particular have such a fascination with this kind of story [...] It's becoming part of the consciousness. You grow up in a world where it's part of the conversation all the time – the statistics of our planet warming up. The environment is changing. The weather is different. These are things that are very visceral and very obvious, and they make you question the future, and how we will survive. It's so much a part of everyday life that young people inevitably – consciously or not – are questioning their futures and how the Earth will be. I certainly do. I wonder what kind of world my children's kids will live in.\"\nThe entire substantial sub-genre of alternative history works depicting a world in which Nazi Germany won the Second World War can be considered as dystopias. So can other works of Alternative History, in which a historical turning point led to a manifestly repressive world. For example, the 2004 mockumentary C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America, and Ben Winters' Underground Airlines, in which slavery in the United States continues to the present, with \"electronic slave auctions\" carried out via the Internet and slaves controlled by electronic devices implanted in their spines, or Keith Roberts Pavane in which 20th Century Britain is ruled by a Catholic theocracy and the Inquisition is actively torturing and burning \"heretics\".\n\nCommon themes\nPolitics\nIn When the Sleeper Wakes, H. G. Wells depicted the governing class as hedonistic and shallow. George Orwell contrasted Wells's world to that depicted in Jack London's The Iron Heel, where the dystopian rulers are brutal and dedicated to the point of fanaticism, which Orwell considered more plausible.\nThe political principles at the root of fictional utopias (or \"perfect worlds\") are idealistic in principle and result in positive consequences for the inhabitants; the political principles on which fictional dystopias are based, while often based on utopian ideals, result in negative consequences for inhabitants because of at least one fatal flaw.\nDystopias are often filled with pessimistic views of the ruling class or a government that is brutal or uncaring, ruling with an \"iron fist\". Dystopian governments are sometimes ruled by a fascist or communist regime or dictator. These dystopian government establishments often have protagonists or groups that lead a \"resistance\" to enact change within their society, as is seen in Alan Moore's V for Vendetta.\nDystopian political situations are depicted in novels such as We, Parable of the Sower, Darkness at Noon, Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brave New World, The Handmaid's Tale, The Hunger Games, Divergent and Fahrenheit 451 and such films as Metropolis, Brazil (1985), Battle Royale, FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions, Soylent Green, The Purge: Election Year, Logan's Run, and The Running Man (1987).. An earlier example is Jules Verne's The Begum's Millions with its depiction of Stahlstadt (Steel City), a vast industrial and mining complex, which is totally devoted to the production of ever more powerful and destructive weapons, and which is ruled by the dictatorial and totally ruthless Prof. Schultze – a militarist and racist who dreams of world conquest and as the first step plots the complete destruction of the nearby Ville-France, a utopian model city constructed and maintained with public health as its government's primary concern.\n\nEconomics\nThe economic structures of dystopian societies in literature and other media have many variations, as the economy often relates directly to the elements that the writer is depicting as the source of the oppression. There are several archetypes that such societies tend to follow. A theme is the dichotomy of planned economies versus free market economies, a conflict which is found in such works as Ayn Rand's Anthem and Henry Kuttner's short story \"The Iron Standard\". Another example of this is reflected in Norman Jewison's 1975 film Rollerball (1975).\nSome dystopias, such as that of Nineteen Eighty-Four, feature black markets with goods that are dangerous and difficult to obtain or the characters may be at the mercy of the state-controlled economy. Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano depicts a dystopia in which the centrally controlled economic system has indeed made material abundance plentiful but deprived the mass of humanity of meaningful labor; virtually all work is menial, unsatisfying and only a small number of the small group that achieves education is admitted to the elite and its work. In Tanith Lee's Don't Bite the Sun, there is no want of any kind – only unabashed consumption and hedonism, leading the protagonist to begin looking for a deeper meaning to existence. Even in dystopias where the economic system is not the source of the society's flaws, as in Brave New World, the state often controls the economy; a character, reacting with horror to the suggestion of not being part of the social body, cites as a reason that works for everyone else.\nOther works feature extensive privatization and corporatism; both consequences of capitalism, where privately owned and unaccountable large corporations have replaced the government in setting policy and making decisions. They manipulate, infiltrate, control, bribe, are contracted by and function as government. This is seen in the novels Jennifer Government and Oryx and Crake and the movies Alien, Avatar, RoboCop, Visioneers, Idiocracy, Soylent Green, WALL-E and Rollerball. Corporate republics are common in the cyberpunk genre, as in Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash and Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (as well as the film Blade Runner, influenced by and based upon Dick's novel).\n\nClass\nDystopian fiction frequently draws stark contrasts between the privileges of the ruling class and the dreary existence of the working class. In the 1931 novel Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, a class system is prenatally determined with Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons, with the lower classes having reduced brain function and special conditioning to make them satisfied with their position in life. Outside of this society there also exist several human settlements that exist in the conventional way but which the World Government describes as \"savages\".\nIn George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the dystopian society described within has a tiered class structure with the ruling elite \"Inner Party\" at the top, the \"Outer Party\" below them functioning as a type of middle-class with minor privileges, and the working-class \"Proles\" (short for proletariat) at the bottom of the hierarchy with few rights, yet making up the vast majority of the population.\nIn Ypsilon Minus by Herbert W. Franke, people are divided into numerous alphabetically ranked groups.\nIn the film Elysium, the majority of Earth's population on the surface lives in poverty with little access to health care and are subject to worker exploitation and police brutality, while the wealthy live above the Earth in luxury with access to technologies that cure all diseases, reverse aging, and regenerate body parts.\nWritten a century earlier, the future society depicted in H. G. Wells' The Time Machine had started in a similar way to Elysium – the workers consigned to living and working in underground tunnels while the wealthy live on a surface made into an enormous beautiful garden. But over a long time period, the roles were eventually reversed – the rich degenerated and became a decadent \"livestock\" regularly caught and eaten by the underground cannibal Morlocks.\n\nFamily\nSome fictional dystopias, such as Brave New World and Fahrenheit 451, have eradicated the family and kept it from re-establishing itself as a social institution. In Brave New World, where children are reproduced artificially, the concepts of \"mother\" and \"father\" are considered obscene.  In some novels, such as We, the state is hostile to motherhood, as a pregnant woman from One State is in revolt.\n\nReligion\nIn dystopias, religious groups may play the role of oppressed or oppressor. One of the earliest examples is Robert Hugh Benson's Lord of the World, about a futuristic world where Marxists and Freemasons led by the Antichrist have taken over the world and the only remaining source of dissent is a tiny and persecuted Catholic minority. In Brave New World the establishment of the state included lopping off the tops of all crosses (as symbols of Christianity) to make them \"T\"s (as symbols of Henry Ford's Model T). In C. S. Lewis's That Hideous Strength the leaders of the fictional National Institute of Coordinated Experiments, a joint venture of academia and government to promote an anti-traditionalist social agenda, are contemptuous of religion and require initiates to desecrate Christian symbols.  Margaret Atwood's novel The Handmaid's Tale takes place in a future United States under a Christian-based theocratic regime.\n\nIdentity\nIn the Russian novel We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, first published in 1921, people are permitted to live out of public view twice a week for one hour and are only referred to by numbers instead of names. The latter feature also appears in the film THX 1138. In some dystopian works, such as Kurt Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron, society forces individuals to conform to radical egalitarian social norms that discourage or suppress accomplishment or even competence as forms of inequality. Complete conformity and suppression of individuality (to the point of acting in unison) is also depicted in Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time.\n\nViolence\nViolence is prevalent in many dystopias, often in the form of war, but also in urban crimes led by (predominately teenage) gangs (e.g. A Clockwork Orange), or rampant crime met by blood sports (e.g. Battle Royale, The Running Man, The Hunger Games, Divergent, and The Purge). It is also explained in Suzanne Berne's essay \"Ground Zero\", where she explains her experience of the aftermath of 11 September 2001.\n\nNature\nFictional dystopias are commonly urban and frequently isolate their characters from all contact with the natural world. Sometimes they require their characters to avoid nature, as when walks are regarded as dangerously anti-social in Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, as well as within Bradbury's short story \"The Pedestrian\".  In That Hideous Strength, science coordinated by government is directed toward the control of nature and the elimination of natural human instincts.  In Brave New World, the lower class is conditioned to be afraid of nature but also to visit the countryside and consume transport and games to promote economic activity. Lois Lowry's \"The Giver\" shows a society where technology and the desire to create a utopia has led humanity to enforce climate control on the environment, as well as to eliminate many undomesticated species and to provide psychological and pharmaceutical repellent against human instincts. E. M. Forster's \"The Machine Stops\" depicts a highly changed global environment which forces people to live underground due to an atmospheric contamination. As Angel Galdon-Rodriguez points out, this sort of isolation caused by external toxic hazard is later used by Hugh Howey in his series of dystopias of the Silo Series.\nExcessive pollution that destroys nature is common in many dystopian films, such as The Matrix, RoboCop, WALL-E, April and the Extraordinary World and Soylent Green, as well as in videogames like Half-Life 2. A few \"green\" fictional dystopias do exist, such as in Michael Carson's short story \"The Punishment of Luxury\", and Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker. The latter is set in the aftermath of nuclear war, \"a post-nuclear holocaust Kent, where technology has reduced to the level of the Iron Age\".\n\nScience and technology\nContrary to the technologically utopian claims, which view technology as a beneficial addition to all aspects of humanity, technological dystopia concerns itself with and focuses largely (but not always) on the negative effects caused by new technology.\n\nTechnologies reflect and encourage the worst aspects of human nature.\nJaron Lanier, a digital pioneer, has become a technological dystopian: \"I think it's a way of interpreting technology in which people forgot taking responsibility.\" \"'Oh, it's the computer that did it, not me.' 'There's no more middle class? Oh, it's not me. The computer did it'\" This quote explains that people begin to not only blame the technology for the changes in lifestyle but also believe that technology is an omnipotence. It also points to a technological determinist perspective in terms of reification.\nTechnologies harm our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.\nA decrease in communication within family members and friend groups due to increased time in technology use. Virtual space misleadingly heightens the impact of real presence; people resort to technological medium for communication nowadays.\nTechnologies reinforce hierarchies – concentrate knowledge and skills; increase surveillance and erode privacy; widen inequalities of power and wealth; giving up control to machines.\nDouglas Rushkoff, a technological utopian, states in his article that the professional designers \"re-mystified\" the computer so it wasn't so readable anymore; users had to depend on the special programs built into the software that was incomprehensible for normal users.\nNew technologies are sometimes regressive (worse than previous technologies).\nThe unforeseen impacts of technology are negative.\n\"The most common way is that there's some magic artificial intelligence in the sky or in the cloud or something that knows how to translate, and what a wonderful thing that this is available for free. But there's another way to look at it, which is the technically true way: You gather a ton of information from real live translators who have translated phrases… It's huge but very much like Facebook, it's selling people back to themselves… [With translation] you're producing this result that looks magical but in the meantime, the original translators aren't paid for their work… You're actually shrinking the economy.\"\nMore efficiency and choices can harm our quality of life (by causing stress, destroying jobs, making us more materialistic).\nIn his article \"Prest-o! Change-o!\", technological dystopian James Gleick mentions the remote control being the classic example of technology that does not solve the problem \"it is meant to solve\". Gleick quotes Edward Tenner, a historian of technology, that the ability and ease of switching channels by the remote control serves to increase distraction for the viewer. Then it is only expected that people will become more dissatisfied with the channel they are watching.\nNew technologies can solve problems of old technologies or just create new problems.\nThe remote control example explains this claim as well, for the increase in laziness and dissatisfaction levels was clearly not a problem in times without the remote control. He also takes social psychologist Robert Levine's example of Indonesians \"'whose main entertainment consists of watching the same few plays and dances, month after month, year after year,' and with Nepalese Sherpas who eat the same meals of potatoes and tea through their entire lives. The Indonesians and Sherpas are perfectly satisfied\". Because of the invention of the remote control, it merely created more problems.\nTechnologies destroy nature (harming human health and the environment).\nThe need for business replaced community and the \"story online\" replaced people as the \"soul of the Net\". Because information was now able to be bought and sold, there was not as much communication taking place.\n\nIn pop culture\nDystopian themes are in many television shows and video games such as Cyberpunk 2077, The Hunger Games, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, Blade Runner 2049, Elysium and Titanfall.\n\nSee also\nAlternate history\nHorror fiction\nApocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction\nBiopunk\nDigital dystopia\nDissident\nInner emigration\nKafkaesque\nList of dystopian comics\nList of dystopian films\nList of dystopian literature\nList of dystopian works\nLovecraftian horror\nPlutocracy\nPolice state\nSelf-fulfilling prophecy\nSocial science fiction\nSocietal collapse\nSoft science fiction\n\nReferences\nSee also Gregory Claeys. \"When Does Utopianism Produce Dystopia?\" in: Zsolt Czigányik, ed. \nUtopian Horizons.

        "last_edit_time": "29 December 2018, 17:55 (UTC)",
        "content": "Bird Box is a 2014 post-apocalyptic horror novel and the debut novel by American writer and singer Josh Malerman. The book was first published in the United Kingdom on March 27, 2014, through Harper Voyager and in the United States on May 13, 2014, through Ecco Press. The book follows a woman who must find a way to guide herself and her children to safety despite the potential threat from an unseen adversary. The story is partially told via flashbacks and takes place during three time periods.\nA sequel to the book, titled Malorie, was released on July 21, 2020. Bird Box was adapted into a film in 2018.\n\nPlot\nThe novel is narrated in the first person by the protagonist, Malorie, and takes place in the present day with alternating flashback sequences.\nInternational news sources report a series of cases involving people suddenly flying into homicidal and suicidal madness. After becoming pregnant following a one-night stand, Malorie realizes that the phenomenon has reached the United States. The madness seems to be generated by \"something\", believed to be an entity, which causes people to develop sudden and violent suicidal tendencies just by looking at it. Not being able to determine exactly what the threat is, the population runs for cover by hiding in their homes and covering the windows.\nFollowing the death of her sister Shannon, who committed suicide after accidentally looking out the window, Malorie follows a newspaper advertisement to a safe house with other survivors: Tom, Jules and his dog Victor, Felix, Don, Cheryl and Olympia, who, like Malorie, is about four months pregnant. The group barricades themselves in the house, only going out blindfolded to get water or dispose of garbage. Tom explains that the original owner of the safe house, George, had a theory that the entity could be seen indirectly without repercussions: to test the hypothesis, he recorded footage from a window and then watched it again after being tied to a chair by his companions. This tactic failed and George killed himself afterward.\nTom suggests using dogs to navigate when traveling outside the house, believing they may be immune to the creature. He and Jules search nearby houses for supplies and dogs to train, as Jules does not want to put Victor at risk. They find some birds in a box and decide to use them as an alarm, as they become agitated every time the creature approaches. On their way home, they encounter a tent bizarrely in the middle of the street in front of their house.\nAfter months of isolation, a man named Gary asks for asylum. He claims to have left his previous refuge because Frank, a recluse obsessed with writing in journals, believed the threat was merely caused by mass hysteria, going so far as to uncover the windows and open the doors to prove it. Gary befriends Don, frequently discussing Frank's ideology. Suspicious, Malorie secretly opens Gary's briefcase and finds \"Frank's\" journal. She reveals this to the housemates, leading to a majority vote in favor of Gary's eviction. Don becomes increasingly withdrawn and moves to the cellar.\nOver the next few months, the survivors use a phone book to call various numbers and leave messages on various answering machines, but they receive no response. Olympia and Malorie go into labor and are taken to the attic to give birth. Don is revealed to have been secretly sheltering Gary in the cellar; the latter confronts Malorie and reveals that he and Frank are the same person. Having already been mad prior to the cataclysm, he has no problem seeing the entity and has spied on the house's inhabitants long before seeking refuge. Downstairs, Don removes the window coverings, causing the other housemates to go mad and kill each other. Gary opens the attic door to allow the entity to enter; Malorie providentially covers her gaze, but Olympia sees it and goes mad. Before committing suicide, Olympia gives Malorie her newborn child.\nMalorie waits for Gary and the creature to leave and finds the corpses of the other housemates, but finds Victor alive in the locked cellar. Malorie answers a phone call from a survivor named Rick, who received the housemates' message and invites her to a safe haven, leaving her with detailed instructions. Malorie, burdened by grief over her companions' deaths and by the necessity of caring for two newborn children, declines his offer, but Rick reassures her that he will call her weekly and will always welcome her.\nMalorie raises the children using harsh training techniques in order to ensure their survival, heightening their senses and teaching them to automatically keep their eyes closed. The children are only referred to as \"Girl\" and \"Boy\", as she feels that names are an unnecessary luxury. During an exploration for supplies, Malorie discovers that animals are not immune to the entity, as Victor goes berserk.\nWhen the children are four years old, Malorie decides to journey to Rick's haven. She chooses a particularly foggy day in the hope of hiding their escape in case Gary is still spying on them. The three travel along a river, at one point ignoring a madman who tries to convince them to remove their blindfolds and behold the creature. They are later beset by a pack of wolves, one of which injures Malorie. The entity appears and nearly removes Malorie's blindfold, but then leaves the group. Malorie, needing to determine the right path, musters the courage to briefly remove her blindfold. Eventually they make it to the refuge, which she discovers was originally a school for the blind. They are met by the blind Rick, a sighted Constance, and dozens of other people who have blinded themselves to remain unaffected. Now certain in their safety, Malorie finally allows herself to name the children \"Tom\" and \"Olympia\" and tells them to remove their blindfolds.\n\nReception\nCritical reception for Bird Box has been positive and Malerman has received comparisons to Stephen King and Jonathan Carroll. Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club gave the book a B rating, writing \"Malerman overreaches a bit in his debut, which could use as much attention to the cast as to the mood, but the mood is chillingly effective. Reading it feels like accepting a dare to walk into a strange place, eyes closed, with no idea who, or what, might be reaching out to make contact.\"\nMalerman wrote the rough draft of Bird Box prior to the release of the 2008 M. Night Shyamalan film The Happening and the 2009 film The Road (although the novel The Road was written in 2006), which caused him to worry that the book \"might get lost in the shuffle.\"\n\nAwards and nominations\nMichigan Notable Book Award (2015, won)\nJames Herbert Award (2015, nominated)\nBram Stoker Award for Best First Novel (2015, nominated)\n\nFilm adaptation\n\nFilm rights to Bird Box were optioned by Universal Studios in 2013, prior to the book's release. Scott Stuber and Chris Morgan were initially set to produce the film, with Andy Muschietti (It, Mama) as director and Eric Heisserer in negotiations to pen the script. Netflix then acquired the rights of the book with Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich in starring roles, Morgan co-producing, Heisserer writing, and Susanne Bier as the director. A spin-off sequel, Bird Box Barcelona, was released on Netflix on July 14, 2023.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "The following is a list of cameo appearances by Stan Lee (1922–2018) in Marvel Comics films, television shows and video games. A prolific comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer, Lee has also had numerous cameos in non-Marvel media.\n\nMarvel appearances\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\nIn the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Stan Lee portrayed himself as an informant for the Watchers, keeping watch and detailing events that take place on Earth. Lee appeared in each installment of the franchise from Iron Man (2008) to Avengers: Endgame (2019), prior to his death. According to Joe Russo, Lee's cameos were filmed consecutively with cameos already filmed for releases in 2019.\n\nFilms\nIn Iron Man (2008), Lee, credited as \"Himself\", appears at a gala cavorting with three blondes, where Tony Stark mistakes him for Hugh Hefner. In the theatrical release of the film, Stark simply greets Lee as \"Hef\" and moves on; another version of the scene was filmed where Stark realizes his mistake, but Lee graciously responds, \"That's okay, I get this all the time.\" In 2008, Stan Lee named this as his favorite cameo appearance to that date.\nIn The Incredible Hulk (2008), Lee appears as a hapless citizen who accidentally ingests a soft drink contaminated with Bruce Banner's blood. He subsequently drops it and falls ill to gamma radiation sickness, leading to the discovery of Dr. Banner's location in a bottling plant in Brazil. A character in the film is also named after him, Stanley Lieber who owns Stanley's Pizza Parlor.\nIn Iron Man 2 (2010), during the Stark Expo, Lee, wearing suspenders and a red shirt and black and purple tie, is mistakenly greeted by Tony Stark as \"Larry King\".\nIn Thor (2011), Lee appears among many people at the site where Thor's hammer Mjolnir lands on Earth. He tears the bed off his pickup truck in an attempt to pull Mjolnir out of the ground with a chain and causes everyone in the scene to laugh by asking, \"Did it work?\". His character is credited as \"Stan the Man\", a nickname he had adopted during the Silver Age of Comic Books.\nIn Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Lee plays a general in World War II who mistakes another man for Steve Rogers / Captain America, commenting, \"I thought he'd be taller.\" Lee had nothing to do with the basic creation of the title character. However, Lee began his writing career in the character's original series where he created the idea of Captain America using his shield as a throwing weapon. Furthermore, he was responsible for reviving the character in the Silver Age of Comic Books and co-wrote most of the character's stories in The Avengers and his solo stories in that period.\nIn The Avengers (2012), Lee's character is interviewed about the Avengers saving Manhattan. Lee's character responds, \"Superheroes in New York? Give me a break\", and then returns to his game of chess. He also appears in a deleted scene in which, when a waitress flirts with Steve Rogers, Lee says to him, \"Ask for her number, you moron!\"\nIn Iron Man 3 (2013), Lee portrays a beauty pageant judge who appears on a television monitor and happily gives one of the contestants a 10.\nIn Thor: The Dark World (2013), Lee appears as a mental ward patient who loans his shoe to Erik Selvig for a demonstration about \"the Convergence\" in his delusions. When Selvig finishes and asks if anyone has questions, Lee says, \"Yeah, can I have my shoe back?\".\nIn Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Lee plays a security guard at the Smithsonian Institution who after discovering that Captain America stole his uniform from an exhibit, says, \"Oh man, I am so fired\".\nIn Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Lee appears as an elderly gentleman having a conversation with a significantly younger woman. Rocket, viewing him through a scanning device, dismisses him as part of what he saw was wrong with the planet Xandar. His catchphrase, Excelsior appears in Kree on the device. With the exception of the characters Groot, Ronan the Accuser and the Collector, Lee did not have a hand in the creation of the comics Guardians of the Galaxy.\nIn Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Lee appears as a World War II veteran who attends the Avengers' victory party. He claims he fought at Omaha Beach and that it proves he can handle a shot of Asgardian liquor from Thor, but is then carried away drunk, muttering his catchphrase, \"Excelsior\". Lee noted at the time that this was his favorite cameo before X-Men: Apocalypse.\nIn Ant-Man (2015), Lee appears as a bartender in a story Luis tells to Scott Lang explaining that Sam Wilson was looking for him. His part in the story is encouraging Luis's cousin, and the informer of the story, Ignacio, to talk to a \"crazy stupid fine\" woman at a table separate from the bar.\nIn Captain America: Civil War (2016), Lee appears as a FedEx postman, delivering a package from Steve Rogers to Tony Stark at the end of the film, mispronouncing the latter's name as \"Tony Stank\".\nIn Doctor Strange (2016), Lee appears as a bus rider reading Aldous Huxley's The Doors of Perception, oblivious to a battle between Doctor Strange, Mordo, and Kaecilius.\nIn Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Lee appears as an astronaut telling a story to the Watchers, mentioning his stint as a deliveryman in Civil War. He appears again in the post credits scenes, where the Watchers leave, tired of his stories as he quotes to them that they are his only ride back to Earth. In concept art, Lee is shown standing in a white outfit instead of the yellow he wears in the film. The Watchers, along with Ego, were co-created by Lee. Lee also makes an appearance in the music video for the song \"Guardians' Inferno\".\nIn Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Lee appears as an annoyed neighbor named Gary who, after witnessing Spider-Man mistakenly accosting an innocent civilian says to him, \"Don't make me come down there, you punk!\" His other neighbor, Marjorie, greets him, asking about his welfare, while he does the same to her, asking about her mother.\nIn Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Lee appears as a servant to the Grandmaster on Sakaar who cuts Thor's hair.\nIn Black Panther (2018), Lee appears as a patron of a casino in Busan, South Korea, and takes T'Challa's won, but unclaimed casino tokens.\nIn Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Lee appears as the driver of Peter Parker's school bus. When the students on the bus watch Ebony Maw's ship arriving, the driver says, \"What's the matter with you kids? You never seen a spaceship before?\".\nIn Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), Lee appears as a pedestrian whose car is shrunk by the Wasp. He remarks, \"Well the '60s were fun, but now I'm paying for it\".\nIn Captain Marvel (2019), Lee makes a posthumous appearance as himself, riding on a subway train and reading his lines from the screenplay for the film Mallrats. When he sees Carol Danvers, he smiles at her, and she smiles back. Although Lee did not create Danvers, the film's Captain Marvel, he co-created the first incarnation of the character in Marvel Comics. The Marvel Studios logo at the beginning of the film also pays tribute to Lee, with his MCU cameo appearances being incorporated into the logo and ending with the message \"Thank You Stan\".\nIn Avengers: Endgame (2019), Lee makes a posthumous appearance, digitally de-aged as a car driver in 1970, driving past army base Camp Lehigh and shouting, \"Hey man, make love, not war!\" The scene also features Lee alongside a digital re-creation of his wife, Joan Boocock Lee, as she appeared in the year 1970. His dog, Charlotte Lee is also referenced in name under Scott Lang's name on the Wall of the Vanished that Scott Lang sees. This was the final MCU and Marvel film overall to feature a Stan Lee cameo.\nIn Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), while Lee doesn't appear in the film, the film's screenplay indicates that a Lee look-a-like was intended to make a cameo appearance at the end of the film when Peter Parker unsuccessfully attempts to reconnect with Michelle \"MJ\" Jones and Ned Leeds. In an Easter egg by the film's VFX team, Lee's birthday is used as the number plate of a taxi cab in the film's bridge fight scene.\nIn Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023), James Gunn originally intended the character Lambshank to be voiced by and modeled after Lee. Following Lee's death, Lambshank was played by Gunn.\nIn Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), Lee makes a posthumous appearance on an ad for Stanlee Steamer, parody of Stanley Steemer.

        "content": "Barley stripe rust is a fungal disease of barley caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei. a forma specialis of Puccinia striiformis.  It was first detected in the United States in 1991, in northern and eastern Idaho in 1993, In 1995 it was detected for the first time in western Washington and western Oregon and is currently considered to be well established there. The disease initially develops at a small loci within a field and spreads rapidly and has caused significant losses in areas where climatic conditions are cool and wet.\n\nSymptoms\nInfections produce linear, orange-yellow pustules appear on leaves and/or heads.  As the disease progresses, pustules coalesce to form long stripes between leaf veins.  On susceptible cultivars, entire leaf blades may be covered with pustules. The black spore stage develops as linear black pustules covered by the leaf epidermis.\n\nDisease cycle\nPuccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei, is an obligate parasite that overseasons on volunteer barley or rye, certain wild barleys such as Hordeum jubatum (foxtail barley), wheat, and numerous perennial grass species.\nThe disease begins from a very small number of infections that are difficult or impossible to detect in the field. Spread of the pathogen can be explosive and cause significant losses, especially in the Pacific Northwest where cool, wet weather greatly favors disease development.\n\nManagement\nThe disease can be managed by growing disease resistant cultivars.  Foliar fungicides may be required when growing a susceptible cultivars.\n\nExternal links\nChen, X.M.; R.F. Line; H.

        "content": "Western Washington University (WWU or Western) is a public university in Bellingham, Washington, United States. The northernmost university in the contiguous United States, WWU was founded in 1893 as the state-funded New Whatcom Normal School, succeeding a private school of teaching for women founded in 1886. The university adopted its present name in 1977.\nWWU offers bachelor's and master's degrees as a few doctorates. In 2022, there were 14,747 students, 13,801 of whom were undergraduate students, and 664 full-time faculty. Its athletic teams are known as the Vikings, which compete in Division II of the National Collegiate Athletic Association.\nThe main campus is located on 215 acres in Bellingham. WWU also operates a marine center in Anacortes and academic locations in Everett and the Olympic and Kitsap Peninsulas. The university is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities.\n\nHistory\nWestern was established as the Northwest Normal School, a teachers' school predominantly for women although men also enrolled, by Phoebe Judson in Lynden, Washington, in 1886. Eventually the school moved to Bellingham (then \"New Whatcom\"), and through the efforts of William R. Moultray and George Judson (Phoebe's son). Governor John McGraw signed legislation establishing the New Whatcom Normal School on February 24, 1893. In November 1895, construction began on a permanent school building, now known as Old Main, the current administration building. Designed by prominent Seattle architects Warren Skillings & James Corner, it was completed by early 1897 but could not be opened to students until funds could be secured to install heating, lighting, and to do general grounds maintenance, which were not included in the original contract. The first official class entered in 1899, composed of 88 students.\nThe institution that is now Western Washington University underwent several name changes. In 1901, the school's name was changed to State Normal School at Whatcom to reflect New Whatcom's name change. In 1904, the name was changed to Washington State Normal School at Bellingham when the townships of Whatcom and Fairhaven joined, and again in 1937, to Western Washington College of Education when it became a four-year college. Twenty-four years later it became Western Washington State College and finally, in 1977, the institution gained university status and changed to its present name.\nThe 1960s was a period of especially rapid growth for Western, as its enrollment increased from 3,000 students to over 10,000 during the decade. Also during this time, the Fairhaven College of Interdisciplinary Studies was founded (1967), with non-traditional education methods that would serve as a model for Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington. Two years later, the College of the Environment, the nation's first dedicated environmental science college, was founded, continuing Western's trend toward \"cluster\" colleges. That same year, on a spring afternoon, students gained headlines by blocking Interstate 5 to protest the Vietnam War. Also in 1969, the College of Ethnic Studies was established; however, after being met with significant resistance, it was dismantled in 1975.\nSince this period, the College of Arts and Sciences was founded (1973) and divided into the College of Humanities & Social Sciences and the College of Science & Engineering (2003); the College of Fine and Performing Arts was formed from several art departments (1975); and the College of Business and Economics was established (1976).\nToday, WWU has a student body that currently consists of over 16,000 students. The university is the third largest in Washington after Washington State University and the University of Washington.\n\nMain campus\nWWU's main campus is located in Bellingham, a city of about 95,000 people, overlooking Bellingham Bay and many of the San Juan Islands. The university is 90 miles (140 km) north of Seattle, 55 miles (89 km) south of Vancouver, British Columbia, and an hour's drive from 10,778-foot (3,285 m) Mount Baker. The university is located close to Interstate 5.\n\nThe Bellingham campus is 215 acres (87 ha), including the 38-acre (15 ha) Sehome Hill Arboretum, operated jointly with the City of Bellingham. Campus facilities include an electronic music studio, an air pollution lab, a motor vehicle research lab, a marine research lab, a wind tunnel, and two electron microscopes. Western's Vehicle Research Institute has led Automobile Magazine to describe Western as \"very possibly the best school in the country for total car design.\" \nWestern also has off-campus facilities at Shannon Point Marine Center in Anacortes, Washington; Lakewood, a 15-acre (6.1 ha) student-university facility at nearby Lake Whatcom; and Whatcom County property used for environmental and aquatic analyses.\n\nPublic sculpture collection\nWWU's prized collection of outdoor and indoor public art sculptures is a major presence on its campus. The collection, funded by the Washington State Arts Commission, the National Endowment for the Arts, and private donations, includes 36 works: Founded in 1960, the collection includes large-scale works by James FitzGerald, Isamu Noguchi, Robert Morris, Mark di Suvero, Anthony Caro, Nancy Holt, Beverly Pepper, Richard Serra, Donald Judd and Bruce Nauman, among others.\n\nAcademics\nAcademic organization\nWestern offers multiple bachelor's degrees, as well as the degrees of Master of Arts, Master of Science, Master of Education, Master in Teaching, Master of Business Administration, Master of Professional Accounting, Master of Fine Arts, Master of Music, Clinical Doctorate in Audiology, and Doctor of Education. The university is also authorized to award honorary degrees. The university is composed of the following colleges:\n\nAccreditation\nThe university is accredited by the following:\n\nNorthwest Commission on Colleges and Universities\nNational Association of Schools of Music\nNational Recreation and Park Association\nAmerican Speech and Hearing Association\nNational Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education\nComputing Sciences Accreditation Board\nAccreditation Board for Engineering and Technology\nAmerican Chemical Society\nAssociation to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business\nCouncil for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs\nPlanning Accreditation Board\n\nHonors\nThe undergraduate honors program offers merit scholarships worth up to $5,000. These scholarships are awarded to successful applicants to the honors program. No separate application is necessary. High-achieving freshmen from colleges in other western states can enroll at Western at a reduced tuition level that is equivalent to a $30,000 four-year scholarship.\n\nRankings\nIn 2022-23, U.S. News ranked Western as the top public master's granting university in the Pacific Northwest, while placing 14th overall in the West (both public and private). Western was one of only two public schools ranked among the top 25 Master's-Granting Universities (West) category. The universities found in this ranking are schools that lack doctoral programs but still retain master's programs. The institution has a 93% acceptance rate.\nWestern Washington University ranked first among the top medium-sized colleges and universities with alumni serving as Peace Corps volunteers in 2013 and 2014.\n\nNotable degree programs\nThe Philosophical Gourmet Report mentions Western as having one of the nation's best philosophy departments among colleges and universities that offer only a B.A. in the discipline. Western was among only seven public universities so honored.\nThe Center for Canadian American Studies at Western Washington University is one of only two U.S. Department of Education–designated National Resource Centers for the study of Canada in the United States.\n\nAthletics\nWWU is an official member of NCAA Division II, having joined in September 1998. In 2011–12, approximately 350 students are participating in 15 varsity sports at Western, six for men and nine for women. In 2010–11, WWU placed seventh among 310 NCAA Division II schools in the Sports Director's Cup national all-sports standings, the second-highest finish in school history. The Vikings were sixth in 2009–2010 and tenth in 2008–2009. WWU has had eight straight Top 50 finishes and been among the Top 100 in each of its first 13 seasons as an NCAA II member.\nIn 2010–11, Western won its third straight and seventh overall Great Northwest Athletic Conference All-Sports championship, taking league titles in volleyball, men's golf and women's golf, and the regular-season crown in women's basketball. The Vikings, who won the Northwest Collegiate Rowing Conference championship, placed second in men's and women's cross country, men's and women's outdoor track, men's indoor track and softball.\nThe Vikings have won an NAIA national championship in softball (1998) and NCAA Division II national championships in women's rowing (2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2017), men's basketball (2012) and women's soccer (2016). WWU athletes have also won individual national championships in track and field.\n\nVarsity sports\nThe Vikings field varsity teams for men and women in cross country, soccer, golf, basketball, and track & field.  Women's teams compete in volleyball, softball, and rowing. Between 1903 and 2008 WWU fielded a football team but folded it in hopes of saving money to keep other WWU teams competitive.\n\nClub sports\nIn addition to its varsity sports programs, WWU also has a number of student-run club sports teams:\n\nBaseball\nRowing (Men's)\nClimbing\nCycling\nEquestrian\nFencing\nFigure Skating\nGolf\nHockey\nJudo\nLacrosse (Men's and Women's)\nRugby (Men's and Women's)\nSailing\nSwimming\nTennis\nUltimate (Men's and Women's)\nVolleyball (Men's and Women's)\nWakeboarding\nWater Polo (Men's and Women's)\nWater Skiing\nWrestling\n\nStudents\nA total of 16,121 students were in attendance at Western Washington University in the 2018–19 academic year. 92 percent of students are under 25 years of age, and 84 percent are from Washington State.\nMany students at Western Washington University participate in organized student government. The Associated Students of Western Washington University (ASWWU) is \"an organization designed and run by Western students, the Associated Students (AS) seeks to ensure a fulfilling college and academic experience for all university students through the many services, facilities and programs it offers.\" Within ASWWU, there are five main areas of focus: clubs, activities, programs, facilities & services, and governance.\nThe AS aims to provide \"funding, space and services\" to students \"uniting around common interests.\" The AS staff assist student development of clubs and provide advising, \"continuity, referral and record keeping\" throughout the entire process. Currently there are over two hundred student clubs in the following categories: Arts and Music, Cultural, Political, Special Interest, Gaming, Social Issues, Departmental, Limited Membership, Service, Religious, and Recreational.\nIn the 2021–22 school year, the music department has a new course for music education majors called K-12 Classroom Accompanying Pedagogy (MUS 262.) A new course in Music and Sustainability (MUS 397E) is available to all Western students.\nThe History Department offers HIST 390 which is a special topics class with in-depth readings of primary and secondary sources. In Spring of 2023, a HIST 390 on Indigenous History of North America was offered. The class covers the formation of the Iroquois confederacy, Mississippian chiefdoms, the Illinois people, Caddo people, and more. \nStudents who desire to set up a table in Red Square to promote their club need to sign up for a space through the university. A blue board at the West side of Red Square has general university policy on freedom of speech and also guidelines for using chalk on the bricks.\n\nMedia\nThere are multiple news outlets associated with the university.\n\nOfficial publications\nWWU's Office of University Communications operates several publications, including:\n\nWWU News, Western Washington University's main news site.\nWestern Today, a campus newsletter that's published several times a week.\nWindow, a twice-annual publication that's distributed to WWU alumni, donors, faculty and staff.\nThere is a livestream of Red Square filmed from the top of Bond Hall.\n\nStudent publications\nStudent-run publications at WWU include:\n\nThe Front (formerly The Western Front) is Western's official student newspaper covering city-wide and greater county-wide news. It operates independently of the university itself, though articles are written, edited, and published by students of the university. The Front was awarded as the \"Best All-Around Non-Daily Student Newspaper\" by the Society of Professional Journalists' Region 10 in 2017. The newspaper's first edition as the Western Front was published on October 10, 1967.\nKlipsun Magazine is a quarterly student magazine. Each issue of the magazine has a specific theme, and the periodical as a whole is intended to be an example of multimedia journalism.\nOccam's Razor, as well as Jeopardy, are formatted as academic journals, and aim to publish academic research done by Western undergraduates.\nThe Planet is published as part of the university's environmental studies program. The magazine promotes environmental awareness.\nWindow: The Magazine of Western Washington University (often referred to as Window Magazine), a magazine published two to three times a year by the university. It won multiple silver and bronze Council for Advancement and Support of Education Circle of Excellence awards in 2019.\nThe Student Publications Office of the university publishes the Front, Klipsun, Occam's Razor, and the Planet, as well as Jeopardy. The Associated Students of Western Washington University also operates media services, including Wavelength, a weekly online and printed alternative news source.\nThe KUGS radio station accepts albums from students to air. KUGS also has a large library of vinyl records that can be listened to in the studio.\n\nPolice\nThe Western Washington University Police Department (abbreviated WWUPD) are a university police force at the university. The police chief of the department is Katryne \"Katy\" Potts, who was sworn into the position in January 2023. The department also has a staff of \"Green Coats\" under their public safety branch, who offer \"safety escorts on campus, event security staffing and building access services for current students.\"\n\nPeople\nNotable faculty\nJames Bertolino, English\nJeff Carroll, Psychology\nCatherine T.

        "content": "== Critically Damped ==\nCan someone explain to me how a critically damped system would converge faster when in fact it is multiplied by t in part of the solution? Since the over-damped system is a decaying exponential times a constant it would decay faster than the exponential time a positivally growing constant.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 72.84.196.167 (talk) 01:40, 29 October 2008 (UTC)\n\nUnderdamped\nSo an underdamped door-closer will \"bounce\" on the way to being closed?  Should mention this to complete the analogy. jyavner 21:31, 26 November 2005 (UTC)\nI think the door-closer analogy is a bit confusing.  A door-closer's motion is only described by a second-order differential equation if there is a spring involved, as well as the mass and damper.  If it's just a mass and damper, then it can be described by a first-order differential equation and it cannot be described as over-, critically-, or under-damped.  Perhaps a spring should be mentioned in these analogies?  Dkraemer1 19:43, 11 January 2007 (UTC)\n\nConsider a door with no spring force. Open it, release it from rest... and watch as nothing happens. This is just a regular door. (CHF (talk) 23:46, 14 June 2009 (UTC))\n\nGif: Underdamped\nI think it's probably a good idea to alter the current gif-file a bit, in a way that the system stays in 'rest' a little bit longer'. Just add a frame or 2, 3 with the end of the simulation I purpose. Right now, the thing doesn't seem to stop at the end of the simulation. \nAnyone able to alter this? --Flekkie (talk) 21:16, 25 May 2012 (UTC)\n\nOver damped\nIs it worth including that over-damping is 'aperiodic' motion? Given the necessary initial conditions the motion can pass through the equilibrium position once (but only once), i.e. start off with a positive displacement, pass through zero, then converge to zero from the negative side. It doesn't always look like exponential decay as in the diagram. (source: 'Vibrations and Waves in Physics', Third Edition, Iain G. Main)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 87.102.123.249 (talk) 11:56, 23 January 2010 (UTC)\n\nImage change\nI've replaced Image:Springdampermass.png with Image:Mass-Spring-Damper.png, which I originally drew for Nondimensionalization.  I also changed the symbol used for the damping constant in the article from R to B to match the image.  Of course, it would be easy to create a variant of the image with a different symbol and without the external force arrow, but I feel it looks good enough as it is.  If you disagree, please say so (or just revert me, it's no big deal).  —Ilmari Karonen (talk) 23:03, 24 January 2006 (UTC)\nMove from my talk--Light current 21:22, 27 May 2006 (UTC)\nI think that the figure looks great, but it is a little bit confusing on one point: x should be defined as positive in one direction.  Showing x going both ways makes it difficult to figure out the direction of the spring and damping forces.  Dkraemer1 19:46, 11 January 2007 (UTC)\n\nNotation changes at Damping\nI notice you (and 72.132.7.159, which I assume is your IP address) have been editing Damping to change the notation used in the article, in particular changing the sigmas used to denote the damping factor to zetas (or, in earlier edits, to alphas).  While I appreciate your attempts to improve the article, plase note the following:\n\nThe article currently has consistent notation.  Please keep it that way.  If you change, for example, some of the sigmas to zetas without changing them all, the article becomes very confusing and potentially misleading.  When making notation changes like this, please either a) use the preview button to check your edits, and only save after you've checked that you've changed all the symbols consistently, or b) copy and paste (the relevant sections of) the article to the talk page or to a user subpage for drafting, make the changes there, and then copy the result back.\nThe symbol zeta (ζ), in particular, is already used in the article to denote the damping ratio (σ/ω0).  If you wish to use it for the damping factor, you need to choose some other symbol for the ratio.\nIn general, it's better to discuss changes like this on the talk page first before making them.  That way, we can choose a consistent notation that all editors find appropriate and avoid needless back-and-forth edit warring.

The symbol for damping factor is zeta. Someone else has been changing the symbols. I intend to revert the page and change the so called 'damping ratio' symbol to sigma as it should be.--Light current 21:17, 27 May 2006 (UTC)\nActually, it seems you introduced the use of σ (it used to be α) for the damping factor yourself.  The note about ζ being used for the damping ratio was added earlier by 212.225.34.56.

I think we need to revert to a much earlier version around 18 May and go from there. What do you think?--Light current 01:50, 28 May 2006 (UTC)\n\nI've been reverting any changes that left the notation in an inconsistent state — I don't personally care whether the symbol for the damping factor is σ or ζ, as long as it's consistently one or the other.  The article is right now essentially same as it was on 18 May; the changes since then are mostly cosmetic (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ω\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\omega _{0}}\n  \n to ω0 etc.).

One thing that is bothering me tho' is the introduction of the 'damping ratio' early on and its inclusion in the system description. THis tends to confuse the issue. The equation is usually quoted using the damping factor only. I intend to change this soon. THanks for your help. 8-)--Light current 14:01, 28 May 2006 (UTC)\n\nI see the conflict. There seem to be conflicting definitions of \"damping ratio\", not just different symbols. For the most part, this article seems to differentiate the two properly by calling one the damping \"factor\" and the other the damping \"ratio\". Modern control theory states that the damping ratio is used to determine whether the system is over, under, or critically damped.

I will denote the damping ratio as it is currently defined in the article, though I personally use them the opposite way.\nDefinition 1: \n  \n    \n      \n        ζ\n        =\n        \n          \n            B\n            \n              2\n              m\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\zeta ={B \\over 2m}}\n  \n\nThis definition really doesn't give much meaning to the term, requiring it be compared to the natural frequency.\nDefinition 2: \n  \n    \n      \n        σ\n        =\n        \n          \n            B\n            \n              2\n              m\n              ×\n              \n                ω\n                \n                  0\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma ={B \\over 2m\\times \\omega _{0}}}\n  \n\nRather than comparing it to your natural frequency, your system is always critically damped when \n  \n    \n      \n        σ\n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma =1}\n  \n.

However, the name for this parameter is given as the \"damping factor\".  This is not the standard in engineering literature, from what I've seen.  It should be called the \"damping ratio\".  A quick look at the Wikipedia entries for damping ratio and damping factor confirms this conclusion.  Dkraemer1 20:34, 11 January 2007 (UTC)\nI want to propose a constant change for the damping coefficient from capital B to a lower case c.  This change would put the article in line with the standard notation taken in most engineering programs.

It shows the critical damping case with the greatest initial negative gradient, whereas in fact it should be the under-damped case. The less damping, the faster the system initially heads toward the point of stability: the problem of course is that if insufficiently damped it overshoots.

It has multiple meanings. — Omegatron 00:53, 28 June 2006 (UTC)\nSo did I. In over 30 years in electronics, I have never heard the term dampening used, nor have I seen it in any of the hundreds of books I must have read over that time. If you can find a reliable respected reference source using the term 'dampening' to describe what we are tring to, then I will accept it for inclusion 8-)--Light current 07:11, 28 June 2006 (UTC)\nBoth terms are gerunds. Their roots, Dampen and Damp, have several transitive and intransitive definitions. Among the \"control/limit\" definitions, dampen and damp can seem very similar by denotation. The gerunds, however, are not usually used in the same connotation. Only damping can relate to control theory or oscillations. In other words, if you damp a second order system to keep it within stable parameters, you are dealing with its damping, which is now a term describing a field of study. Dampening is not used in its gerund form as often and more often relates to suppressing abstract concepts, like dampening a political movement. Webster uses \"The heat dampened our spirits\" as an example.\nYou might look at the words' origins to confirm this, but you might suggest that all physical properties are damped and abstract properties are dampened.  However, I'm more inclined to believe that damping requires indirectly affecting oscillations, etc. by controlling some damping factor that it depends on. Therefore dampen is used for taking direct actions to \"silence\" the direct object where there is no differential equation to describe the situation. This could justify musicians' use of dampening when they just use their hands to dampen the sound. Supporting the physical/abstract theory, for example, you might damp a fire, or use \"inertial dampers\" in Star Trek, but dampen a mood. The latter theory might be supported by the same examples saying that you are limiting the oxygen factor that fire needs or increasing the stiffness parameter in a spring, while there is no differential equation and thus no damping ratio to describe direct intervention.\nMy conclusion is: damping is a mathematical concept describing a means of affecting some natural response with a constant damping factor, and dampening is a direct intervension of the scope of some concept with no defined consistant damping factor.--Mysteryegg 20:11, 23 July 2006 (UTC)\n\nOh it's also interesting to note that a \"damper\" can relate to either term.\n\nThe importance of gamma\nCan anyone say why this parameter has been introduced? It just seems to complicate the picture! I mean what does it represent anyway? 8-(--Light current 21:12, 27 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nIt's the exponent you solve for.  In any case, it's useful to let the reader know that the whole system can be characterized by a single complex parameter, at least to anyone who is familiar with exponentials in the complex plane.  Knowing that the solution is of the form \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          e\n          \n            γ\n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle e^{\\gamma t}}\n  \n immediately tells me that, depending on the parameter, the solution will look like exponential decay possibly combined with oscillation.\nI'm not quite sure if your explanation helps... I'm not even sure the information on the page about gamma is correct; it is confusing to say the least. I have information from a textbook source that says the amplitude at time t is \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        =\n        \n          e\n          \n            −\n            γ\n            t\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A(t)=e^{-\\gamma t/2}}\n  \n, so I'm not sure what x represents, but apparently not x(t). It may be something pertinent, but I believe the equation for A(t) should at least be included in the page, possibly replacing x. I thought x is the displacement, but the exponential equation doesn't make sense for that, besides, it's already given by \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        c\n        o\n        s\n        (\n        \n          ω\n        \n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Acos({\\omega }t)}\n  \n.

It is also worth noting that a critically damped closer might suffer a bounce as well, if the person gave the door a sufficiently large initial shove (i.e., a sufficiently large initial velocity in the \"closing\" direction).  Critical damping does not imply that there is no crossing through the equilibrium state; whether the static equilibrium position is passed or not depends on the initial conditions.  Furthermore, though I do not design these devices, I strongly suspect that that they are designed to be (highly) overdamped rather than critically damped for precisely this reason - a sufficiently large amount of damping makes it impossible for a person to slam the door.  All closers in my experience appear to exhibit this behavior.  (I am not including those two-way swinging doors between restaurant dining rooms and kitchens, which are clearly underdamped, and have little or no intentionally included damping.)\nIn response to Dkraemer1, who brought up the subject of springs and the order of the ODE involved, the door closer itself must contain a spring element.  If there were no spring, the door would never move on its own, and it would never \"seek\" the closed position.  The closer+door system is indeed, therefore, a second-order mass-spring-damper system.  It may also be worth noting that the spring is not at its equilibrium position when the door is closed; rather, it is somewhat deflected, so that the door is held in its closed position with some (nonzero) force.\nThe most important thing that needs to be said (and currently isn't) regarding the critical damping case is that it gives the fastest possible return to a state of equilibrium.\nFor all of these reasons, I propose removing all mention of door closers in connection with critical damping and inserting language making clear that critical damping produces a system with the fastest possible return to a state of equilibrium.\nTpower27 21:08, 6 June 2007 (UTC)\n\nMerger proposal\nI made a full revision to this article, added some more formulation and a picture comparing the different system behaviors.\nI feel that there is no need for a separate article for Damping ratio, as there are duplicate explanations and the understanding of the damping ratio should be favored by including it in the [[Damping] article. So, I propose to merge Damping ratio to Damping. - Nmnogueira 11:35, 21 September 2007 (UTC)\n\nSupport - For the reasons stated above - Nmnogueira 11:35, 21 September 2007 (UTC)\nSupport - Same reasons. More useful for readers if merged (until damping article becomes bigger). Frédérick Lacasse (talk · contribs) 18:13, 3 November 2007 (UTC)\nSupport - I agree for the reason that wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and not a dictionary to have a separate entry for every term.  However, if it is decided to merge the 2, it should never be separated if the damping article becomes bigger per Frédérick.  There is plenty to be said about damping that is not listed in the article, but a standard needs to be set across the board in terms of how detailed and complete a science based entry should be.  i.e, the wiki non-science entry of \"President of the United States of America\" talks about the job responsibilities, origin, election, campaign, term duties etc.  it obvious lists some of the former presidents, but does not go into a ton of detail.  There are individual wiki entries for each president.  (this is obvious not possible), but lets say there was a wiki entry for \"President of the United States of America\" during George Washington's time...it would be reasonable to include the details of each president in the entry for \"President of the United States of America\", and not have an individual entry for each president.  It would be reasonable, as many years go by, to separate the wiki entry into multiple wiki entries: the position, and the men...Every 4 to eight years a new president is elected, but even past presidents still make news all the time, adding to their wiki entries.\nDamping, and most classic sciences are not expanding in the same manner.  It's true that there are not wiki entries for every scientific property, and not all have been adequately written in the wiki world.  However, the wiki appropriate info for the majority of sciences is well known, and can be found by scanning section headers in physics/engineering/science textbooks.  It is more acceptable for cutting edge technologies, such as nano-tech to be split into multiple entries...not damping however.  \nLastly, if you are going to merge \"damping constant\" into damping, you also need to merge \"Coulomb damping\", \"Shock absorber\", & \"Dashpot\" into damping.  If there is ever a \"viscous damping\" wiki created, that needs to go into damping as well. \nBut if you are going to merge these together, it should be done across the board...i.e, \"Torsional vibration\" needs to be merged into \"Vibration\", because they have virtually the same relations and equations...but instead of mass for linear, you have moment of inertia for torsional, and instead of x for linear, you have θ for torsional\nAs an engineering student, i would much rather look at one entry for \"damping,\" and see \"all\" there is to do with damping in one article.  of course each section would be titled, and if i searched for something specific, like \"damped natural frequency\", \"damping\" would still come up as a result if it is included in the damping article.

The relationship between ride quality (low damping ratio) vs. handling (high damping ratio) is relatively well studied.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 129.82.18.94 (talk) 20:08, 12 December 2007 (UTC) \nstrongly OPPOSE merger.....Practically the people search both the stuffs for different purposes.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 129.175.82.248 (talk) 08:46, 1 February 2008 (UTC)\n\nmerge Q factor with damping\nAs far as I can tell, the Q factor and the damping ratio are 2 ways to measure basically the same thing (see Q factor for the simple equation between them).\nI think they should be merged into the same article.\nSince it looks like \"damping ratio\" is going to be merged into this \"damping\" article (see above), I guess Q factor should (sooner or later) be merged in as well.\n--75.19.73.101 (talk) 10:02, 16 December 2007 (UTC)\n\nOppose - It might make sense to merge Q factor with damping ratio, since they are closely related; or to merge damping ratio with damping; but not both; or to make damping ratio a disambig page to go to either Q factor or damping.  This article on damping is more about the process and different regimes of damping, not about the general number that characterizes the behavior of certain physical systems and differential equations.  The article on damping and the article on Q factor have little in common, and should stay that way, in my opinion. Dicklyon (talk) 02:45, 17 December 2007 (UTC)\nOppose - No, they're not the same thing and are used for different purposes. 202.89.188.44 (talk)  —Preceding comment was added at 15:16, 25 January 2008 (UTC)\nOppose, weakly - Yes, they are two ways to measure the same thing, but there is preference for different in different fields.  Q originated in electronics and is used more in engineering, and for sharply resonant, underdamped systems; many of the Q formulas are approximations only valid for that regime.  Whereas it seems to me damping ratio is used more by physicists, mathematicians, and in control systems theory.  I guess they could be treated in the same article, but what would we call it?  I guess I favor merging Damping and Damping ratio and leaving Q_factor separate, but mentioning both numbers in both articles and providing conversion formulas. --ChetvornoTALK 00:18, 26 January 2008 (UTC)\nStrongly Oppose - Different fields, different applications.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 220.233.17.28 (talk) 12:26, 26 May 2008 (UTC)\n\nMerged Musical Damping\nThe \"Dampening\" article was exclusively describing musical damping, even though it used the term \"dampening\".  It seems the more common usage is to call that damping too, dampening seeming to be a much less common way to refer to it, if Google hits on musical terms mean anything.  I could see this stuff belonging in a \"Damping (music)\" article possibly, but the concept is pretty much the same as it is in physics and control systems, and the other article was pretty short, so I just merged.  The material is not well integrated right now.  It occurs to me that you might use the musical concept to help explain the physics concept, killing two birds with one stone. Gigs (talk)  —Preceding comment was added at 04:54, 26 March 2008 (UTC) \n\nI think this article would be improved if the musical damping section were moved back to a separate page.  All the musical examples are basically cases where the musician wants to totally suppress the sound/vibration and therefore is not a particularly interesting example of the physical damping phenemona.  Similarly, if you are mainly interested in these musical techniques, examining the formula for harmonic oscillation is not going to be very interesting either and is likely to be confusing.  So while musical damping is related to the physical/mathematical damping described on this page, it really doesn't fit.  It is like having Poaching An Egg section in a Phase Changes of Matter page because both involve boiling.  71.234.28.244 (talk) 13:37, 23 July 2009 (UTC)\nI agree.  I think we should undo the merge, and put the musical stuff back at Dampening, or possibly move it to a better name like Damping (music).  As discussed above, these terms are not synonyms, at least in the context of the definition used in this article, which is the more technical meaning.  Dicklyon (talk) 15:50, 23 July 2009 (UTC)\n\nMistake in graph?\nThe graph [[1]] doesn't look right to me.  Surely the green line and the blue line should not cross as x decreases to zero.  And the 3 lines should all have the same gradient at t = 0, because the motion there (when the velocity is small) depends only on the mass and the spring constant, not the damping coefficient.  --Occultations (talk) 12:04, 18 March 2009 (UTC)\n\nYes, the figure comes with matlab code, and he plotted the wrong functions.  Maybe I'll work on it...  Dicklyon (talk) 15:57, 23 July 2009 (UTC)\nHere is a source with the correct equations.  Note that that curves start out cosine-like (zero velocity) and all have the same curvature (acceleration) at time 0.  Dicklyon (talk) 16:56, 23 July 2009 (UTC)\nOK, it's fixed.  Dicklyon (talk) 08:54, 2 August 2009 (UTC)\nThat's much better.  Could I suggest that the units along the the time axis be cycle times rather than seconds.  I would do it myself if I knew how. Occultations (talk) 17:50, 4 August 2009 (UTC)\nIt's actually units of time constants, or radians of natural frequency, or t*omega_0.  What would you like me to label it?  Perhaps the latter?  Dicklyon (talk) 00:06, 5 August 2009 (UTC)\nI see you've labelled it omega_0*t.  I had to think about that before I convinced myself it's correct.  And of course it's dimensionless.  So that's a lot better.Occultations (talk) 16:50, 7 August 2009 (UTC)\n\nMoving to Damped harmonic oscillator\nI would like to move this to Damped harmonic oscillator, since that is really what this page is about.  It might help avoid the merging problem with Q, for instance.  It also fits in as a 'subpage' of harmonic oscillator.  TStein (talk) 05:10, 9 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nOppose – I hadn't noticed this old unsupported move proposal before, but I like the current title better, just because it's simpler and a bit more general.  Dicklyon (talk) 22:23, 19 October 2009 (UTC)\n\nDamped simple pendulum with forced motion.\nI think there should be an example of a damped oscillator with forced motion. Namely the damped simple pendulum as it is the most easiest example ever. Also, I think that this will add a new dimension to the article as this aspect is not discussed.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by Gustav Ulsh Iler (talk • contribs) 22:20, 19 October 2009 (UTC) \n\nDefinitely a good idea; the classical diff eq. for a spring/mass/damper, leading to driven solutions, resonance plots, Q factor, etc., would be good to see done out well.  Does it exist in some other article already?  Here are some good sources to work from.

Dampening is proportional to the velocity the mass would be travelling at, and a spring does not produce damping. A dampener produces damping. A spring produces a force proportional to the distance it is stretched. Someone want to change this  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 82.19.28.168 (talk) 16:53, 23 March 2010 (UTC) \n\nThe diagram does not show a damping component. The motion of the block indicates that one is present. Air is a damper. It would be an improvement if a damper component was explicitly illustrated as we have in File:Mass-Spring-Damper.png. --Kvng (talk) 20:40, 22 November 2010 (UTC)\n\nDampener\nDampener should be Damper. Dampener is something that makes an object damp, i.e. wet. In academic literature we just call something that restraints movement a damper. I agree with the diagram could be made better with a visible damper element. Though a non-ideal spring would have some form of energy loss. That diagram can be considered an exagerated case of frictional damping --MobiusPizza (talk) 10:59, 26 July 2010 (UTC)\n\nWhy does \"Scratching (guitar)\" redirect to this article?\nThe word \"guitar\" does not even appear in this article, so (without reading it) I assume this is an incorrect redirect, and this article doesn't cover the guitar technique of scratching dampened (palm-muted) strings.

If you can fix this, please do!\n\n--Ben Culture (talk) 04:56, 13 September 2012 (UTC)\n\nOmega and Omega_0 undefined...\nThe part of the following sentence from the article which is in brackets seems interesting, yet is worthless to the reader because omega and omega_0 are undefined:\n\"In physics, damping is an effect that reduces the amplitude of oscillations in an oscillatory system (except for mass-dominated systems where \\omega/ \\omega_0 > √2), particularly the harmonic oscillator.\"\nIt is not enough to assume that readers will be familiar with maths-symbol norms when writing on scientific subjects.\nPerhaps someone who knows what these terms are could include \", where \\omega is ___________ and \\omega_0 is ___________\" after the √2?  Cheers.\n109.145.85.3 (talk) 17:34, 26 April 2013 (UTC)\n\nI think I have rarely come across a worse opening sentence. It is barely readable and that parenthesis is incomprehensible. WP:LEADSENTENCE says \"The first sentence should tell the nonspecialist reader what (or who) the subject is.\" This is part of WP:LEAD that says, \"The lead should define the topic and summarize the body of the article with appropriate weight.\" That phrase about omega and root-two relates to something that, as far as I can see, is never mentioned again in the body of the article, so has no place in the lead, let alone in a parenthesis that wrecks the opening sentence. If there is any point to that inequality, it should be explained deep in the article, and if it truly turns out to be one of the most important things that can be said about the whole topic of damping, it can be summarised somewhere in the lead. --Nigelj (talk) 19:42, 31 October 2013 (UTC)\nI have rewritten the opening paragraph, as below. Damping is a linear influence within or upon an oscillatory system that has the effect of reducing, restricting or preventing the oscillations. Viscous drag can do this in a mechanical system, and in electronic oscillators, resistance can have the same effect. A potentially oscillatory variable is damped when a damping influence opposes changes in it in direct proportion to the instantaneous rate of change, velocity or time derivative, of the variable itself.\nAny comments and further improvements welcome. --Nigelj (talk) 20:19, 31 October 2013 (UTC)\nI have a few ideas about improvement that I will try to implement soon. My motivation is as follows:\nDamping does not have to be linear.\nqualitative and less detailed things (like the typed of damping) should come first\narticle needs to be better linked to other articles.\nIf it is ok with all involved I would prefer to do this in the article space under the idea that it is holier to ask forgiveness than permission.\n-- TStein (talk) 16:24, 1 November 2013 (UTC)\nI have made some changes to the main article that addressed most of the issues that I raised. The beginning of the article is roughly where I would like to see it in the big picture at least. There are still a few duplicate paragraphs in the Linear Damping section that I would like to combine, but I have ran out of time for now. The example used is a little to mathematically heavy for my taste and may fit better with harmonic oscillator. It would also be nice to have a consistent notation. I am afraid that I don't have time to deal with them now, though ;( .\n\n-- TStein (talk) 20:32, 1 November 2013 (UTC)\n\nBuoyancy force\nWhy is the effect of buoyancy force not considered in case of fluids?

While the concept of damping may well apply to other types of systems, this article focuses solely on damped harmonic oscillators, and that topic is already completely covered elsewhere. Had I noticed this article at its creation, I would have nominated it for speedy deletion under WP:CSD#A10 but as it has existed for some length of time and been edited by several editors, I believe the best course now is to find any material in this article that is unique and not already covered at the other article and move it there, leaving this as a redirect. WikiDan61ChatMe!ReadMe!! 14:36, 3 November 2016 (UTC)\n\n Done Given that there is no objection, I have redirected to Harmonic oscillator.

In its simplest form, damping exists as a form of entropy generation, while the damping ratio is a convenient parameter used in the non-dimensional analysis of an oscillating system.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Antwan718 (talk • contribs) 02:27, 22 May 2018 (UTC) \n\nBut damping ratio is just a way to quantify the rate of entropy conversion; perhaps damping would be a more inclusive topic, but it doesn't sound like a separate topic. Dicklyon (talk) 02:46, 22 May 2018 (UTC)\nIn 2016, this version of Damping was merged into Harmonic oscillator, which makes sense given what the content was at that time.   Your version that I reverted is here, for reference.  It's not clear where it's headed, but let's see more of a proposal, e.g. a draft as a subpage of your user page: User:Antwan718/Damping.  Dicklyon (talk) 02:46, 22 May 2018 (UTC)\n@Antwan718: please see WP:SPLIT and tell us what your justification is for this proposal. ~Kvng (talk) 15:08, 26 May 2018 (UTC)\n\n@Dicklyon: :@Kvng:  Damping,  could  be  defined  as  the  process  by  which  a  certain  portion  of  the  energy  in  a   system  is  irreversibly  lost  causing  a  decaying magnitude trend in the measured response of the system [ http://db.nzsee.org.nz/2011/091.pdf ]. In practical applications damping may be observed in mechanical systems such as those observed in vehicle dynamics [2], electro-magnetic [3], optical [4], dynamic models of atomic behavior [ ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1183847/ ], and several other forms of systems. In each of the above listed cases, the energy which is not retained in the measured response is converted to heat, photon emission, or a coupled electro-magnetic field.\nEven in the fields which there is investigative analysis of damping, there is not a truly well understood manner which explicitly states how damping occurs; by having the wikipedia entry limited strictly to \"damping ratio\" it makes the incoproation of other quantification of damping such as the use of a Loss Factor prohibitive. There is a good review article that discusses the relation between damping, damping ratio, and the loss factor phenomena [5].\n\nDicklyon The largest issue which I see is that from the context of the existing damping ratio article, there is a strict application to only mechanical processes which function based from viscous damping. There are at least two other forms of mechanical damping models: hysteric damping, and Coulomb damping; which can not fit the model explained in damping ratio which is only applicable toviscous damping.\n@Dicklyon: The concepts of the harmonic oscillator and anharmonic oscillator are integrally related to damping though the separation of these two models is fundamentally paramount to modeling [molecular vibration].\nYes, I get your point.  The current damping ratio and harmonic oscillator models are about viscous, resistive, or linear damping, but there are nonlinear forms of damping such as frictional that lead to anharmonic systems and not covered here.  But what's less clear is what your plan is to fix this.  It's not clear that the split you propose is the right way.  If you present an article or two in the form of user draft(s) we could get a better idea.  Your skeletal draft that I reverted did not look promising; you'll need to do more to show that there's a good direction here.  There's no reason not to do it in your user space first.  When your ready, put a Template:Split tag on the page. Dicklyon (talk) 01:32, 29 May 2018 (UTC)\nWe used to have a separate article for Damping. Here's the last version of it before it was merged to Damping ratio. We merged it because there was so much overlap between the two articles. Is there a way to do a WP:SPLIT that avoids this overlap issue? Another option is to rename Damping ratio to Damping and still cover the metric and phenomenon in the same article. ~Kvng (talk) 13:05, 31 May 2018 (UTC)\nActually, as I pointed out above, that version of Damping was merged into Harmonic oscillator, since that's what it was mostly about.  I agree with your proposal to move Damping ratio to Damping and expand its scope a bit, with Damping ratio as a section, and then if it gets to be too much we can consider the proposed split. Dicklyon (talk) 14:24, 31 May 2018 (UTC)\nI have recovered material from Damping to broaden the scope of the lead. If this looks like a good direction to Antwan718 too, we can request the move. ~Kvng (talk) 17:08, 3 June 2018 (UTC)\n\nMade it a disambig page\nToo many incoming links to the redirect were for distinctly difference specific aspects of damping, so I made it a disambig page.  Now the incoming links need to be sorted for what was intended.  Could be harmonic oscillator or damping ratio or damping factor or some of those other forms of damping.  Alternatively, we could go back to the broad topic article as suggested above in 2018; but we'd still want to review incoming links and get some of them to better places.  Dicklyon (talk) 06:36, 22 February 2021 (UTC)\n\n@Dicklyon and Kvng: I very much agree with Kvng's suggestion to rename Damping ratio to Damping and still cover the metric and phenomenon in the same article. The Damping ratio article actually already does so at this point, so all that's left is to rename. In fact, I proposed this yesterday at Talk:Damping ratio#Damping vs Damping ratio as I'm only now finding out that this option has already been discussed. If you both still agree this is a good idea and/or have any other input, please let me know over there. Lennart97 (talk) 09:57, 3 March 2021 (UTC)"

        "content": "The Great Battles of Caesar is 1998 computer wargame developed by Erudite Software and published by Interactive Magic. Based on the board wargame The Great Battles of Julius Caesar, it is the third and final entry in the Great Battles computer wargame series.\n\nGameplay\nDevelopment\nThe Great Battles of Caesar was announced by publisher Interactive Magic and developer Erudite Software in early 1997, alongside its direct predecessor, Hannibal. Erudite had signed with the company in mid-1996 to publish both games' forebear, The Great Battles of Alexander, after that title's long and troubled development cycle. The publisher declared its intent to release all three games as the Great Battles series in January 1997, and assigned S. Craig Taylor to be their producer. GMT Games assisted in the creation of the series, and each entry was based on one of its board titles. Alexander launched in June, while Hannibal appeared on November 7. By mid-1997, Interactive Magic had scheduled Caesar for release in spring of the following year.\nErudite based Caesar on GMT's board wargame The Great Battles of Julius Caesar, but built it with a modified form of the mechanical game system it had previously used in Alexander and Hannibal. To simulate Roman tactics in the era following Hannibal's defeat (which scholars through much of the 20th century attributed to so-called \"Marian reforms\"), the team altered the series' mechanics to change the basic unit from the manipular legion, with its three lines (hastati, principes and triarii) of infantry, to the more homogeneous Marian legion. However, Erudite sought \"only slightly\" to represent the many tactical changes during this era, such as by mimicking the expansion of Rome's chain of command via the inclusion of section commanders. Caesar shares its predecessors' game engine, which the team updated for the project. Visual upgrades were included as well.\nIn early January 1998, Interactive Magic confirmed the spring release date for Caesar, and announced that it would cease publishing Great Battles titles thereafter. Computer Gaming World wargame columnist Terry Coleman lamented this decision, which he called \"a real shame for fans of [GMT Games'] Samurai in particular\". Later in January, the publisher gave Caesar a firmer release date of March. Erudite completed the game on March 11, and it launch on the 26th.\n\nReception\nThe Great Battles of Caesar was the runner-up for Computer Gaming World's 1998 \"Best Wargame\" award, which ultimately went to The Operational Art of War. The editors wrote of Caesar, \"With improved graphics, aggressive AI, a solid campaign, and an excellent scenario editor, it's the best ancients game in more than a decade for the PC.\"\nComputer Gaming World's Jim Cobb called Caesar \"not only the best of the Great Battles series to date, it's also the most realistic ancients-era game yet on the PC.\" While he found its graphics middling, and noted that the slow performance continued from its predecessors, Cobb summarized, \"If you're willing to put up with its eccentricities, Caesar does a remarkable job of recreating ancient warfare.\" Mark H. Walker of Computer Games Strategy Plus wrote that Caesar is \"fun, challenging, and mildly addictive\", but also \"annoyingly flawed and somewhat dated.\" Like Cobb, he criticized the game's slow performance, and called the campaign mode \"as strategically challenging as a game of Chutes and Ladders.\" Walker summarized Caesar as \"worth a look\".\n\nAftermath\nFollowing the release of Caesar, rumors spread inside the game industry that publisher Interactive Magic intended to reuse the Great Battles game engine for another project. In June, this new game was revealed under the tentative title Rally Round the Flag, under development again by Erudite. It was designed by Craig Taylor; Erudite created only the art and code for the project. Later renamed North vs. South, the game launched in February 1999.\nIn July 1998, Interactive Magic announced The Great Battles: Collector's Edition, which bundled Caesar with its two predecessors. This SKU updated Hannibal and Alexander to match Caesar's visuals and programming, and includes a mission editor that allows players to create hypothetical battles. Originally set for September 1998, the Collector's Edition was ultimately released in December.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "The dangers to journalists in Russia have been known since the early 1990s but concern over the number of unsolved killings soared after Anna Politkovskaya's murder in Moscow on 7 October 2006. While international monitors mentioned a dozen deaths, some sources within Russia talked of over two hundred fatalities.\nThe evidence has since been examined and documented in two reports, published in Russian and English, by international organizations. These revealed a basic confusion in terminology that explained the seemingly enormous numerical discrepancy: statistics of premature death among journalists (from work accidents, crossfire incidents, and purely criminal or domestic cases of manslaughter) were repeatedly equated with the much smaller number of targeted (contract) killings or work-related murders. It is worth considering that while not all murders can be linked directly to the Kremlin, the frequency of these murders and their effects on Russian independent media certainly suggest complacency on the part of law enforcement officials.\nThe Remembrance Day of Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty in Russia is observed on 15 December every year.\n\nMethodology\nAmong international monitors, the figures quoted for deaths of journalists in Russia have varied, sometimes considerably. There are several explanations. Firstly, certain organisations are concerned with all aspects of safety in news gathering so the International Federation of Journalists and the International News Safety Institute also record accidents that have occurred at work. Secondly, some monitoring bodies include only fatalities in crossfire and dangerous assignments and those murders where they feel sure of the motive behind the lethal attack and can with confidence lobby the appropriate government; the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) adopts this approach. Thirdly, the term \"journalist\" is used by monitors as a general term to cover many different occupations within the media. Some include support staff, others do not.\nIn any list of deaths, compiled by monitors inside or outside the country, Russia ranks near the top for deaths. When the killing began, the brief First Chechen War took numerous journalists' lives from within Chechnya and abroad. There were also increased peacetime deaths of journalists elsewhere in the Russian Federation.\nThose deliberately targeted for their work tended to be reporters, correspondents, and editors. In Russia many directors of new regional TV and radio stations have been murdered but some of these deaths are thought to relate to conflicting business interests. Photographers and cameramen are vulnerable in crossfire situations, such as the October 1993 days in Moscow and the armed conflict in the North Caucasus.\n\n2009 reports on deaths of journalists in Russia\nIn June 2009, a wide-ranging investigation by the International Federation of Journalists into the deaths of journalists in Russia was published. At the same time, the IFJ launched an online database which documents over three hundred deaths and disappearances since 1993. Both the report Partial Justice (Russian version: Частичное правосудие) and the database depend on the information gathered in Russia over the last 16 years by the country's own media monitors: the Glasnost Defense Foundation and the Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations.\nIn September, in the report Justice, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) repeated its conclusion that Russia was one of the deadliest countries in the world for journalists and added that it remains among the worst at solving their murders. Journalists died or were killed, the CPJ argued, because of the work they were doing and only one case has led to a partially successful prosecution.\nFollowing Russia's media monitors, the IFJ database of deaths and disappearances in Russia takes into account the entire range of media occupations and every degree of uncertainty as to the motive for many of the attacks. It also allows for selection and analysis. It classifies the way in which a journalist died (homicide, accident, crossfire, terrorist act, or not confirmed) and it assesses each death as certainly, possibly, or most probably not, linked to the journalist's work.\nSince the early 1990s, Russia's media monitors have recorded every violent or suspicious death that came to their attention. Determining which were linked to the journalist's work has not always been easy since law enforcement agencies in Russia were struggling to cope with a wave of murders and the number of unsolved killings of journalists steadily mounted. In the last few years, the Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations has gathered all available information about these deaths on its Memoriam site. This made it possible to check how much these deaths have been investigated and how many have led to court cases. The IFJ data base summarises the information accumulated on the Memoriam site and makes it available in English for the first time. During a study of international fraud-detection homicide, which compared fraud detection homicide cases from the United States of America against fraud detection homicide cases from the former Soviet Republic, the murder of Paul Klebenikov illustrated a case of a contract killing of a journalist known to expose fraud in governments.  At the time of his murder, he was thought to be investigating complex money laundering fraud scheme involving Chechen reconstruction projects. The investigation appears to reveal that Klebnikov had discovered that the fraud reached deep into the centers of power in the Kremlin, elements involving organized crime, and also the former KGB, now known as the FSB.\n\nPartial Justice and Anatomy of Injustice\nThe IFJ report Partial Justice maps the changing contours of impunity in Russia. It shows and explains the process whereby particular deaths are selected by the IFJ, CPJ, and other monitors. It stresses the need for an end to total impunity in those remaining regions (the North Caucasus, St Petersburg) where no one has ever been prosecuted for killing a journalist, and for an advance beyond partial justice in those cases where it is known, or strongly suspected, that the murder of a journalist was planned and premeditated. It is not enough to put the killer on trial; they must be accompanied, or followed, by their accomplices, and the intermediaries and individuals who ordered and paid for the killing.\nThe IFJ report opens and closes with the Politkovskaya murder and the subsequent trial, which ran from November 2008 to February 2009. After 16 years of unsolved killings, the international outcry over her death made this a test case that might finally breach the barrier of partial justice. The evidence presented by the prosecution, unfortunately, did not convince the jury or satisfy other key participants. Anatomy of Injustice, the report by the CPJ, displays the conclusions the committee has reached about certain deaths since 2000: the authorities do not acknowledge some of these deaths as homicide, while several others reached the courts but have led at most to the conviction of the perpetrator, not those who ordered the killing.\nFollowing different routes the two reports reach a similar set of recommendations. They call on Russian authorities to give investigators and courts the backing they need to identify and pursue all those responsible for the deaths of journalists and, in the meanwhile, to keep the press and the public better informed about their progress in tackling such disturbing crimes.\n\nInternational comparisons\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, the homicide rate in Russia was among the highest in the world. There were over 500 contract killings in Russia in 1994. The committee to Protect Journalists lists Russia as \"the third deadliest country in the world for journalists\" since 1991, exceeded in the number of deaths only by Algeria (1993–1996) and post-invasion Iraq. Setting Russia alongside its G20 partners – not just the US and France, but also Saudi Arabia and China (see Table 1, in the IFJ report). Russia's problem, shared by certain other members of G20 (India, Brazil, and Mexico), is not simply one of the number of deaths but the persistence of killing with impunity continuing over many years. The varied conditions in these economically important countries highlight a further crucial dimension. The killing of journalists may be the most dramatic and frequently quoted \"barometer of press freedom\" but it is by no means the only measure. What it signifies for a particular country can only be properly gauged in the wider context of press freedom and other liberties, present (or absent) in that society. Very few journalists have been killed in China and none, it would seem, in North Korea. Other shortcomings ensure those countries occupy a lower position than Russia on any index of press freedom.\nMikhail Beketov initially survived a 2008 attack and died five years later. Immediate death is the extreme end of the spectrum of threats and intimidation.\n\nDeaths and trials, statistics\nThe violent deaths of journalists began in the Boris Yeltsin era (1991–1999) and continued under Vladimir Putin, president of Russia from 31 December 1999 to 7 May 2008. When Medvedev became president, he spoke of the need to end \"legal nihilism\". From 2003 to 2008, there were a rising number of trials but by November 2009 there had yet to be a major breakthrough, under President Dmitri Medvedev, of either in the prosecution of pre-2008 deaths or the investigation of killings since his May 2008 inauguration. The Politkovskaya murder trial and the first arrests in the Baburova-Markelov slaying (November 2009) showed some inconclusive signs of movement.\n\nThe yearly figures in the table above are derived from the \"journalists in Russia\" database, where details can be found on each individual death. Certain important categories are not included. Those who have gone \"missing\" (14 persons); those who died in an incident (\"not confirmed\", 28 persons), the nature of which has not been satisfactorily established; and journalists killed in work-related accidents (37 persons), may be found online in the IFJ database.\nThe third set of figures indicates the yearly number of verdicts reached in trials for the killing of journalists. With only three exceptions these have all been for homicide. Some cases have taken six to seven years to reach court (e.g. the killings of Dmitry Kholodov and Igor Domnikov) but most deaths that have resulted in prosecution take, on average, 12–24 months between the killing and the verdict.\nRates of conviction are a different matter. When the death was not related to the journalist's work the conviction rate exceeds 90%. When the journalist's death was certainly or seems likely to have been related to his or her work, the rate of acquittals rise sharply to around half of the total. Most trials are still held before a judge, aided by two lay assessors. Trial by judge and jury, which is still very rare in Russia, generally offers a more rigorous testing of evidence, robust defence of the suspects, and a higher chance of the defendant being found not guilty (average acquittal rate of 20%). The Politkovskaya murder trial, which was held before a jury, ended in February 2009 with the acquittal of all those accused.\nIf approximately three-quarters of journalists' murders over the past 16 years were not related to their investigations and publications However, the CJES considers that up to 70% of assaults, which annually run into the dozens, are work-related. Sometimes these are very serious. In November 2008, Mikhail Beketov, chief editor of the Khimkinskaya pravda, a paper in a Moscow suburb, was beaten so severely that although he survived, and his paper even resumed limited publication, by early 2010 he had still not regained the power of speech or independent movement. He died in 2013.\n\nConcern abroad\nSince Vladimir Putin first became prime minister in 1999 (president from 2000), the Russian authorities have been urged repeatedly by Western governments and international media bodies to do more to investigate the deaths of journalists. The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders frequently criticized Russia for what it described as a failure to investigate these murders. The organization further claimed that many of the murdered journalists had been critical of Russian President Putin. Between March 2000 and July 2007, Reporters Without Borders claimed 21 journalists were murdered in Russia because of their work.\nSimilar figures were produced by the committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). In a June 2007 statement, the CPJ said, \"A total of 47 journalists have been killed in Russia since 1992, with the vast majority of killings unsolved,\". Seventeen of these journalists had been killed \"in the line of duty\" since 2000: 14 were murdered in retaliation for their journalism, \"two died in crossfire; and one was killed while covering a dangerous assignment\". The CPJ was continuing to investigate the deaths of eight other journalists to see if there was a link between their murder and their work. According to the CPJ, none of the 14 murders committed since 2000 had been solved and \"13 bear the marks of contract hits\".\nPressure on the Russian authorities increased in late 2006 after the murder of Anna Politkovskaya. In June 2007, the board of the World Association of Newspapers passed a resolution, calling on the authorities in Russia to \"investigate journalist deaths more vigorously\":\n\nThe brutal murder on 7 October 2006 of Novaya Gazeta journalist Anna Politkovskaya, known for her critical reporting on the conflict in Chechnya in which she sought to expose human rights abuses, was yet another reminder to Russian journalists that violence awaits those who investigate or criticise. It is estimated that 21 journalists have been killed since Russian President Vladimir Putin came to power in March 2000. In the great majority of cases, no one has been convicted and sentenced for the murders.\nOn 18 June 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed House Resolution 151, calling on Putin to \"step-up efforts to investigate\" the murders. In a report published in 2007, the International News Safety Institute said more journalists had died violent deaths in Russia in the previous 10 years than anywhere in the world apart from Iraq, though it offered statistics rather than details of the individual victims. The British New Statesman magazine's website, which it described as \"solidarity with the dead, and in association with Amnesty International, Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and Index on Censorship\" published a list of 40 Russian journalists killed since 1993, representing only some of those who died.\n\nLegal outcomes\nImmediately after Politkovskaya's murder doubts were expressed about the chances of justice being done, even though the victim in this case was a journalist who had acquired a worldwide reputation (cf. Dmitry Kholodov in 1994). American commentator Anne Applebaum thought that the murderers of Politkovskaya would never be found.\nRecent killings, in various parts of Russia, of Ilyas Shurpayev, Yury Shebalkin, Konstantin Borovko and Leonid Etkind did indeed lead to trials and convictions. This was also true of some of the men involved in the brutal, earlier murder of 23-year-old Internet journalist Vladimir Sukhomlin. Ilya Zimin's alleged killer, meanwhile, was tried in his native Moldova and acquitted. Yet these examples do not disprove the charge of partial justice since only one of the deaths was related beyond doubt to the journalistic work of the victim.\nCriticism from abroad was frequently perceived and rejected as selective. However, Russia's sought-for status as a member of G8 from 1997 onwards set a benchmark that showed the continuing deaths of journalists, and of other media restrictions within the country, in an unfavourable light. Also of importance was the country's admission to the Council of Europe and, as a result, the potential involvement, after 1998, of the European Court of Human Rights as an arbiter of last resort. Unsuccessful attempts were made for the 2004 acquittal of Dmitry Kholodov's alleged killers to be examined in Strasbourg. So far the Court has only once determined the failure of the Russian authorities to pursue those responsible for the violent deaths of journalists. In 2005 it ruled that the October 1999 killing in Chechnya of cameramen Ramzan Mezhidov and Shamil Gigayev and of more than thirty other civilians who died during the same incident had not been properly investigated.\n\nList of journalists killed in Russia\nWhat follows is a list of journalists (reporters, editors, cameramen, photographers) who have been killed in Russia since 1992.

        "content": "Brimstone is a 2016 psychological Western film written and directed by Martin Koolhoven. The film stars Dakota Fanning, Guy Pearce, Emilia Jones, Kit Harington, and Carice van Houten. It is a Dutch-American as well as French, German, Belgian and Swedish international production. \nThe film was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival on 3 September 2016, where it caused controversy. It premiered in the Netherlands on 12 January 2017, where it was very well received, as in the rest of Europe and was released on 10 March in the United States, where it received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nPlot\nThe plot consists of four acts, which are presented in anachronic order. The chronological order is Acts 3 (Genesis), 2 (Exodus), 1 (Revelation), and 4 (Retribution). So, after the first act, Revelation, the following acts are what happened before and the fourth act is chronologically the last.\n1. Revelation\nElizabeth \"Liz\" Brundy lives in the Old West with her husband Eli and their two children: Matthew, Eli's son from a previous marriage, and daughter Samantha, called Sam.\nLiz works as a midwife who can hear but is mute, and so communicates through sign language. One day, a new Preacher, known as \"The Reverend\", hosts a session at the local church, and the moment that Liz hears his voice, she seems to recognize him and is terrified by his appearance. Later that day, Liz is forced to choose between delivering a baby safely or saving its mother; she chooses to euthanise the baby and save the mother, without telling her until after the procedure is finished. Afterwards, Nathan, the husband of the formerly-pregnant woman, blames Liz. That night, Nathan drunkenly shows up at Eli and Liz's house, violent and threatening; Nathan claims Liz is responsible for his son's death. In the middle of the fight, the Reverend shows up and tells him to leave. He then goes into Eli's house and has a mysterious talk with Liz, saying she is guilty of the murder of Nathan's son and must be \"punished\". As Eli overhears some of the conversation, the Reverend leaves the house. Eli's sheep are found dead the next morning, and he seeks out Nathan, who has since disappeared. Liz later sneaks off at night to murder the Reverend, but finds her daughter's doll in the Reverend's bed instead. Meanwhile, the Reverend disembowels Eli, and leaves him to die. As he succumbs to his wounds, Eli tells Matthew to take the family up into the mountains to his father, before the boy mercy kills him. Liz and the children flee the farm.\n2.

She is protected by Sally, a prostitute, until she is hanged for shooting a violent customer; another prostitute, Elizabeth, then protects Joanna in the aftermath of Sally's hanging. However, when Elizabeth bites the tongue of an abusive customer, her tongue is cut off as punishment. Joanna teaches Elizabeth sign language from a book the doctor gave her. Elizabeth plans to sneak out of Bismuth to start a new life, and arranges through a marriage broker to marry Eli. The Reverend comes to the brothel, recognizes Joanna, and proceeds to violently abuse her. Elizabeth saves Joanna but is murdered by the Reverend with Joanna slashing his throat in retaliation. She runs away, cutting off her own tongue and taking Elizabeth's place with Eli.\n3. Genesis\nIn the desert, two badly wounded men, Samuel and Wolf, are the last survivors in a dispute over gold that has left several other men dead. They depart on a single horse.\nJoanna lives with her mother, Anna, and father, revealed to be the Reverend himself. He is strictly religious and is often cruel and abusive towards his family. Samuel and Wolf collapse at the farm and Joanna secretly cares for them. Anna confronts the Reverend when she realizes he lusts after their daughter, so he beats and humiliates her by placing a scold's bridle on her head. In response, Anna commits suicide in full view of the church congregation. The next day the Reverend takes Joanna to church and starts to perform a wedding ceremony between himself and his daughter. Samuel tries to rescue her, but the Reverend murders him. Her father whips Joanna and rapes her. In the morning she runs off.\n4. Retribution\nMatthew is shot by the Reverend as he follows Liz to her father-in-law's place in the mountains. He murders her father-in-law and tells Liz he will beat and rape her daughter, but Liz murders him instead. Sometime later, after Liz has turned Eli's place into a sawmill, Nathan arrives to arrest her. The Reverend had sent him to Bismuth where he became a deputy and then sheriff. Having found a wanted poster of Elizabeth Brundy (the woman without a tongue who killed Frank before she saved Liz/Joanna), Nathan has come to arrest her (Liz). As Nathan is escorting her onto a ferry, with a last look at her daughter playing on the shore, Liz throws herself in the lake and drowns. Her daughter Sam, now a grown woman with a child of her own, remembers her well.\n\nCast\nProduction\nOn 5 February 2015, Guy Pearce and Mia Wasikowska were the first to be announced as part of the cast of the film. Later, Robert Pattinson came on board to portray an outlaw along with Carice van Houten.\nIn May 2015, Koolhoven confirmed that Jack Roth had joined the cast of the film. In June 2015, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that Dakota Fanning and Kit Harington had replaced Wasikowska and Pattinson in the film, respectively. In 2017, Pattinson said he regretted not doing Brimstone and called it \"his own stupid fault\".\nPrincipal photography began from 15 June 2015, and took place in Germany, Hungary, Austria and Spain.\n\nRelease\nBrimstone's first commercial release was in The Netherlands on 12 January 2017, becoming Martin Koolhoven's fifth consecutive hit film. The film was also released on 10 March 2017, in selected theaters and video on demand in the United States. It was sold to more than 80 countries in the world, making it the best-sold Dutch movie ever.\n\nFestival screenings\nBrimstone was shown in competition at the Venice Film Festival. After Venice, the film had its North American premiere as a Special Presentation at the Toronto International Film Festival where it received positive reviews. as it later did in other festivals like the Sitges Film Festival.\n\nCritical reception\nIn The Netherlands, the film received generally positive reviews from critics and opened strongly. The readers of True West Magazine chose the movie as Best Foreign Western Movie. Koolhoven won the Gouden Pen (Golden Pen) for the screenplay and the Gouden Film (Golden Film) for the film. On 29 September 2017, Brimstone won six Golden Calves (often called \"The Dutch Oscars\") at the Netherlands Film Festival, breaking the old record of four.\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 45% based on 76 reviews and the average rating is 4.90/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 45 based on 17 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". While The Independent wrote \"Brimstone is raw and very powerful filmmaking, a movie that can't help but get under your skin\", Variety wrote it was \"highfalutin exploitation\", blaming it on the Netherlands, writing, \"It is, after all, a country that ever since the 1960s, especially in Amsterdam, has profferred a more liberal view than almost any other place of what might euphemistically be termed 'youthful sexuality'.\" Glenn Kenny of RogerEbert.com referred to the film as \"dimwitted, amoral exploitation\" and accused Koolhoven of identifying most with the murderous and incestuous Reverend. Kevin Maher of The Times UK called it \"an exploitation western that veers from self-importance to high camp.\"\nBrimstone was released in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2017, and was well received by the British press. Empire gave it four stars and called it \"white-knuckle tense\", and Peter Bradshaw wrote in The Guardian: \"This epically long, lurid, violent western from Dutch film-maker Martin Koolhoven has a kind of Tarantino-ish prolixity and narrative ingenuity. Despite its very indulgent length, it never bores.\"\n\nAwards\nNominated – Golden Lion, Venice Film Festival\nWinner – Golden Film\nWinner – Golden Pen, Martin Koolhoven\nNominated – Best Film in the Official Competition, London Film Festival\nNominated – PFS Award (Human Rights), Political Film Society\nNominated – Audience Award (Best Narrative Feature), Palm Springs International Film Festival\nWinner – Best Foreign Western Movie chosen by the readers of True West Magazine\nWinner – Ensor Award, Beste Co-productie at the Ostend Film Festival\nNominated – Golden Calf, Carice van Houten, Best Actress in a supporting Role, Netherlands Film Festival\nNominated – Golden Calf, Job ter Burg, Best Editing, Netherlands Film Festival\nNominated – Golden Calf, Martin Koolhoven, Best Screenplay, Netherlands Film Festival\nWinner – Golden Calf, Floris Vos, Best Production Design, Netherlands Film Festival\nWinner – Golden Calf, Tom Holkenborg, Best Music, Netherlands Film Festival\nWinner – Golden Calf, Herman Pieëte, Best Sound Design, Netherlands Film Festival\nWinner – Golden Calf, Rogier Stoffers, Best Director of Photography, Netherlands Film Festival\nWinner – Golden Calf, Martin Koolhoven, Best Direction, Netherlands Film Festival\nWinner – Golden Calf, Els Vandevorst, Best Film, Netherlands Film Festival\nNominated – Best Feature Length Film, Official Fantastic Competition, Sitges Film Festival\nNominated – Best Film, International Ecumenical Award, Jameson CineFest – Miskolc International Film Festival\nNominated – Golden Frog, Rogier Stoffers, The International Film Festival of the Art of Cinematography Camerimage\nWinner – European Film Award, Leendert van Nimwegen, European Hair & Makeup Artist, European Film Academy\nWinner – Beste Dutch Film 2017, Circle of Dutch Film Journalists (KNF)\nNominated – Zilveren Krulstaart, Martin Koolhoven, Best Feature, Screenplay Award\nWinner – DirectorsNL Award, Martin Koolhoven, Best Feature, Director's Award given by DDG and Vevam Members\nNominated – Saturn Award for Best International Film\nWinner – Best Feature, Almeria Western Film Festival\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBrimstone at IMDb\nBrimstone at Rotten Tomatoes\nBrimstone at Metacritic"

        "content": "Pine Island Bayou is a tributary of the Neches River located in southeast Texas. It runs about 55 miles from the northwest corner of Hardin County, Texas and flows in a southeastern direction through western Hardin County, turning east and defining the southern Hardin and Jefferson County boundary for about 20 miles until its confluence with the Neches River. Two significant tributaries of Pine Island Bayou are Mayhaw Creek and Little Pine Island Bayou. The lower ten miles of Pine Island Bayou and much of Little Pine Island Bayou are protected from development in the Big Thicket National Preserve. Excluding the last few miles north of Beaumont, the area is not densely populated, and some small towns include Sour Lake and Saratoga, the latter the birthplace of country singer George Jones.\n\nGeography and biodiversity\nThe Pine Island Bayou drainage basin is the very heart of the Big Thicket. The basin is sometimes referred to as the \"Traditional Thicket\" or \"The Old Bear Hunters' Thicket\" and it has a high diversity of flora and fauna. It is a flat, low-lying region of floodplains and bottomland, with sluggish blackwater. The areas is characterized by swamps, cypress sloughs, hardwood bottomland, palmetto-oak flats, and baygalls. Some typical flora include water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) and bald cypress trees (Taxodium distichum) draped with Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides); rattan-vine (Berchemia scandens) and muscadine vine (Vitis rotundifolia) climbing through forest of black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), water hickory (Carya aquatica), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and several species of oak trees such as overcup oak (Quercus lyrata), laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia), willow oak (Quercus phellos), and water oak (Quercus nigra).  Dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor) may fill the understory in some areas.\nThe black bear (Ursus americanus) once common in the area were extirpated by the first few years of the 20th century. A few of the animals found in the area include northern river otter (Lontra canadensis), bobcat (Lynx rufus), American beaver (Castor canadensis), American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii), cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus), and several species of non-venomous watersnake (Nerodia). One source stated that Pine Island Bayou had a total of 56 species of fish on record, including alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula), bowfin (Amia calva), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), yellow bullhead (Ictalurus natalis), warmouth (Lepomis gulosus), and bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus).\n\nFurther reading\nList of rivers of Texas\n\"An Analysis of Texas Waterways\".

        "content": "John Erickson, FRSE, FBA, FRSA (17 April 1929 – 10 February 2002) was a British historian and defence expert who wrote extensively on the Second World War. His two best-known books – The Road to Stalingrad and The Road to Berlin – dealt with the Soviet response to the German invasion of the Soviet Union, covering the period from 1941 to 1945. He was respected for his knowledge of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. His Russian language skills and knowledge gained him respect.\n\nEducation and career\nJohn Erickson was born on 17 April 1929 in the town of South Shields (then part of County Durham), England. He was educated at South Shields High School for Boys and St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA Hons.\nHe became a research fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford, from 1956 until 1958, during which he met his future wife Ljubica Petrovic, a young Yugoslavian attending Oxford to read English. At the culmination of their courtship, they sought the permission of the Yugoslav cultural attache before their wedding in 1957.\nProfessor Erickson then taught at the universities of St. Andrews in 1958, Manchester in 1962 and then Indiana in 1964 before becoming a reader in higher defence studies at the University of Edinburgh in 1967. In 1969, he became Professor of Defence Studies, a position he held until 1988, where he founded and was the head of the Centre for Defence Studies. From 1988 to 1996 he was the director of the Centre for Defence Studies.\nErickson wrote of his research for his two-volume history of Stalin's war with Germany that he was surprised with the extent of personal archives (lichnye arkhivy) held by former Red Army soldiers of many ranks, and:  \n\n\" .. that there is no substitute for having the late Marshal Koniev – spectacles perched on nose – read from his own personal notebook, detailing operational orders, his own personal instructions to select commanders and his tally of Soviet casualties. And while on the subject of casualties, Marshal Koniev made it plain that, though such figurers did exist, he was not prepared on his own authority to allow certain figures to be released for publication while a number of commanders were still alive. As for such figures as were published, I was assured by expert and thoroughly professional Soviet military historians that these were reliable, which is to say that they were the product of intensive and painstaking research . The comment on them or the implications of the figures were presumably a different matter. It was all the more useful, therefore, to have the opportunity to discuss these findings with Soviet military historians, on the basis of their work with formal and informal sources.\"\n\nEdinburgh Conversations\nThe Edinburgh Conversations were a series of meetings that took place between 1983 and 1989 between prominent political & military leaders in Western countries and their Soviet counterparts. The purpose of the meetings were to allow face-to-face dialogue to take place in a neutral setting. The first Soviet delegation included the editor of Pravda and two army generals.\n\nOrigin\nThe UK formally suspended diplomatic contact with the Soviet Union after the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. Erickson sought to maintain a forum of discussion between the West and the Soviet Union. The setting alternated between Edinburgh and Moscow. Although both sides approached the initial meeting with suspicion, the knowledge of Erickson and his insistence upon \"academic rules\" contributed to their ongoing success.\n\nImpact\nIn recognition of Erickson's achievement, Sir Michael Eliot Howard declared that ‘Nobody deserves more credit for the ultimate dissolution of the misunderstandings that brought the Cold War to an end and enabled the peoples of Russia and their western neighbours to live in peace.’\n\nPublications\nThe Soviet High Command 1918-1941: A Military-Political History 1918-1941, St Martin's Press (Macmillan), London, 1962\nPanslavism, Routledge & Kegan Paul, for The Historical Association, London, 1964\nThe Military-Technical Revolution, Praeger, New York, 1966 (Revised and updated papers from a symposium held at the Institute for the Study of the USSR, Munich, Oct. 1964)\nSoviet Military Power, Royal United Services Institute, London, 1976\nSoviet Military Power and Performance, Palgrave Macmillan Press, London, 1979 ISBN 0-333-22081-1\nThe Road to Stalingrad, Stalin's War with Germany, Volume 1, Harper & Row, Publishers, New York 1975 ISBN 0-06-011141-0\nThe Road to Stalingrad, Stalin's War with Germany, Volume 1, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London 1975, 1983\nThe Road to Berlin.

        "content": "The Diocese of Port Elizabeth is a diocese in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa. The diocese was founded in 1970.\n\nHistory\nThe British garrison of Port Elizabeth saw the arrival of 500 settlers in 1825, which included Francis McClelland, who was appointed the same year Colonial Chaplain. It was also laid the foundation stone of the Collegiate Church of St. Mary the Virgin, who only would be opened for worship in 1832. The Anglican Diocese of Port Elizabeth was created in 1970, being his first bishop, Philip Russell, until 1974. The diocese supported the anti-apartheid campaign under his tenure and the one of his successor, Bruce Evans. He was followed by Eric Pike, who would be in office from 1993 to 2001. Bethlehem Nopece was elected as the first black bishop of the diocese in 2001, which he was until 29 July 2018.\n\nList of bishops\nPhilip Russell, 1970-1974\nBruce Read Evans, 1975-1993\nEric Pike, 1993-2001\nBethlehem Nopece, 2001–2018\nEddie Daniels, 2019-\n\nCoat of arms\nThe diocese registered a coat of arms at the Bureau of Heraldry in 1977 : Argent, on a cross  Gules,  between  in  dexter  chief  an  anchor, in sinister chief a cross moline, in  dexter base a clay pot and in sinister base a  triangle  Sable  voided of the field, a lamb couchant proper, the shield ensigned with a mitre proper.\n\nAnglican realignment\nThe diocese is theologically conservative.

        "content": "What Happened is a 2017 memoir by Hillary Clinton about her experiences as the Democratic Party's nominee and general election candidate for president of the United States in the 2016 election. Published on September 12, 2017, it is her seventh book with her publisher, Simon & Schuster.\nA paperback edition featuring a new afterword was released in September 2018, as was a Spanish translation titled Lo que pasó.\n\nInception and advance publicity\nExistence of a new Clinton work was first revealed in February 2017, but at the time it was billed as a volume of essays centered around the author's favorite sayings, with only some allusions to the campaign. Financial terms of that work, which had no announced title, were not publicly disclosed but industry observers expected her monetary compensation to be large. The new purposing of the work and its thematic substance were revealed in July 2017. After the title was announced, it was parodied with memes on Twitter.\nThe New York Times wrote that the stated aim of the book was to offer an intimate view of what it was like for Clinton to run as the first female presidential candidate from a major party in United States history, in an often vicious and turbulent campaign. This is her third memoir, following Living History in 2003 and Hard Choices in 2014; advance publicity for the work said it would be her \"most personal\" yet and quoted from her words in the book's Introduction: \"In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I've often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net. Now I'm letting my guard down.\" Clinton promised a new level of candor as a major theme of the initial publicity surrounding the book. The work was also said to include some self-help ideas about how to get past highly unpleasant experiences.\n\nContents\nWhat Happened is a first-person account dedicated to \"the team that stood with me in 2016,\" and one of its chapters is largely a list of everyone who worked on her campaign. It is organized into six main parts, titled: Perseverance, Competition, Sisterhood, Idealism and Realism, Frustration, and Resilience. Each part has from two to five chapters within it.\nAfter the introduction, the book opens with a scene from the United States presidential inauguration of 2017, attended by Clinton and her husband, where she watched President Donald Trump take office. She begins:\n\nDeep breath. Feel the air fill my lungs. This is the right thing to do. The country needs to see that our democracy still works, no matter how painful this is. Breathe out. Scream later.\nIn the next chapter, \"Get Caught Trying,\" she starts with her reasoning for running:  I ran for President because I thought I'd be good at the job. I thought that of all the people who might run, I had the most relevant experience, meaningful accomplishments, and ambitious but achievable proposals, as well as the temperament to get things done in Washington.\nFurther in, she elaborates: \n\nIt was the chance to do the most good I would ever be able to do. In just one day at the White House, you can get more done for more people than in months anywhere else. We had to build an economy that worked for everyone. We had to take on serious national security threats. These issues were already on my mind all the time.... I knew I would make the most of every minute. Once I started thinking about it that way, I couldn't stop.\nIn the book, she defends her campaign, saying they were economical with travel expenses, snacks, and office supplies. \"Our national campaign staff [were] living and working on a tight budget...\" She revealed that the average donation was $100 and that the majority were from women.\nShe also describes campaigning in hostile areas of the country, like Mingo County, West Virginia, \"Ground Zero for the coal crisis.\" She describes being taken aback by the level of anger she was met there with. She wrote, \"This wasn't just about my comments in one town hall. This was something deeper.\"\nIn the book, also, Clinton tries to explain the combination of factors that led to her electoral loss, including James Comey, Vladimir Putin, Mitch McConnell, The New York Times, NBC, WikiLeaks, the  American media as a whole, sexism, white resentment, Bernie Sanders and his supporters, Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and herself, specifically her comments on putting \"coal miners out of business\" and labeling some of her opponent's supporters as a \"basket of deplorables\". \nShe noted that President Obama worried that extending the handover process after Trump's win would be bad for the country. She wrote \"After so much hand-wringing about Trump undermining our democracy by not pledging to accept the results, the pressure was on us to do it right. If I was going to lose, the President wanted me to concede quickly and gracefully. It was hard to think straight, but I agreed with him.\"\nThe book contains a number of Clinton's policy proposals, featuring her analysis of a problem area and her ideas for how to solve it like resolving the issues of climate change and securing the vote. It also says though she was ecstatic about Barack Obama's win in 2008, \"in some ways, the [moment with Trump as president] now feels even more hopeful, because it is a battle-hardened hope, tempered by loss and clear-eyed about the stakes.... We are doing the work.\"\nAnother subject of the book is how to get through difficult experiences. Clinton discusses her practice of yoga and her liking of chardonnay, but in particular, she lists a large number of books that helped her cope with the loss in one way or another. These included mysteries by Louise Penny, Jacqueline Winspear, Donna Leon, and Caroline and Charles Todd. They also included the Neapolitan Novels of Elena Ferrante, the spiritual works of Henri Nouwen, and the collected poems of Maya Angelou, Marge Piercy and T. S. Eliot.\nWhat Happened  closes with a scene from a speech she gave at her alma mater Wellesley College. Clinton concludes it with the advice to readers to \"Keep going.\"\n\nSales\nDomestic sales\nThe hardcover edition was published on September 12, 2017; it immediately went to the top of the Barnes & Noble, Amazon, and USA Today bestseller lists. The book debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller List for both hardcover nonfiction and combined print and e-book nonfiction sales, remaining atop the lists for it stayed for two weeks.  It dropped to number two on both lists in its third week. By the beginning of November it had spent six weeks in the top four positions of the list. By the beginning of January 2018 the book had spent sixteen weeks on the list. The following week it fell off. The book debuted at number one of the Publishers Weekly \"Top 10 overall\" and \"hardcover nonfiction\" bestseller lists.  In its third week on the lists, it dropped to number three of the \"Top 10 overall\" and to number two of the \"hardcover nonfiction\" lists with a total of 311,982 hardcover copies sold.\nWhat Happened sold 300,000 copies in its first week. The first-week sales were lower than her 2003 memoir, Living History, but triple the first-week sales of Clinton's previous memoir, 2014's Hard Choices. The first-week hardcover sales for What Happened were 167,000. This marked the strongest hardcover debut for a nonfiction book since 2012's No Easy Day. Simon & Schuster also announced that What Happened sold more e-books in its first-week than any nonfiction book had since 2010.  As of December 10, 2017, the book had sold 448,947 hardcover copies.\nAfter its paperback, rerelease, the book debuted at #9 on The New York Times Best Sellers' \"Paperback Nonfiction\" list.\n\nInternational sales\nWhat Happened also performed strongly in its release outside of the United States. In the United Kingdom, What Happened debuted atop The Sunday Times bestseller list.\nIn Ireland, the book was able to peak atop the Nielsen BookScan component chart for hardcover non-fiction. On the primary Irish Nielsen BookScan chart tracking sales of both hardcover and paperback books in all genres, What Happened debuted at number ten (selling 767 copies). It jumped to number seven in its second week (selling 800 copies). It jumped further to number four in its third week (selling 1,117 copies). In its fourth week it dropped to number six (however with consistent sales, selling 1,116 copies). It exited the top-ten in its seventh week.\nIn Canada, What Happened debuted atop The Globe and Mail's  hardcover non-fiction best sellers list. It remained on the chart for six consecutive weeks. In New Zealand, What Happened debuted number 8 on Nielsen BookScan's \"International Non-fiction - Adults\" chart. In Australia, the book charted on Books+Publishing's bestsellers chart.\n\nCritical reception\nWhat Happened polarized book critics.\nJennifer Senior of The New York Times said:\n\nWhat Happened is not one book, but many. It is a candid and blackly funny account of her mood in the direct aftermath of losing to President Donald J. Trump. It is a post-mortem, in which she is both coroner and corpse. It is a feminist manifesto. It is a score-settling jubilee. It is a rant against James B. Comey, Bernie Sanders, the media, James B. Comey, Vladimir Putin and James B. Comey. It is a primer on Russian spying. It is a thumping of Trump.\nFor Washington Post writer David Weigel noted that Clinton \"apologizes to the reader, who has to relive all of this. 'It wasn't healthy or productive,' she writes, 'to dwell on the ways I felt I'd been shivved.' It's a perfect word, 'shivved.' The Hillary Clinton of this bitter memoir ... again and again ... blames herself for losing, apologizing for her 'dumb' email management, for giving paid speeches to banks, for saying she would put coal miners 'out of business.' She veers between regret and righteous, sometimes in the same paragraph.\"\nA review in the Chicago Tribune by Heidi Stevens stated that the passages in the book about Russia's involvement in the US election \"read like a spy novel\". Thomas Frank in The Guardian contends that \"Unfortunately, her new book is less an effort to explain than it is to explain away. ... Still, by exercising a little discernment, readers can find clues to the mystery of 2016 here and there among the clouds of blame-evasion and positive thinking.\"\nAn analysis by Ezra Klein, editor-in-chief of Vox, saw a different role for the book, making reference to Clinton's belief that progress is best made by working within the political system: \"What Happened has been sold as Clinton's apologia for her 2016 campaign, and it is that. But it's more remarkable for Clinton's extended defense of a political style that has become unfashionable in both the Republican and Democratic parties.\"\nDavid L. Ulin of the Los Angeles Times wrote in his review for the newspaper that the book is a \"necessary—if at times clunky and unconvincing—retrospective\" and that \"She should have been president, and she knows it; regret and loss is palpable throughout the book. And yet it's also the case that she remains unable to reckon with just what happened in the 2016 election, looking for explanations, for reasons, while at the same time never quite uncovering her own complicity.\"\nSarah Jones of The New Republic wrote: \n\nThe real problem with What Happened is that it is not the book it needed to be. It spends more time on descriptions of Clinton's various post-election coping strategies, which include chardonnay and \"alternative nostril breathing,\" than it does on her campaign decisions in the Midwest. It is written for her fans, in other words, and not for those who want real answers about her campaign, and who worry that the Democratic Party is learning the wrong lessons from the 2016 debacle.\nJeff Greenfield wrote in Politico Magazine that the book suggests \"that the person we've seen over the past quarter-century, and the person we watched seek the presidency twice, is the authentic Hillary. In fact, to judge by her book, she may have been the most authentic person in the race.\"\nA 2019 study in the journal Perspectives on Politics tried to evaluate the veracity of reasons that Clinton presented for her loss in the 2016 election. The study found that \"more often than not, HRC’s assumptions are supported\" but that there was little evidence that the e-mail scandal, including FBI Director James Comey’s intervention shortly before Election Day, contributed to her loss.\n\nAwards and honors\nTime magazine listed What Happened as #1 on its list of the best non-fiction books of 2017. NPR's Book Concierge included What Happened on its list of \"2017's Great Reads.\" What Happened also won the Goodreads Choice Award for Best Memoir & Autobiography.\n\nBook tour\nIt was announced on August 28, 2017, that Hillary Clinton would be starting a North American book tour in September 2017 to promote What Happened, as well as the picture book  It Takes a Village (a new take on that 1996 volume).\nClinton scheduled more than thirty appearances in cities across the United States and Canada as part of an official book tour which lasted through December 2017.\nClinton also traveled to the United Kingdom to promote the book. In part, the events in the U.K. were considered a great success, with tickets being sold out in less than an hour in some places.\nIn May 2018, she took her book tour to New Zealand and Australia.\n\nHillary Clinton: Live\nClinton partook in a series of engagements titled Hillary Clinton: Live. At many of her appearances, Clinton was met with enthusiastic audiences filling multi-thousand-seat venues. Starting prices for general admission tickets ranged from $30 to $125.\n\nBook signings\nIn addition to Hillary Clinton Live events, Clinton also held book signings at locations across the United States as part of her book tour.\nTickets for particular signings sold out very soon after going on sale. For instance, tickets to Clinton's signing at Vroman's Bookstore in Pasadena sold out within ninety minutes. The president of Vroman's Bookstore reported that it was the fastest that the store had ever sold out for an event.\nIn the United States, some of the book tour's stops were located relatively near Chappaqua, New York, where Clinton maintains her personal residence. She also held book signings in California and Colorado.\n\nSee also\nShattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign\n\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\nClinton, Hillary (2017). What Happened.

He also worked for DC Comics, where he provided art for one issue of the comic book Batman Chronicles.\nAt the end of the 1990s, Cruz took a break from working on comic books and returned to Brazil, where he became one of the founders and partners of an art studio/school called Fábrica de Quadrinhos (\"Comic Book Factory\"; currently named Quanta Academia de Artes). Cruz also worked as a storyboard designer for advertising agencies, a character designer for TV shows, and an art teacher, and gave a two-year course of lectures and workshops in universities.\nStill being a Fábrica de Quadrinhos partner, he returned to work for the American market, contributing to Top Cow Productions titles such as The Darkness and Ascension, and Marvel titles like X-Men, Wolverine, and Magneto: Dark Seduction.\nIn 1999 Cruz gave up his projects in Fábrica de Quadrinhos and returned to work exclusively with comics. In 2002, negotiated by Art & Comics Studio, he illustrated issues of Wonder Woman. From 2004, he worked for Marvel once again, as the artist on Amazing Fantasy and X-Men: First Class.\nSince 2019 Cruz published more authorial works in Brazil, such as Xampu- Lovely Losers, Quaisqualingundum (as writer; art by David Calil), based on songs by composer Adoniran Barbosa, A Irmandade Bege e Os Fabulosos, a parody of X-Men.\n\nControversy\nCruz was a regular on the (now defunct) Genesis Comics \"Swipe Of The Week\" website around 1999.  The site placed two pieces of published work by two different artists side by side, and allowed the users to vote whether they were seeing an homage, a coincidence, or a direct copy. Primarily, Cruz's work was placed beside the previously printed work of Joe Madureira, but also Jim Lee. Cruz has acknowledged on his (now defunct) website that he learned to draw primarily by copying from other pencillers.\n\nPartial bibliography\nUncanny X-Men  #315, 318, 320, 324, 327, 376, 473, 474\nX-Factor  #106\nWolverine  #89, #147-148\nX-Men  #180-181\nGeneration X  #7-8\nX-Man  #21-25, 27-30, 32-35, 41-44, -1\nX-Calibre  #2\nX-Men: Alpha/X-Men: Omega\nIncredible Hulk  #419\nBrigade  #16-17\nSilver Surfer Vol. 2  #138-139\nteam youngblood   #18-20\nyoungblood   vol 2: #s 1, 2, 4, 6-11, 14\n\nNotes\nReferences\nOfficial blog\nRoger Cruz at Deviant Art\nLambiek Comiclopedia entry on Cruz"

        "content": "Lake Armor is a fjord lake located on the central plateau of the main island of the Kerguelen archipelago, in the French Southern and Antarctic Lands.\nIt was so named by the Mouzon mission in 1952 after a Breton noun which means \"the land close to the sea\".\nIt extends in a northwesterly south-easterly direction at an altitude of about 1 m, over a length of about 3.7 km (2.3 mi) and a maximum width of 700 m (2,300 ft), covering around 200 ha (490 acres). From the south, a stream passing down the Volcan du Diable feeds the lake, having collected the waters coming from the slopes of the volcano as well as those of the Val d'Enfer and the Val des Trolls, and thus their lakes. Another stream feeds the lake from the north. Lake Armor flows into the marine waters of the Gulf of Morbihan in the Hurley Bay.\nNear the lake is the only known spot in Kerguelen of Elaphoglossum randii, a small fern endemic to the sub-Antarctic islands of the Indian Ocean, which occurs elsewhere only in the Marion and Prince Edward Islands.\nThe southern beaches of Lake Armor are also known for their curious little pebbles, rolled by the waves and nicknamed \"Armor dicks\" because of their evocative shape.\nAn introduction of salmonids has been achieved between 1977 and 1992 in the Lake Armor and its tributaries. The first release of fry occurred in 1977 with Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from Scotland. Such a release was reared in 1978 and 1980. Furthermore, an experiment of salmon farming started in 1984, but this time with Pacific species: mainly Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and also Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). After being raised in floating cages in the freshwater of the lake, the smolts were freed expecting they would come back as adults to their nursery place. In order to monitor this experiment a technical base had been built near the outflow of the lake. The experiment stopped in 1991 and the station was then abandoned. In 1991 and 1992, last releases were done with some young fish of other species: brown trout (Salmo trutta), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) from local acclimated populations and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) native to Haute-Savoie.\nSedimentological surveys were carried out from 2007 in the northern part of Lake Armor to collect information on the climate changings for 1200 years.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Science fiction and fantasy in the Czech Republic has a long and varied history.  From 1918, when Czechoslovakia became independent, until 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded it, Czech literature enjoyed one of its high points.\nCzech writers developed their works as aesthetic pieces rather than as platforms demanding independence for the Czech people.  The best-known and most important of SF writers was Karel Čapek, whose play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) (printed 1920, premiered January 1921), introduced and made popular the frequently used international word robot.\nČapek is perhaps best known as a science fiction author, who wrote before science fiction became established as a separate genre. He can be considered one of the founders of classical, non-hardcore European science fiction, a type which focuses on possible future (or alternative) social and human evolution on Earth, rather than technically advanced stories of space travel. However, it is best to classify him with Aldous Huxley and George Orwell as a mainstream literary figure who used science-fiction motifs.  Many of his works discuss ethical and other aspects of revolutionary inventions and processes that were already anticipated in the first half of 20th century. These include mass production, atomic weapons, and non-human intelligent beings such as robots, space-faring gypsies or intelligent salamanders (in his War with the Newts).\nJosef Nesvadba, writing since the late 1950s, quickly became the best-known Czech SF authors of the post-war generation, being translated into English and German, even though he moved from the SF proper after his first 3 story collections to the fringes of fantastic genre and mainstream.\nThe modern era of Czech SF began in late 1970s, coinciding and soon interacting with the founding of science fiction fandom in 1979.\n\nNotable Czech SF writers\nKarel Čapek\nJosef Nesvadba\nLudvík Souček\nOndřej Neff\nJiří Kulhánek\nMiroslav Žamboch\nJaroslav Velinský\nLucie Lukačovičová\nPetra Neomillnerová\n\nFilm\nSkeleton on Horseback (Bílá nemoc) (1937)\nKrakatit (1948)\nJourney to the Beginning of Time (1955)\nThe Fabulous World of Jules Verne (1958)\nMan in Outer Space (1961)\nThe Cybernetic Grandma (1962)\nVoyage to the End of the Universe (Ikarie XB-1, 1963)\nWho Wants to Kill Jessie?

        "content": "Livorno (Italian: [liˈvorno] ) is a port city on the Ligurian Sea on the western coast of the Tuscany region, Italy. It is the capital of the Province of Livorno, having a population of 158,493 residents in December 2017. It is traditionally known in English as Leghorn (pronounced  leg-ORN,  LEG-horn or  LEG-ərn).\nDuring the Renaissance, Livorno was designed as an \"ideal town\". Developing considerably from the second half of the 16th century by the will of the House of Medici, Livorno was an important free port. Its intense commercial activity was largely dominated by foreign traders. Also the seat of consulates and shipping companies, it became the main port-city of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The high status of a multiethnic and multicultural Livorno lasted until the second half of the nineteenth century, when it was surpassed by other cities. Evidence of that prosperous time can be seen in the many churches, villas, and palaces of the city.\nLivorno is considered to be the most modern among all the Tuscan cities, and is the third most-populous of the region, after Florence and Prato.\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nThe origins of Livorno are controversial, although the place was inhabited since the Neolithic Age. This is documented by the worked bones, and pieces of copper and ceramic found on the Livorno Hills in a cave between Ardenza and Montenero. The Etruscan settlement was called Labro. \nThe construction of the Via Aurelia coincided with the occupation of the region by the Romans. They are also known for their toponyms and the ruins of towers. The natural cove called Liburna is a reference to the type of ship, the liburna, adopted by Roman navy from the Liburnians. Other ancient toponyms include Salviano (Salvius) and Antignano (Ante ignem), which was the place situated before Ardenza (Ardentia), where beacons directed the ships to Porto Pisano. Cicero mentioned Liburna in a letter to his brother, in which he called it Labrone.\n\nMedieval\nLivorna is mentioned for the first time in 1017 as a small coastal village, the port and the remains of a Roman tower under the rule of Lucca. In 1077, a tower was built by Matilda of Tuscany. The Republic of Pisa owned Livorna from 1103 and built a quadrangular fort called Quadratura dei Pisani (\"Quarter of the Pisans\") to defend the port. Porto Pisano was destroyed after the crushing defeat of the Pisan fleet in the Battle of Meloria in 1284. \nIn 1399, Pisa sold Livorna to the Visconti of Milan; in 1405 it was sold to the Republic of Genoa; and on 28 August 1421 it was bought by the Republic of Florence. The name 'Leghorn' was derived from the Genoese name Ligorna. Livorno was used certainly in the eighteenth century by Florentines.\nBetween 1427 and 1429, a census counted 118 families in Livorno, including 423 persons. Monks, Jews, military personnel, and the homeless were not included in the census. The only remainder of medieval Livorno is a fragment of two towers and a wall, located inside the Fortezza Vecchia.\n\nMedicean period (1500–1650)\nAfter the arrival of the Medici, the ruling dynasty of Florence, some modifications were made in the city. Between 1518 and 1534 the Fortezza Vecchia was constructed, and the voluntary resettlement of the population to Livorno was stimulated. Livorno still remained a rather insignificant coastal fortress. By 1551, the population had grown to 1562 residents.\nSeat of the crusading and corsairing Order of Saint Stephen after 1561, distinctive for its aggressive approach towards the Muslim world, Livorno became a major Mediterranean slave trade hub in the early modern period, rivalling Malta's. Its share of slave population may have been over a 25% of the population.\nDuring the Italian Renaissance, when the settlement was ruled by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany of the House of Medici, Livorno was designed as an \"Ideal town\". In 1577 the architect Bernardo Buontalenti drew up the first plan. The new fortified town had a pentagonal design, for which it is called Pentagono del Buontalenti, incorporating the original settlement. The Porto Mediceo was overlooked and defended by towers and fortresses leading to the town centre.\nIn the late 1580s, Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, declared Livorno a free port (porto franco), which meant that the goods traded here were duty-free within the area of the town's control. \nIn 1593, the Duke's administration established the Leggi Livornine to regulate trade. These laws protected merchant activities from crime and racketeering, and instituted laws regarding international trade. The laws established a well-regulated market and were in force until 1603. Also expanding Christian tolerance, the laws offered the right of public freedom of religion and amnesty to people having to gain penance from clergy in order to conduct civil business. The Grand Duke attracted numerous Turks, Persians, Moors, Greeks, and Armenians, along with Jewish immigrants. Sephardic Jews began to immigrate to Livorno in the late sixteenth century, following the Alhambra Decree and expulsion of Jews from Spain and Portugal. Livorno extended rights and privileges to them, and they contributed greatly to the mercantile wealth and scholarship in the city.\nLivorno became an enlightened European city and one of the most important ports of the entire Mediterranean Basin. Many European foreigners moved to Livorno. These included Christian Protestant reformers who supported such leaders as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and others. French, Dutch, and English arrived, along with Orthodox Greeks. Meanwhile, Jews continued to trade under their previous treaties with the Grand Duke. On 19 March 1606, Ferdinando I de' Medici elevated Livorno to the rank of city; the ceremony was held in the Fortezza Vecchia Chapel of Francis of Assisi.\n\nThe Counter-Reformation increased tensions among Christians; dissidents to the Papacy were targeted by various Catholic absolute rulers. Livorno's tolerance declined during the European wars of religion. But, in the preceding period, the merchants of Livorno had developed a series of trading networks with Protestant Europe, and the Dutch, British, and Germans worked to retain these. In 1653 a naval battle, the Battle of Leghorn, was fought near Livorno during the First Anglo-Dutch War.\n\n17th century and later\nAt the end of the 17th century, Livorno underwent a period of great urban planning and expansion. Near the defensive pile of the Old Fortress, a new fortress was built, together with the town walls and the system of navigable canals through neighbourhoods. After the port of Pisa had silted up in the 13th century, its distance from the sea increased and it lost its dominance in trade. Livorno took over as the main port in Tuscany. By 1745 Livorno's population had risen to 32,534 persons.\nThe more successful of the European powers re-established trading houses in the region, especially the British with the Levant Company. In turn, the trading networks grew, and with those, Britain's cultural contact with Tuscany. An increasing number of British writers, artists, philosophers, and travellers visited the area and developed the unique historical ties between the two communities. The British referred to the city in English as \"Leghorn\", derived from the Genoese term. Through the centuries, the city's trade fortunes fell and rose according to the success or failure of the Great Powers. The British and their Protestant allies were important to its trade.\n\nDuring the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars of the late eighteenth century, Napoleon's troops occupied Livorno along with the rest of Tuscany. Under the Continental System, the French prohibited trade with Britain, and the economy of Livorno suffered greatly. The French had altogether taken over Tuscany by 1808, incorporating it into the Napoleonic empire. After the Congress of Vienna, Austrian rule replaced the French.\nIn 1861, Italy succeeded in its wars of unification. At that time the city counted 96,471 inhabitants. Livorno and Tuscany became part of the new Kingdom of Italy and, as part of the Kingdom, the town lost its status as a free port. The city's commercial importance declined.\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, Livorno had numerous public parks housing important museums such as the Museo Civico Giovanni Fattori, Museo di storia naturale del Mediterraneo, and cultural institutions as the Biblioteca Labronica F.D. Guerrazzi and others in Neoclassical style as Cisternone, Teatro Goldoni and Liberty style as Palazzo Corallo, Mercato delle Vettovaglie, Stabilimento termale Acque della Salute, the Scuole elementari Benci all the last on project by Angiolo Badaloni.\nIn the early 19th century, the American Elizabeth Ann Seton converted from Protestantism to Catholicism while visiting Italian friends in Livorno. She later was canonized as the first American-born saint.\nDuring the 1930s, numerous villas were built on the avenue along the sea in Liberty style based on designs by Cioni. These added to the architectural richness of the city.\nLivorno suffered extensive damage during World War II. Many historic sites and buildings were destroyed by bombs of the Allies preceding their invasion of Italy, including the cathedral and Synagogue of Livorno.\nSince the late 20th century, Livorno's residents have become well known for their left-wing politics. The Italian Communist Party was founded in Livorno in 1921.\n\nClimate\nLivorno has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa). Summers have warm days with the heat lingering on throughout the night, hence going above the subtropical threshold in spite of its relatively high latitude. Winters are mild for the latitude due to the moderating influence from the Mediterranean Sea. Precipitation is in a wet winter/dry summer pattern as with all climates fitting the Mediterranean definition.\n\nPopulation\nForeigner minorities\nArmenian community\nFerdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany issued in 1591 a decree encouraging Armenians to settle in Livorno to increase its trade with the Ottoman Empire and western Asia. By the beginning of the 17th century, Armenians operated 120 shops in town. In 1701 the Armenian community, who were members of the Armenian Apostolic Church, were authorized to build their own church, which they dedicated to Gregory the Illuminator. The project was by Giovanni Battista Foggini and the church was completed a few years later but did not open for worship until 1714. The church had a Latin cross plant and a dome at the intersection of the transept and nave. Destroyed during World War II, it was partly restored in 2008 but is not open to worship.\n\nGreek community\nThe first Greeks who settled in Livorno early in the 16th century were former mercenaries in the fleet of Cosimo de' Medici and their descendants. This community grew and became significant in the 18th and 19th centuries when Livorno became one of the principal hubs of the Mediterranean trade. Most of the new Greek immigrants came from western Greece, Chios, Epirus and Cappadocia.\nBased on its status since the late 16th century as a free port (port franc) and the warehouses constructed for long-term storage of goods and grains from the Levant, until the late 19th century Livorno enjoyed a strong strategic position related to Greek mercantile interests in the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, and the North Atlantic.  The conflicts between Great Britain and France during the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century, with associated port embargoes, piracy, and confiscation of cargoes, played out to the advantage of those Greek merchants willing to accept risk. By the 1820s, Greek entrepreneurs gradually replaced the Protestant British, Dutch, French and other merchants who left the city.\nThe Greeks concentrated on the grain market, banking and ship-brokering. Cargoes of wheat from the Black Sea were received at Livorno, before being re-shipped to England. Returning ships carried textiles and other industrial goods, which Greek merchants shipped to Alexandria and other destinations in the Ottoman Empire. Chians controlled much of the trade. In 1839 Livorno had ten major commercial houses, led primarily by ethnic Greeks and Jewish Italians.\nThe ethnic Greek community (nazione) had a distinctive cultural and social identity based on their common Greek Orthodox religion, language and history.  In 1775 they established the Confraternity of Holy Trinity (Confraternita della SS. Trinità) and the Church of the Santissima Trinità, Livorno, the second non-Catholic church in Tuscany. The Armenians had earlier built their own Orthodox church. The community founded a Greek school, awarding scholarships for higher studies to young Greeks from the Peloponnese, Epirus, Chios or Smyrna. The community raised funds to support the Greek War of Independence of 1821, as well as various Greek communities in the Ottoman Empire and in Italy.\nIt also assisted non-Greeks. The Rodocanachi family financed the \"School of Mutual Education\" established in Livorno by the pedagogist Enrico Mayer. The community contributed to founding a school for poor Catholic children. The local governing authorities recognized the contributions of distinguished members of the Greek community (e.g. members of the Papoudoff, Maurogordatos, Rodocanachi, Tossizza and other families) and granted them titles of nobility. After unification and the founding of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, the Greek community in Livorno declined, as the privileges of the free port were rescinded.\n\nJewish community\nSee the history of the Jews in Livorno.\n\nDialects\nVernacolo\nLivorno inhabitants speak a variant of the Italian Tuscan dialect, known as a vernacolo. Il Vernacoliere, a satirical comic-style magazine printed chiefly in the Livornese dialect, was founded in 1982 and is now nationally distributed.\n\nBagitto\nThe bagitto was a Judæo-Italian regional dialect once used by the Jewish community in Livorno. It was a language based on Italian, developed with words coming from Tuscan, Spanish, Portuguese, Hebrew and Yiddish; the presence of Portuguese and Spanish words is due to the origin of the first Jews who came to Livorno, having been expelled from the Iberian peninsula in the late 15th century.\n\nEconomy\nPort of Livorno\nThe city and its port have continued as an important destination for travelers and tourists attracted to its historic buildings and setting. The port processes thousands of cruise-ship passengers of the following cruise line:\n\nmany of whom take arranged buses to inland destinations as Florence, Pisa and Siena.\n\nCantiere navale fratelli Orlando\nSince 1866 Livorno has been noted for its Cantiere navale fratelli Orlando. Azimut-Benetti acquired the Cantiere navale fratelli Orlando, then of Fincantieri, in 2003.\n\nEni petrochemical\nThe Eni plant produces gasoline, diesel fuel, fuel oil and lubricants. Livorno refinery was established in 1936 by Azienda Nazionale Idrogenazione Combustibili (ANIC) but the plant was completely destroyed during World War II. The plant was rebuilt thanks to an agreement between the ANIC and the Standard Oil forming the STANIC. The production of the new plant raised from 700,000 to 2 million tons in 1955; nowadays the capacity of refining is 84,000 barrels per day. The refinery, now property of Eni, is linked to the Darsena petroli (Oil dock) and to Firenze depots by two pipelines.\n\nLeonardo Sistemi di Difesa\nThe former Whitehead Alenia Sistemi Subacquei (WASS) plant, based in Livorno produced heavy and light torpedoes, anti-torpedo countermeasure systems for submarines and ships and sonar systems for underwater surveillance. The factory was founded by Robert Whitehead in 1875 in Fiume, in that period Austria-Hungary, and produced for the first time torpedoes sold all around the world. In 1905 the factory changed its name to Torpedo Fabrik Whitehead & Co. Gesellschaft and before his death, Whitehead sold his shares package to Vickers Armstrong Whitworth. At the end of World War I the factory was in economic crisis and was purchased by Giuseppe Orlando, one of the owners of the Cantiere navale fratelli Orlando of Livorno, as Whitehead Torpedo, in 1924 when was signed the Treaty of Rome and Fiume passed to Italy. Whitehead Torpedo established in Livorno the Società Moto Fides that initially produced motorcycles but changed the production to that of torpedoes. With the end of World War II the Fiume factory closed and merged with Moto Fides forming the Whitehead Moto Fides Stabilimenti Meccanici Riuniti on 31 July 1945 manufacturing 1000 A244 light torpedo sold to 15 Navies. The Whiteheads Moto Fides continued the production of torpedoes in a new plant which opened in 1977 and still operating, then entered in the Fiat Group in 1979 and in 1995 passed definitely to Finmeccanica. It is now owned by Leonardo S.p.A., as the latter has been renamed since 2018.\n\nFinancial district\nAnother important role is played by the financial service, concentrated above all in via Cairoli, called the small city of Livorno, in which the headquarters of banks, financial institutions and insurance companies are concentrated, as well as the Post Office Building.\n\nTuaca\nTuaca liqueur was produced in Livorno until 2010; the famous distillery was closed and operations were brought to the United States by the new owners. Galliano is still made here and enjoyed by locals and tourists alike.\n\nGovernment\nMain sights\nAcquario comunale \"Diacinto Cestoni\"\nLivorno Aquarium, dedicated to Diacinto Cestoni, is the main in Tuscany. It is situated by Terrazza Mascagni on the seafront promenade. It was built on a project by Enrico Salvais and Luigi Pastore as a heliotherapy centre and was opened to the public on 20 June 1937. Destroyed during World War II was rebuilt in 1950; in 1999 underwent extensive reconstruction, on a plan by Studio Gregotti and works carried out by Opera Laboratori Fiorentini, was opened definitely on 31 July 2010.\nOn the ground floor, the exhibition includes: Diacinto Cestoni Room which consists of 12 exhibition tanks, Mediterranean Area, Indus-Pacific tank, Caribbean Sea, Ligurian coast, Tropical waters, Greek-Roman archaeological coastal area. Livorno Aquarium has 33 exhibition tanks containing 2000 animals of 300 different species.\n\nMuseo Civico Giovanni Fattori\nDedicated to painter Giovanni Fattori, the museum mainly featuring contemporary art from the 19th-century was inaugurated in 1994 and is placed inside Villa Mimbelli, an 18th-century construction surrounded by a vast park. The origin of the museum dates back to 1877 when the Comune of Livorno founded a Civic Gallery where to collect all the artistic objects kept in several places around the town; in the same period was written the guideline of the gallery which hosted a collection of paintings of authors by Livorno.\n\nMuseo Ebraico \"Yeshivà Marini\"\nThe Yeshivà Marini Museum is housed in a neoclassical building already place of worship as Marini Oratory since 1867; once was home of the Confraternity Malbish Arumin which was provided to help the city's poor. In the post-war period was utilized as a synagogue in the waiting for the construction of the new one. The museum has a collection of liturgical objects coming from the old Synagogue destroyed in World War II. The commerce practised by the Jews community increased the property of the synagogue allowing a varied religious heritage of Dutch, Florentine, Venetian, Roman and Northern African origin. The display regard the Torah ark, the sefer Torah, paintings, religious objects as the Oriental-style wooden hekhal; the oldest and most important pieces went lost.\n\nMuseo di storia naturale del Mediterraneo\nThe origins of the museum date back to 1929 and part of the objects went destroyed by World War II. After the war, the museum was reopened inside the Livorno Aquarium and only in 1980 was transferred to Villa Henderson. The museum is divided in several halls regarding the Man, the Man in the Mediterranean context, the Invertebrates, the Sea, the Flight in Nature. Inside the museum is a Planetarium and an Auditorium.\n\nMuseo Mascagnano\nThe Museo Mascagnano houses memorabilia, documents and operas by the great composer Pietro Mascagni, who lived here. Every year some of his operas are traditionally played during the lyric music season, which is organized by the Goldoni Theatre. Also the Terrazza Mascagni is situated on the boulevard on the seafront, is named in his honour.\n\nOrto Botanico del Mediterraneo\nThe Orto Botanico del Mediterraneo is a botanical garden located on the grounds of the Museo di storia naturale del Mediterraneo.\n\nPoints of interest\nCivil architecture\nVenezia Nuova\nFerdinando II de' Medici considered, in 1629, the opportunity to enlarge the town, on project by Giovanni Battista Santi, toward north in an area included among Fortezza Vecchia and Fortezza Nuova, in order to give an adequate space to the maritime and commercial activities. There was the need to build a mercantile district, close to Porto Mediceo, provided with houses and depots to store the merchandise and a system of canals to facilitate their transport. The new rione (district), called Venezia Nuova, was built in an area gained to the sea, intersected by canals and linked to the town with bridges, for this reason, Venetians skilled workers were recruited.\nThe Chiesa di Sant'Anna, dedicated to Saint Anne, was built in 1631 on the ground of the Arch confraternity of the Company of the Nativity; in the same year Giovanni Battista Santi died and the control of the project passed to Giovanni Francesco Cantagallina though the works slowed down due to the lack of funds.\nA new impulse to the works was given in 1656 concerning the distribution of the spaces where to build other houses and stores; consequently arose the problem of the diverse oriented road scheme with respect to the axis of Piazza d’Arme, it was resolved by adopting a road plan perpendicular to the Navicelli channel. The paving of the roads and along the canals in Venezia Nuova was provided in 1668, while the Pescheria Nuova (New fish market) was built in 1705 close to the Scali del Pesce where the fish was unloaded.\nIn the 1700s Venezia Nuova was the district of the Consuls of the Nations and of the most important international retailers who had the warehouses filled with goods from everywhere waiting to be shipped by sea to the most different destinations. The palaces along the canals had the turrets from which to see the ships approaching the port, moreover, they had the stores at the canal level to facilitate the unloading of the goods from the boats.\nThe Venezia Nuova district retains much of its original town planning and architectural features such as the bridges, narrow lanes, the houses of the nobility, churches as Santa Caterina da Siena and San Ferdinando, and a dense network of canals that once served to link its warehouses to the port.\n\nMonumento dei quattro mori\nThe Monument of the Four Moors is dedicated to Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and is one of the most popular monuments of Livorno. Ferdinando I commissioned it to Giovanni Bandini in 1595 to carry out a monument in white Carrara marble to represent him in the uniform of the Grand master of the Order of Saint Stephen which in that period prevailed in several naval battles against the Barbary pirates. The monument was completed in 1599, shortly before the death of Bandini which occurred on 18 April,\nand arrived to Livorno by sea from Carrara in 1601.\nFerdinando I projected to add four statues of moors prisoners at the pedestal of his monument and gave the task to Pietro Tacca in 1602 but the monument remained in a corner of the square till 29 May 1617 when it was inaugurated by Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. In the meantime Tacca received the approval to add the four moors to the pedestal; the first two statues were fused in Florence in 1622 and carried on the barges along the Arno to Livorno; according to the tradition the young moor was named Morgiano and the older Alì Salentino; the other two sculptures were installed in 1626. During the French occupation of Livorno, from 1796 to 1799, the monument was removed from Sextius Mollis commander of the French garrison because it represented an insult to the tyranny, as soon as the French left the town the monument was put back in its former place.\nDuring World War II the monument was transferred to a protected place in order to avoid being damaged by allied attacks, the statue of Ferdinando I was hidden in the Pisa Charterhouse and the four moors in the Medici Villa at Poggio a Caiano.\nThe monument has been restored recently in 1990 and 2013.\n\nAcquedotto Leopoldino\nThe Acquedotto Leopoldino and the neoclassical cisterns of Livorno were part of a sophisticated scheme to provide water to Livorno.\n\nLa Gran Conserva\nLa Gran Conserva, or Il Cisternone, situated on what were the outskirts of 19th-century Livorno, is the largest and best known of the city's covered cisterns.\n\nCisternino di città\nCisternino di città is an austere neoclassical design which was approved in 1837 and completed in 1848.\n\nPiazza della Repubblica\nAt the beginning of the 19th century arose the need to connect the Medicean road system of the Pentagono del Buontalenti to the new eastern districts of the town, on the other side of the Fosso Reale, and the requirement to dismantle the city gate Porta a Pisa. The solution adopted in 1844 was that of Luigi Bettarini which considered the coverage of the Fosso Reale with an imposing vault, 240 meters long and 90 meters wide, creating an elliptical paving. The portion of the canal covered by the new structure continued to be navigable.\nThe new square was commonly called Piazza del Voltone until 1850, then Piazza dei Granduchi in honour of the Lorraine dynasty until 1859, in the period of the Italian unification was named to Carlo Alberto until June 1946 when was given the current name Piazza della Repubblica. The square, adorned with 52 marble benches, 92 pillars and two statues dedicated to Ferdinand III by Francesco Pozzi were inaugurated on 8 September 1847 and that dedicated to Leopold II by Paolo Emilio Demi was installed on 6 June 1848. The statue of Leopoldo II was damaged by the crowd on 6 May 1849 and removed from the square because the Emperor was seen as the symbol of the Austrian domination; the statue was placed in Piazza XX Settembre in 1957.\n\nTerrazza Mascagni\nThe Terrazza Mascagni is a wide sinuous belvedere toward the sea with views to the Livorno hills, the Tuscan Archipelago to Corsica, and the Port of Livorno. It is located on the site of the Forte dei Cavalleggieri (Cavalrymen Fort) built in the 17th century by Cosimo I de' Medici to deter pirate raids, subsequently replaced by a leisure park in the 1800s, and a heliotherapy centre in the early 1900s. A new parterre, built between 1925 and 1928 by Enrico Salvais and Luigi Pastore, was formed by a series of flower beds and a walkway which follow the outline of the sea with numerous balustrades named after Costanzo Ciano. The Terrazza has a paved surface of 8,700 square meters formed by 34,800 black and white tiles placed as a checkerboard and 4,100 balusters. In 1932, a gazebo for musical performances was built in the large square; it was destroyed during World War II. In 1937 the Livorno Aquarium was constructed. After the war, the Terrazza was dedicated to Pietro Mascagni and in 1994 it underwent a complete restoration using the same kind of materials originally employed; the works were completed on 10 July 1998 with the reconstruction of the gazebo.\n\nPalazzo Comunale\nLivorno was elevated to the status of city on 19 March 1606 by Ferdinando I de' Medici, the first Gonfaloniere Bernardetto Borromei and the Community representatives held their meetings in the Church of Saint Mary and Saint Julia. On 13 June 1646 a building, placed in Via del Porticciolo, was purchased for the sum of seven thousand ducats, in order to accommodate the Community. It was evident that it was inadequate to the task and the Council deliberated, on 27 January 1720, the construction of the new town hall on the project by Giovanni del Fantasia.\nThe new neo-renaissance palace, positioned between Palazzo della Dogana and Palazzo Granducale on the north side of Piazza d’Arme, was partially destroyed by the 1742 earthquake. Restored in 1745 by Bernardino Ciurini and Antonio Fabbri a double white marble stairway and a small bell tower on the top of the façade were added. In 1867 the complex was enlarged with the acquisition of three other buildings in the back. With the settlement of the Podestà in the fascist period was carried out a new enlargement in 1929 by Enrico Salvais and Luigi Pastore transforming the adjacent former fire station in the council hall. Damaged by the bombing during World War II it was rebuilt and renovated under the direction of Primavera and was inaugurated in 1949 by the mayor Furio Diaz.\n\nReligious architecture\nCathedral of Saint Francis of Assisi\nThe cathedral of the town, commonly called Duomo di Livorno, is dedicated to Francis of Assisi, Mary, mother of Jesus, and Julia of Corsica, and was built in a central position of the Pentagono del Buontalenti on the south side of Piazza Grande once named Piazza d’Arme. The original plan was drawn up by Bernardo Buontalenti when he projected the new town. The construction began in June 1581 on a reviewed plan by Alessandro Pieroni under the direction of Antonio Cantagallina. The church had a rectangular plant with a single nave, the original wooden ceiling, executed from 1610 to 1614, was carved by Vincenzo Ricordati and gilded with seven inserted paintings. Jacopo Ligozzi, Domenico Cresti and Jacopo Chimenti decorated, from 1610 to 1614, three large paintings representing \"St Francis with Child and the Virgin\", the \"Assumption of Mary\" and the \"Apotheosis of Ste Julia\", the other four paintings were works by minor artists. The simply façade had a marble porch with twin Doric columns surmounted by a terrace added in 1605 on a project by Alessandro Pieroni.\n\nThe church was consecrated on 19 February 1606 by Monsignor Nunzio Antonio Grimani; on request by Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in 1629, was elevated to collegiate church and the Curato was substituted from a Proposto having the functions of the Vicar of the archbishop of Pisa.\nThe plant of the church was modified in Christian cross when in 1716 was added the first of two lateral chapels. The left side chapel, dedicated to the Eucharist, was built on a project by Giovanni del Fantasia with frescoes by Giovanni Maria Terreni and the altar attributed to Giovanni Baratta, The right side chapel, dedicated to Immaculate Conception, was built in 1727 and was decorated with paintings by Luigi Ademollo. The Collegiata in 1806 was elevated to cathedral and in 1817 was added the bell tower 50 meters high on project by Gaspero Pampaloni.\nThe cathedral was completely destroyed in 1943 from the Allied bombardment during World War II; it was then rebuilt respecting the original structure except for the two marble porches added to the transepts and was consecrated on 21 December 1952 by Bishop Giovanni Piccioni.\nSince 2006, on the occasion of the bicentennial of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Livorno, the \"Christ Crowned with Thorns\", by Fra Angelico, was displayed in the Chapel of the Eucharist.\n\nChurch of the Madonna\nThe Church of the Madonna is placed on the street of the same name which connects directly the city centre with the district Venezia Nuova through the John of Nepomuk bridge. According to tradition the church was built to host the statute of Our Lady of Mount Carmel subtracted from a Turkish ship. The church was important as it was a place of worship for foreign communities. Ferdinando I de' Medici gave the church to the Franciscan which had the nearby Oratory of Saints Cosmas and Damian. The construction began on 25 March 1607 on a project by Alessandro Pieroni and was completed in 1611; the church at first was dedicated to Saint Mary, Saint Francis and Saints Cosmas and Damian but in 1638 was dedicated to the Immaculate Conception following enlargement of the building.\nThe church has a rectangular plan with a single nave and groin vault, on each side, there are the three altars of the foreign Nations. The altar of the French Nation was built in 1613 and the painting, by Matteo Rosselli, represents Saint Louis. The altar of the Corsican Nation, which at the time was under the control of the Republic of Genoa, has a painting representing John the Evangelist. The altar of the Portuguese Nation, built in the 17th century, had a wooden statue of Saint Mary until 1728 when this was positioned near the main altar and replaced by one of Anthony of Padua.

The church was built in 1601 on a project by Alessandro Pieroni, was completed in 1605 and consecrated on 25 March 1606. The baroque façade was built in 1708 presumably on a project by Giovanni Baratta with a triangular pediment and Doric order and was decorated by the statues of Meekness and Innocence by Andrea Vaccà.

In 1392 this fort was connected to a wall in order to defend better the town and the Darsena. Livorno, in 1405, was sold to Genoa which reinforced the defences, building three forts under the Quartered, afterwards Livorno was bought from Florence on 28 August 1421 at the price of 100.000 Tuscan florin.\nThe project to build Fortezza Vecchia was commissioned to Antonio da Sangallo the Elder in 1506, the fortress had to incorporate the existing Pisan and Genovese constructions.\n\nThe works started in 1518 on the order of Cardinal Giulio De' Medici under the supervision of Nicolao da Pietrasanta. The construction was suspended since the popular revolt forced the Medici in exile and was resumed in 1530 on their return. Fortezza Vecchia is a massive fortification completed on 1 April 1534 under Alessandro de' Medici; it was built in red-brick with sloping walls and the interposition of clear stones, it has a quadrangular plant with a perimeter of 1500 meters and was equipped with 24 cannons to protect each side. One of the corners directs inside to join the Quartered of the Pisans and Matilda and Genoa keep; the three others are protected by triangular bastions with rounded tips. The bastion towards the north is called Capitana because there moored the main Galley, to the east is Ampolletta since housed the sand-glass used to control the guard duty, to the west is the Canaviglia derived from Cavaniglia the name of the commander of the galleys of the Grand Ducky of Tuscany. The land on the side toward the town was excavated in order to have the fortress surrounded by the sea for better defence. Cosimo I de' Medici built in 1544 an imposing palace, overlooking the Vecchia Darsena, above the Quartered of the Pisans which went destroyed during World War II. The successor Francesco I de' Medici built a small palace toward the sea, later became Porto Mediceo, on the top of Canaviglia bastion situated at the entrance of Vecchia Darsena. On the opposite side was built a church dedicated to Saint Francis where on 19 March 1606 Ferdinando I de' Medici elevated Livorno to the status of city. Fortezza Vecchia changed its function to the coming of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine in 1737, by a defensive structure to a military college for officers of the Army of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (1769) and afterwards in garrison (1795).\n\nFortezza Nuova\nThe origin of Fortezza Nuova (New fortress) take place at the end of the 1500s, by the adjustment of Baluardo San Francesco (Saint Francis rampart) and Baluardo Santa Barbara (Saint Barbara rampant) of the project commissioned by Cosimo I to Bernardo Buontalenti with the intention to develop a new urban plan of the town that led to a pentagonal shape surrounded by canals.\nThe original project was then modified by Don Giovanni de' Medici, Claudio Cogorano and Alessandro Pieroni to allow the construction of Fortezza Nuova in order to strengthen the military apparatus of the town. The works started on 10 January 1590 and ended in 1604, the result is a considerable fortification, in stones and red bricks, with a polygonal plant surrounded by water; the new modification brought to the construction of Forte San Pietro (Saint Peter fort) to defend the Venezia Nuova quarter.\n\nIn 1629 part of the fortress was demolished to permit the building of Venezia Nuova and San Marco quarters wanted by Ferdinando II. \n \nFortezza Nuova has been used for military purpose until the end of World War II, inside were built barracks and warehouses and a chapel dedicated to Immaculate Conception.\nThe fortress was heavily damaged during World War II with the destruction of most parts of the buildings, the restoration was completed in 1972 and the superior part is used at present as a public park and centre for events and displays.\n\nPentagono del Buontalenti\nFrancesco I de' Medici gave to Bernardo Buontalenti in 1575 the task to project the ideal town in order to transform Livorno from a fishing village in a fortified town to accommodate 12,000 inhabitants, to include the original settlement and the Fortezza Vecchia, capable to become the trade centre of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The development of the project led to a pentagonal plant as in use in the Renaissance period, each side 600 meters long, with defensive walls, rampant and five bastions at the vertices, surrounded by canals; the fifth bastion coincided with Fortezza Vecchia. The plan gave no information regarding the function of the new urban area, indicating only a series of building blocks within a road system absolutely orthogonal, cardo and Decumanus Maximus.\nThe road axis from north to south (cardo) underline the direction that united the centre of the town with a significant place as the Sanctuary of Montenero; the axis from west to east (decumanus) linked the Baluardo Santa Giulia to Baluardo Sant’Andrea.\nIn August 1576 was created the Office of the Fabbrica di Livorno with the task of supervising the construction and Alessandro Puccini was the chief superintendent.\nFrancesco I de' Medici laid the first stone for the construction of the Baluardo di San Francesco (Saint Francis rampant) of the new town on 28 March 1577; the works went on with several changes compared with the original plan including the construction of the Fortezza Nuova.\nLivorno became a town, encircled by the navigable Fosso Reale (Royal canal), with numerous palaces, warehouse, garrisons and custom-houses. The central street at that time was Via Ferdinanda extended for 750 meters, later called Via Grande, from Porta Colonnella (Colonella city gate), in the proximity of Vecchia Darsena, to Porta Pisana (Pisan city gate). The Baluardo Sant’Andrea was initiated in 1578 while the Baluardo Santa Giulia started in 1582.\nIn 1594 it was decided to create a huge square, at halfway of Via Ferdinanda, where to build the church of the new town. The church, which was built in a central position on the south side of Piazza d’Arme, later Piazza Grande, was completed in 1602 under the direction of Antonio Cantagaliina and Alessandro Pieroni. Piazza d’Arme was completed and enlarged with the old Porticciolo dei Genovesi (Port of Genovesi) filled up with earth to make room to the building called Tre Palazzi (Three palaces); the square was adorned with a series of marble arcades attributed to Alessandro Pieroni. \n The Palazzo del Picchetto was built, on plan by Giovanni Battista Foggini and Giovanni del Fantasia in 1707, at the end of Via Ferdinanda in the proximity of Porta Pisana.\n\nAccademia Navale\nThe Italian Naval Academy is a mixed-sex military university in Livorno, which is responsible for the technical training of military officers of the Italian Navy.\n\nMain sight\nSport\nU.S. Livorno 1915, a semi-professional football club, currently plays in the Serie D.

Cook's real-life sons, Mekhai and Phoenix Andersen.\n\nPenelope Garcia\nPlayed by Kirsten Vangsness, Penelope García is the team's technical analyst at BAU headquarters in Quantico, Virginia. She is flamboyant, a nonconformist, kind, and fun-loving and provides the rest of the team with comic and compassionate relief whenever it is needed. Penelope’s mother remarried into the Garcia family. She has a brother named Carlos. Her parents were both killed by a drunk driver. Although she is an American of English descent, she celebrates presumably Mexican/Mexican-American traditions from her stepfather’s side. She and SSA Morgan share a very friendly-flirty relationship that never goes beyond that, although Penelope does show mild jealousy when she sees him dancing with two other women. In turn, Morgan, responds negatively when asked for proposal advice by her then boyfriend, fellow FBI computer tech Kevin Lynch. Penelope taught herself to hack after she dropped out of college and was aligned with the best underground hackers in the world. After being caught by the FBI, she was given a choice of living in a high-security prison for the rest of her life or working for the BAU division of the FBI as an analyst. Two episodes focus on García's character. In \"Penelope\", she was shot and almost killed. Garcia temporarily takes up responsibilities, following JJ's departure, as a media liaison, completely changing her looks. She quickly realizes the job is not for her and resumes her job as a technical analyst. The liaison position is then split between her and Hotch, a job she retains when JJ returns to the BAU as a profiler. In \"The Black Queen\", Penelope's past is brought up after a series of flashbacks. In those flashbacks, viewers see a Goth-looking Garcia. Her background and history are revealed, indicating that her extraordinary computer skills are self-taught. She is overcome by guilt by her past actions, so much so that when her hacker ex-boyfriend needs to be caught, she volunteers to be bait. She is really uncomfortable in this situation and says that she would never do it again. Garcia states that she didn't know why she was ever \"that\" person.\n\nEmily Prentiss\nPlayed by Paget Brewster, SSA Emily Prentiss is the daughter of an ambassador and a U.S. diplomat. After Agent Elle Greenaway leaves the BAU permanently following a case in which she had shot an unsub in cold blood, Prentiss shows up with papers stating she is the newest member of the BAU, which catches both Hotch and Gideon off guard since they hadn't signed off on her transfer. She became a permanent member of the team in \"Lessons Learned\" where it was revealed that she was fluent in Arabic. She also has a tough relationship with her mother. She got pregnant at the age of 15 and later chose to have an abortion. Prentiss is also skilled at chess.\nIn \"The Thirteenth Step\" (episode 6.13), Prentiss receives some disturbing news from her previous boss at Interpol. In the following episode, \"Sense Memory\", after coming home from work, she notices that someone had been in her house because her cat's back was wet and her window was open. She also received several strange phone calls, with the caller ID saying \"Caller Unknown\". This also leaves Agent Morgan concerned for Prentiss. Prentiss appears in only 18 episodes of season 6. She faked her death to escape an old nemesis with the help of both Hotch and JJ while the rest of the team continued to assume she was dead. In season seven premiere (\"It Takes a Village\"), Emily returns to the team when Doyle resurfaces and she rejoins by the end of the episode. At the end of the season, she leaves the team to return and run Interpol in London.\nShe returns for the 200th episode to help rescue a kidnapped SSA Jennifer Jareau and again in the episode \"Tribute\" (season 11), where she enlists the help of the BAU in catching a serial killer who had originally killed in Europe before killing in the United States. Paget Brewster was confirmed to return for a several episode arc in Season 12. Following the dismissal of Thomas Gibson, Brewster was promoted to a series regular again starting from Season 12, episode 3; later Prentiss is promoted to Hotch's position of unit chief.\n\nDavid Rossi\nPlayed by Joe Mantegna, Senior Supervisory Special Agent David Rossi, a \"'founding father' of the BAU\", was in early retirement from 1997 until his voluntary return to the BAU in 2007, replacing Jason Gideon, who had abruptly resigned from the BAU. He had retired in order to write books and go on lecture tours, but he returned to settle some unfinished business that was not immediately specified. It was later revealed that the case involved three young children whose parents had been murdered in a possible home-invasion case that had remained unsolved. This case haunted Rossi for twenty years and prompted him to return to the BAU, where he eventually solved it. He served in the Vietnam war and lost a close friend which was revealed in a series of flashbacks.\n\nDr. Tara Lewis\nPlayed by Aisha Tyler, Lewis is Callahan's and JJ's temporary replacement while they are both on maternity leave. Dr. Tara Lewis is a psychologist with an eye on forensic psychology and its application toward the criminal justice system. Her dream was to study psychopaths up close and personal – and her psychology background, combined with her experience in the FBI, brought her face-to-face with monsters. Her job was to stare them down and interview them, in order to determine if they were fit to stand trial. In the process, she made herself find the humanity inside these broken men (and, sometimes, women) in order to learn if there was a conscience behind their brutal crimes. Lewis is also fluent in both French and German.\n\nLuke Alvez\nPlayed by former CSI: Miami star Adam Rodríguez, Fugitive Task Force Agent and Supervisory Special Agent. Alvez is a member of the FBI Fugitive Task Force that partners with the BAU to catch the escaped serial killers that escaped in the Season 11 finale. In the Season 12 premiere he works with the BAU to catch the \"Crimson King\", one of the escapees that attacked Alvez's old partner. The team discovers the real killer is \"Mr. Scratch\" who taunts the team by turning over the real \"Crimson King\", who was tortured to the point he no longer remembered who he was. After that Alvez decides to join the BAU full-time and was Hotch's last hire. Alvez has a dog named Roxy (whom Garcia thought at first was his human girlfriend) and served in Iraq as an Army Ranger prior to joining the FBI.\n\nFormer\nDr. Spencer Reid\nPlayed by Matthew Gray Gubler, SSA Dr. Spencer Reid is a genius who graduated from Las Vegas High School at age 12. Reid's mother, Diana Reid, has schizophrenia and was sent to a mental hospital by Spencer himself when he turned 18. He is almost always introduced as Dr. Reid, even though the others are introduced as agents because SSA Jason Gideon understood that people would not otherwise take Spencer seriously because of his young age. After an introduction, he never shakes hands. It has been revealed that he holds Ph.D.s in Mathematics, Chemistry, and Engineering, B.A.s in Psychology and Sociology, and is working on a B.A. in Philosophy. Spencer is known for having an IQ of 187 and has an eidetic memory. Around the office, Reid often interrupts others' sentences with facts. E408 Matthew Gray Gubler confirmed that Reid is Autistic. In many episodes, Dr. Reid can be seen visiting his mother in her Las Vegas Mental Help/Nursing Home. In Season 4, \"Memoriam\", Reid experiences dreams, possibly nightmares, of a young boy being murdered. This was due to a series of events that happened in Reid's childhood. In the end, Reid saw his father after a 20-year absence and found out that the murders in his dreams were indeed based on a real murder case and that his baseball coach, his mother, and his father were involved in the case, some criminally (his baseball coach), and some not criminally (his parents). Matthew Gray Gubler has been known for his many hairstyles throughout the continuing show. In almost every season his hair is different, whether he’s in his Jesus Reid era or joined a boy band.. Reid has also said that he was bullied when he was younger. Through the seasons Reid has faced many near-death experiences and even had to be resuscitated while being held captive, tortured, and drugged by Tobias Hankel (unsub from season 2 episode 15). Reid had made some attempts in finding love but only to have his girlfriend killed in front of him by her stalker and later on to be terrorized by Cat Adams top hit-woman who framed Spencer for murder sending him to prison.\n\nJason Gideon\nPlayed by Mandy Patinkin, Senior Supervisory Special Agent Jason Gideon was the BAU's best profiler. He helped Derek Morgan and Spencer Reid through their nightmares. He was shown to have a very close relationship with Reid, having hand-picked him from the FBI Academy for his team, helping Reid through many difficulties (including his implied drug use), and even leaving the good-bye letter for Reid to find. Gideon did not know Garcia well, as expressed through an episode wherein he is placed with her while he is on crutches; after they are placed, Penelope Garcia complains about him, and he doesn't know her name. Through the first two seasons, Gideon was portrayed to be very good at chess, winning against Reid many times (only exception being Reid's birthdayE104) and encouraging him to \"think outside the box\". Prior to the series, he was said to have had a \"nervous breakdown\" (or \"major depressive episode\") after he sent six men into a warehouse with a bomb in it; all six agents were killed, and he was heavily criticized about the event. He showed particular dislike for the practice of using religion as a defense or motivation for one's crimes. Gideon participated in some field operations during his time with the BAU and had the rest of his team \"think outside the box\" as well, as he made a major advance by shouting at the top of his lungs with pleas of mercy and, when questioned by his team, he said that the victims were being threatened to be kept quiet as neighbors would have heard the pleas if they were unrestrained. He blamed himself for the torture Reid received from Tobias Hankel as he had ordered Garcia to add a virus warning to the videos Hankel posted.E215 Gideon also had a son named Stephen.E111 The nature of their relationship has not been directly stated, but it was implied that they have not seen each other very recently. Gideon began to lose confidence in his profiling skills after Frank Breitkopf murdered his girlfriend, Sarah Jacobs. During his final case in Arizona, he further lost faith in his abilities when his decision to release the unsub resulted in the deaths of both the unsub and a young woman. As a result of his actions, Aaron Hotchner was suspended, which was the final straw for Gideon. He then left his cabin shortly afterwards, leaving his gun and badge behind along with a letter for Reid to find as he sought to regain a belief in happy endings.\nIn the season ten episode \"Nelson's Sparrow\", Gideon was murdered off-screen, having been shot dead at a close range by a serial killer named Donnie Mallick (Arye Gross), which prompts the BAU team to investigate Gideon's murder. During the flashbacks focusing on a young version of him for the episode which show him working at the BAU in 1978, he is played by Ben Savage.\n\nElle Greenaway\nPlayed by Lola Glaudini, SSA Elle Greenaway was formerly assigned to FBI Field Office in Seattle, Washington, and was assigned to the BAU, being an expert in sexual offense crimes. Her father was a police officer but was killed in the line of duty. She is half Cuban and speaks Spanish. She is shot by an unsub.E122 Though she physically recovers, the event leaves her with psychological scars.E201\nAs a result of those scars, Elle begins acting even more harshly in season two, especially during a case involving a serial rapist.E205 Ultimately, she kills the suspect before he could even be properly arrested.E205 During this episode, she mentions that the unsub wrote on the wall with her blood from the wound.E205 She hands in her badge and gun in the episode \"The Boogeyman\", saying that it is not an admission of guilt.\n\nAshley Seaver\nPlayed by Rachel Nichols, Ashley Seaver is an FBI cadet assigned to the BAU. Her father, Charles Beauchamp, was a horrific serial killer from North Dakota known as \"the Redmond Ripper\" who killed 25 women over the course of 10 years before Ashley was a teenager. He was caught by David Rossi and Aaron Hotchner. Because North Dakota does not have capital punishment, he was sentenced to life in prison. She has not been to see him. Though he writes to her sometimes, she never reads his letters, though she does keep them and admittedly still finds herself unable to hate him for what he did. In the episode \"What Happens at Home\", the BAU investigate a series of murders in a gated community and bring Ashley along because of her understanding of the family dynamics of a serial killer. In the end, the suspect commits suicide by cop in front of her. In the next episode, she requests that the rest of her remedial training be done with the BAU and is attached to the team. In the season seven premiere \"It Takes a Village\", it was revealed that Ashley transferred to the Domestic Trafficking Task Force, which is led by Andi Swann.\n\nDr. Alex Blake\nPlayed by Jeanne Tripplehorn, FBI Linguistics expert Dr. Alex Blake replaces SSA Emily Prentiss. She is introduced in season eight. Her appointment at the BAU was met with some mixed reactions as the team was close to Prentiss. She retired in 2001 until she rejoined the BAU in 2012 to restore her reputation after Blake was blamed for arresting the wrong suspect in the Amerithrax case and Section Chief Erin Strauss let her take the fall. As a result, she and Strauss do not get along, with Strauss accusing her of joining for selfish reasons, but they eventually make amends. The rest of the team recognize her expertise and are generally less antagonistic towards her. As season eight progressed, Blake found herself in danger when she was threatened by a serial killer, 'The Replicator', who turned out to be John Curtis: a fellow former FBI agent disgraced due to the events of the Amerithrax case, who targeted Blake out of envy that she had restored her reputation while his own was still in ruins. Curtis killed Strauss, kidnapped Blake, and tried to blow up the entire BAU team, but the team rescued her, and Rossi locked Curtis in the house to die when the bomb exploded as vengeance for Strauss's death.\nBlake graduated from Berkeley with a double major and also holds a PhD. She was recruited to the FBI at the age of 24, making her one of at least two team members to join the Bureau in their early 20s along with Spencer Reid. Blake is also a professor of forensic linguistics at Georgetown, where Reid had previously guest lectured, and an SSA in the Washington field office. During her initial time at the FBI, Blake was involved in some high-profile cases, particularly the Unabomber case.E801 Blake understands and speaks American Sign Language.E801\nIn the season nine episode \"Bully\", it is revealed that Blake is estranged from her father Damon (a retired police captain of the Kansas City Police Department) and younger brother Scott (a current homicide detective there himself); after the death of her older brother Danny (a cop killed in the line of duty) and her mother, she found it too painful to be near her father and brother, and distanced herself from them. However, after Scott is injured by the UnSub, the two siblings start to reconnect, and by the end of the episode, she reconciles with both Scott and Damon when she and the rest of the BAU team have a barbecue at her father's home.\nIn the season nine two-part finale, Blake becomes distraught and depressed when Reid is shot in the neck by the UnSub after pushing Blake out of the way and nearly dies, even commenting that it should have been her who was shot instead. She is also further upset when rescuing a young boy who was being used by the UnSub as leverage against his mother. Though Reid survives, Alex is greatly shaken by the case, and reveals to Reid that both he and the young boy reminded her of her deceased son Ethan, who died of an unnamed neurological disease at age nine. Her guilt and distress over Reid's brush with death touched a major nerve with her, seemingly pushing her to the breaking point. At the end of the \"Demons\", she sits apart from the rest of the group on the plane ride home, and it is implied that she sends a text message to Hotch handing in her resignation. After taking Reid home, telling him about Ethan, and departing, Reid finds her FBI badge in his bag, and watches her leave, saddened but accepting, from his window.\n\nKate Callahan\nPlayed by former Ghost Whisperer star Jennifer Love Hewitt, Kate Callahan has been in the FBI for eight years and has experience as an undercover agent, which has allowed her to establish a prior friendship with members of the BAU. Her sister and brother-in-law were killed in the September 11 attacks, leaving Kate as the legal guardian of their infant daughter, Meg, whom she raised for thirteen years along with her husband, Chris. This tragedy shaped her patriotic attitude. She is described as \"smart, charming, and wise for her years\" and holds a passion for making the world safer, according to showrunner Erica Messer. In the episode \"Breath Play\", Kate reveals she is pregnant. In the season ten finale, \"The Hunt\", Meg is abducted by human traffickers who are connected to a previous case that Kate had researched. Though Meg is eventually brought back safe, Kate decides to take a year off to spend with Meg, Chris, and her soon-to-be-born child.\n\nDerek Morgan\nPlayed by former The Young and the Restless star Shemar Moore, SSA Derek Morgan is a confident and assertive everyman character, the son of an African-American father and white mother. He went to Northwestern University on a football scholarship, holds a black belt in judo, runs FBI self-defense classes, and served in a bomb squad unit and as a Chicago police officer. In season two it was explained that after the death of his father when he was ten, Derek struggled somewhat: youthful fighting earned him a juvenile offender record. He was taken under the wing of a local youth center coordinator, Carl Buford (Julius Tennon), who acted as a surrogate father to Derek and helped him to obtain a college football scholarship. But he also sexually abused him; the episode \"Profiler, Profiled\" revealed this. In season three, it is revealed that he hates religion because, as he says, something bad happened to him when he was 13. He went to church every day and prayed for it to stop, but it did not. Because of this, he had resentment toward God and the church. He prays for the first time in 20 years at exactly the time, he later finds out, that Penelope Garcia is being operated on after being shot. Former Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner promotes him to unit chief in his place, a promotion Derek saw as only temporary until the \"Boston Reaper\" was captured. Aaron again takes his place as unit chief when he returns after grieving over his ex-wife's murder. He resigns to care for his family.\n\nAaron Hotchner\nPlayed by Thomas Gibson, Unit Chief SSA Aaron \"Hotch\" Hotchner used to be a prosecutor and was formerly assigned to the FBI field office in Seattle. After stepping down for a period, he returned to lead the unit. He has a son named Jack (Cade Owens) by his deceased wife Haley (Meredith Monroe). The two eventually divorced and remained on good terms until Haley was murdered by George Foyet (C. Thomas Howell), aka The Reaper, a serial killer from Boston who is one of the BAU’s most famed unsubs. Aaron's attempts to balance his family life and his job have been something of an ongoing struggle on the show. When Jennifer Jareau leaves the BAU for a promotion to a position at the Pentagon, Garcia and Hotch take up her responsibilities as media liaison, and Garcia retains this position when JJ returns to the BAU as a profiler. But in the episodes \"Closing Time\", \"A Family Affair\", and \"Run\", it is shown that he has moved on and is currently in a romantic relationship with Beth Clemmons (Bellamy Young). It is known that \"Hotch\" is rarely seen smiling throughout the show, except for when he is with his family. Hotchner left the BAU to go into the federal witness protection program with Jack after finding out that serial killer Peter Lewis (Bodhi Elfman) was stalking the boy. The character was written out of the series after Gibson was fired for getting into a physical altercation with one of the show's writers.\n\nStephen Walker\nPlayed by actor and conductor Damon Gupton, Walker is a Supervisory Special Agent with the BAU. Walker was a member of the Behavioral Analysis Program. He was contacted by Emily Prentiss about joining the BAU to assist in the manhunt for Peter Lewis, a.k.a. \"Mr. Scratch\". Walker is an experienced profiler, with about twenty years under his belt, and a member of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Program before his transfer to the BAU. He is married to a woman named Monica and has two children with her, Maya and Eli. He met Emily Prentiss, then the chief of Interpol's London office, during his line of work. He was also mentored by David Rossi. Stephen's first case concerned a terrorist cell in Belgium, and three agents were sent undercover to infiltrate it. However, Stephen's profile was wrong, and this resulted in the deaths of the undercover agents. He eventually moved on from the trauma and improved as he went along in his career. He and other BAP agents, including his longtime friend Sam Bower, were sent undercover to investigate corruption in the Russian government. Walker's skills include being fluent in Russian and playing the trombone. In \"Wheels Up\", Walker dies from injuries during a car accident with a semi-truck by Peter Lewis a.k.a. Mr. Scratch.\n\nMatt Simmons\nPlayed by Daniel Henney, SSA Matthew \"Matt\" Simmons is a Special Operations agent and special agent with the IRT. Simmons is married to his wife Kristy (Kelly Frye) and has a total of four young children, including sons Jake and David and twin daughters Lily and Chloe. Like Garrett, Simmons' full and fulfilling family life was a deliberate choice. Through his job, Simmons has some prior history with Derek Morgan and JJ of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit. He was a former member of a Special Ops unit, and his experience with the unit allowed him to hone his profiling skills.\n\nRecurring\nRecurrent\nAgent Grant Anderson\nPlayed by Brian Appel, Agent Anderson appears in \"Plain Sight\" (episode 1.4)\", The Fisher King\" (1.22 and 2.1), \"The Big Game\" (2.14), as well as \"Honor Among Thieves\" (2.20), \"The Crossing\" (3.18), \"100\" (5.9), \"The Slave of Duty\" (5.10), \"Hope\" (7.8), \"Hit\" (7.23), \"Run\" (7.24), \"Carbon Copy\" (8.16), \"The Replicator\" (8.24), \"To Bear Witness\" (9.4), and \"200\" (9.14).

She was soon shot by The Fisher King, as he had already been there, waiting for her. Hotch scolds Anderson briefly for not doing more, and quickly sends him back to the scene of the crime.\n\nAgent Josh Cramer\nPlayed by Gonzalo Menendez, Agent Josh Cramer runs the FBI Field Office in Baltimore, Maryland, as well as the Organized Crime division in that city.

She was once a university literature professor, but is no longer since her diagnosis of schizophrenia. She currently resides at the Las Vegas-based Bennington Sanitarium, where Spencer committed her when he was eighteen. Her husband, William Reid, left her when Spencer was a child. The reason William left is because he was aware Diana witnessed a murder, as a family friend avenged his own son's murder. He was unable to live with this knowledge though he claims he tried; he said \"the weight of knowing what happened was just too much\". Much of Diana and Spencer's time while he was growing up was spent with her reading to him. Spencer writes her a letter every single day because he feels guilty about not visiting her. In season 11, Spencer takes some time off from the BAU to visit her. In \"Entropy\", he reveals she has early signs of dementia and when he first walked in her room, she didn't know who he was for three seconds.\n\nKevin Lynch\nPlayed by Nicholas Brendon, Kevin was Penelope Garcia's replacement when she was briefly suspended and hospitalized.E309 He is a former hacker like her, but he is far messier.

Garcia attempts to hack into the database under his watch. Kevin is unable to block her. They are each impressed with the other's work, but Garcia establishes dominance. When they finally meet face-to-face, they fall in love instantly. Kevin remains in awe of Garcia. They've developed a dating relationship in spite of Garcia's \"special\" relationship/mutual admiration with Agent Morgan. This is revealed at the beginning of \"Damaged\", when Agent Rossi shows up at Garcia's apartment only to find the quirky twosome showering together.E314\nIn the Season 6 finale, \"Supply & Demand\", they profess their love for each other. Later in the show Penelope brings him in for a case in Season 6.\n\nWilliam LaMontagne Jr.\nPlayed by Josh Stewart, LaMontagne is the husband of Special Agent Jennifer Jareau. He is a homicide detective who worked for the New Orleans Police Department and is now with the Metro PD. In the season two episode \"Jones\", it is revealed that his father William Sr. was a detective himself in the NOPD and was killed during Hurricane Katrina as he was working a case in his home and refused to leave during the mass evacuations. The case later resurfaced and LaMontagne enlisted the help of the BAU.E218 While they were there, he and JJ became romantically involved, although he wasn't mentioned again until \"In Heat\". In that episode, he was brought to Miami where the unsub had killed a friend and colleague of his. During the episode, it was revealed that he and JJ had been secretly contacting each other since \"Jones\". JJ didn't want to reveal their relationship since she believed it would complicate their personal lives, but in the end, they went public with it. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Prentiss, Morgan and Reid already knew about it. In the episode \"The Crossing\", JJ discovered she was pregnant and they have a boy named Henry. The actual status of JJ and Will's relationship (engaged, married, etc.) has not been disclosed, though they exchanged rings with Henry's birthstone in season four. In the season three finale, it is revealed that he transferred to Metro to move to Virginia to be with JJ and raise Henry together. To conclude season seven, he and JJ marry in a small ceremony in David Rossi's back yard.\nThe character was written back in after A.J. Cook told the writers she was pregnant, and as such JJ needed a love interest. In addition, one of the original plans for the season seven finale was to kill off Will. However, this idea was scrapped due to Paget's impending departure.\n\nJack Hotchner\nPlayed by Cade Owens, Jack Hotchner is the son of series regular Aaron Hotchner, his first appearance being in \"The Fox\". His mother, Haley Hotchner, is killed in season five by George Foyet (a.k.a. \"The Boston Reaper\") but is spared when his father gives him a secret signal to \"work the case\" (hide in the trunk in Hotch's office).

Jack is shown to have become good friends with Beth Clemmons, his father's new girlfriend.\n\nLindsey Vaughan\nPlayed by Gia Mantegna (Joe Mantegna's daughter), Lindsey Vaughan is the daughter of a hitman and first appears in the season three episode 3rd Life. The BAU initially believe her to be a victim of \"Jack\" until they track her to a school and discover that she is a willing accomplice, input under the witness protection program after a hit ordered by Irish mobsters designed to kill her father wound up killing her mother instead.

He was the only person to know of her pregnancy and her miscarriage during her time on the task force. In the same episode, they are both kidnapped by Tavin Askari, who was a traitor within the task force. They are both physically and mentally tortured into giving the access codes given to them during the mission. He is shocked to discover that Michael Hastings, one of the men they had worked with on the task force, was the mastermind behind the plan and threatened to rape JJ in order to give him the access codes. He gives in and is later stabbed by Askari, who was quickly killed by Hotch. Cruz is taken to the hospital following the incident and survives.

Joy is a reporter and true crime writer and is married with a 2-year-old son named Kai.\n\nFormer\nErin Strauss\nPlayed by Jayne Atkinson, Erin Strauss was the BAU Section Chief, the direct superior to SSA Aaron Hotchner. Her job lies in administration, and she has little field experience.

At the end of the episode, Hotchner and Morgan arrange for her to check in privately at a treatment facility, thus protecting her from losing her job.\nStrauss becomes more prominent in season eight. It is revealed in \"The Silencer\" that the newest member of the BAU team, Alex Blake, worked with her during the Amerithrax case, during which Strauss left her to take the fall when a linguistics flub led to the arrest of the wrong suspect. As a result, Blake did not get along with her afterwards. At the end of \"The Silencer\", Strauss tries apologizing to her, but Blake turns Strauss down. In \"Carbon Copy\", she specifically oversees the investigation into the Replicator, and by the end of the episode, she apologizes to Blake again, and this time, her apology is accepted. In \"Brothers Hotchner\", she is abducted by the Replicator, later revealed to be a former FBI agent named John Curtis, whom she left to take the blame along with Blake following the Amerithrax case. In \"The Replicator\", Erin Strauss is killed in the line of duty when Curtis poisons her with spiked wine and leaves her to die. She is found on the streets by Hotch, and she admits that the Replicator forced her at gunpoint to drink again. She dies in Hotch's arms after begging him to stay with her as she does not want to die alone. Strauss indirectly helps defeat Curtis post mortem when Rossi uses her sobriety chip to escape his trap, leaving him to possibly die in an explosion. After her funeral, the team celebrates her life during dinner at Rossi's garden, recalling her expert pistol marksmanship, discussing happy stories of her time with them, and acknowledging her as a good person.\n\nHaley Hotchner\nPlayed by Meredith Monroe, Haley Hotchner was the wife of Aaron Hotchner. She and Hotchner have a son, Jack.E204 They divorced due to Hotch's job and duties. In season three, Aaron Hotchner picks up his home phone when someone calls, but when he answers it, the caller hangs up. Haley's cellphone starts ringing immediately afterward. Hotch looks at Haley, but she does not say anything. It is implied that Haley might be cheating on Aaron, and that is why the person who called the home phone did not speak when a man answered. In the season five premiere episode, after George Foyet (a.k.a. \"The Boston Reaper\") shoots and stabs Aaron unconscious and puts him in the hospital, it is discovered by him that Foyet knows where Haley and Jack live, and they are placed in witness protection, later revealed to be living in New Jersey.  Afterwards, Foyet stalks Sam Kassmeyer, the U.S. Marshall protecting Haley and Jack, somehow gets into his house after he comes home from work, and brutally tortures him to try to get him to reveal their location.  In spite of being tortured and nearly dead at the scene (he would die shortly on the way to the hospital), Kassmeyer does not reveal their location.  However, Foyet then notices Kassmeyer's work cell phone on a small table next to his living room sofa that he put down after coming in, and guesses correctly that he has phone numbers (not listed as actual phone numbers) on speed dial and dials several asking for \"Haley.\"  After several unsuccessful attempts, he finally manages to get Haley's cell number and she answers that it is her.  Foyet apologizes for using her real name, then poses as a Marshall, tells her that Kassmeyer has been killed, that her location may have been compromised, that they need to protect her son, and that Aaron is dead.  Overwhelmed with fear, Haley then puts her complete trust in him.  Foyet further tells her not to call anyone after they're through talking, that her calls may be intercepted, to buy a disposable phone, and call him on it after getting into her vehicle; and that he would give her another number to call him on as well as further instructions on what to do before reassuring her that everything would be fine if she followed his instructions and that he was telling her the truth about Aaron.  He later tells her to go to the Hotchner's house before their divorce and before she and her son were placed in protection and that he would meet her there.  Despite the highly questionable instructions, Haley follows them completely.  She discovers the truth about the situation when Aaron is able to reach her by cell phone with her, Foyet, and Jack in the living room.  Jack, as mentioned above, is able to go into hiding and later emerges safely after Aaron talks in code with him over the phone, but after an emotional goodbye Aaron and Haley over it, Foyet shoots and brutally kills her.E509 Haley returned in season nine, episode five, in a vision while Hotch was recovering from complications from his stabbing 100 episodes earlier.E905 E501\n\nJordan Todd\nPlayed by Meta Golding, Todd is JJ's replacement while she's on maternity leave.

        "content": "The Pakistan national field hockey team (Urdu: پاکستان قومى ہاكى ٹیم) represents Pakistan in international field hockey.  Having played its first match in 1948, it is administered by the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), the governing body for hockey in Pakistan. It has been a member of the International Hockey Federation (FIH) since 1948 and was founding member of the Asian Hockey Federation (ASHF), which was formed in 1958.\nPakistan is one of the most successful national field hockey teams in the world with a record four Hockey World Cup wins (in 1971, 1978, 1982, and 1994).\nPakistan national team has played in all FIH World Cup editions with the only absence coming in 2014 and 2023. The Green Shirts are also most successful national team in the Asian Games, with eight gold medals: 1958, 1962, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1990, and 2010, the highest number of times a country has come first, and the only Asian team to have won the prestigious Champions Trophy, with three championships: 1978, 1980 and 1994. Pakistan has won a total of 29 official international titles to professional and grassroots level selections, with three gold medals in the Olympic Games field hockey tournaments: in Rome 1960, Mexico City 1968, and Los Angeles 1984.\nField hockey is the national sport of the country. The Pakistan national team has been ranked as the #1 team in the world in both 2000 and 2001 by the FIH. Former captain Sohail Abbas holds the World Record for the most international goals scored by a player in the history of international field hockey. Waseem Ahmad is the most-capped player for the team, having played 410 times between 1996 and 2013.\nPakistan is known for having fierce rivalry with India, having a record of playing each other in South Asian Games and Asian Games finals. They have competed against one another in 20 major tournaments finals so far, out of which Pakistan has won 13 titles in total. Pakistan have a record of winning the first three championships of Hockey Asia Cup in 1982, 1985 and 1989 against India in row. Apart from that, Pakistan has notable competitive rivalries with Netherlands and Australia.\nPakistan's home ground is National Hockey Stadium in Lahore. The current team head coach is Shahnaz Sheikh and the team manager is Saeed Khan.\n\nHistory\nEarly history (1948–1955)\nOriginally, the game had been brought by British servicemen to British India, and like cricket it soon became a popular sport with the local population. Following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, soon after the Pakistan Hockey Federation came into being in 1948. Prior to the partition of India, players playing for Pakistan competed for the Indian side. The Federation soon established and organized the Provincial Hockey/Sports Associations of West Punjab, East Bengal, Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Bahawalpur & Services Sports Board. Despite the limited resources available on 2 August 1948, Pakistan national team, led by Ali Iqtidar Shah Dara, officially went on to play their first international game against Belgium winning the game 2–1 at the 1948 London Olympics. Pakistan remained unbeaten defeating the Netherlands, Denmark and France during the group stage round and ended up placing fourth. During the group stages Pakistan defeat of Netherlands by 6–1 was the highlight for the team. Following the Olympics Pakistan went on a tour of Europe where the played Belgium, Netherlands and Italy and remained undefeated during the tour.\nThe next international outing of the team came after a gap of two years when Pakistan participated in an invitational competition in Spain in 1950. Pakistan were declared joined winners with Netherlands after the final ended in a draw and organizers decided to end the game rather than going for a deciding period of play, this was Pakistan's first international tournament victory. Again there was a gap of two years before Pakistan again appeared in an international event and this time it was the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki. Pakistan won the first knock-out game against France 6–0 but lost to Netherlands and Great Britain to again finish fourth at the event. Over the four years Pakistan made tours to European teams and also hosted them in their own country and in Asia Pakistan particularly made regular tours to Malaysia and Singapore with whom they played quite a few times.\n\nRise in Olympics and Asian honors  (1956–1970)\nPakistan won their first Olympic medal in 1956 at Melbourne when they reached the final but lost to India 1–0 to earn a silver medal, first podium finish this was also Pakistan's first medal at the Olympics. Field hockey was included in the Asian Games for the first time in 1958 at Tokyo. Pakistan were drawn against Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and archrivals India. They beat Japan 5–0 in their first match, then followed two consecutive victories over South Korea (8–0) and Malaysia (6–0). In the last match Pakistan drew 0–0 with India finishing top of the table in the round-robin format and clinched its first gold medal in an international competition.\n\nIn 1960 Rome Olympics where Pakistan played against in a group with Australia, Poland and Japan, winning all the matches. Pakistan then played the quarter-final round with Germany, winning the match 2–1 and advanced to the semi-final round where they defeated Spain. Pakistan eventually won the gold medal, defeating India 1–0 with a goal by Naseer Bunda in the final round held at the Olympic Velodrome and ended India's run of six successive gold medals at the Summer Olympic Games.\nIn the 1962 Asian Games, Pakistan earned its second gold medal with Chaudhry Ghulam Rasool as the captain leading the team to another successive award. However, during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics the national team ended up as runners-up for the second time after losing 1–0 to India in the final as well as finishing runners-up in the 1966 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand. \nPakistan won its second Olympic Games gold medal in Mexico at the 1968 Summer Olympics. It fielded what has since then often been considered the best hockey squad ever led by captain Tariq Aziz with Saeed Anwar, Khalid Mahmood, Gulraiz Akhtar and Tariq Niazi. Even though Rasool had retired, this team was still a force to be reckoned with. They won all six of their games—against Kenya, Great Britain, Malaysia, Australia, France and the Netherlands during group play, and against West Germany in the knockout round. Pakistan made the final for the fourth straight Olympics, and won the gold medal, as they had in 1960, this time by defeating Australia, 2–1 with goals from Muhammad Asad Malik and Abdul Rashid. Rashid was the top scorer for Pakistan with seven goals; Tanvir Dar finished with six goals.\n\nThe Golden Era (1970–1984)\nIn the group stage of the 1970 Asian Games, Pakistan was competing with tournament hosts Thailand and contenders Japan for top spot and a place in the finals. In their first match of the group, Pakistan scored thrice against Japan to clinch their first win, followed by defeating Hong Kong 10–0 to go to the top of the group. The team then draw 0–0 with Thailand and progressed to the knock-out round, where they won 5–0 over Malaysia. In the final, Pakistan faced India, winning 1–0 and sealing their third Asian Games gold medal.\n\nIn 1971, the first-ever Hockey World Cup was to be hosted by Pakistan. However, political issues would prevent that first competition from being played in Pakistan. The FIH had inadvertently scheduled the first World Cup to be played in Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Furthermore, Pakistan and India had been at war with each other only six years earlier. When Pakistan invited India to compete in the tournament, a crisis arose. Pakistanis, led by cricketer Abdul Hafeez Kardar, protested against India's participation in the Hockey World Cup. Given the intense political climate between Pakistan and India, the FIH decided to move the tournament elsewhere. In March 1971, coincidentally in the same month Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan, the FIH decided to move the first Hockey World Cup to the Real Club de Polo grounds in Barcelona, Spain, which was considered a neutral and peaceful European site. On 27 March 1971, in Brussels, the trophy was formally handed to FIH President Rene Frank by H.E Masood, the Pakistani Ambassador to Belgium. A total number of 10 teams qualified for the event and were broken up into two groups.\nThe Pakistani team was drawn in a group with hosts Spain, Australia, Japan and the Netherlands. The group was topped by Spain and Pakistan respectively, and both the teams advanced into the semi-finals. In the first semi-final of the tournament Pakistan ousted India 2–1 in a tense and closely contested game and in the second semi-final Spain played safe and defeated a spirited Kenya 1–0 to enter the finals against Pakistan. In the final Pakistan scored early but then strengthened its defense to hold out a 1–0 victory and win the first hockey World Cup, retaining its number one position in the world hockey rankings, closely followed by India and the Netherlands. Tanvir Dar finished as the top goal scorer at the tournament with eight goals.\nThe 1972 Munich Olympics, Pakistan lost the final to hosts West Germany losing the game 1–0 with a goal by Michael Krause and finished at fourth place, the following year, in the 1973 Hockey World Cup. The national team made a comeback in the international competition, by winning and retaining their title at the 1974 Asian Games but lost to their rivals India in the finals of the third hockey World Cup in 1975. 1976 Montreal Olympics saw the team secure their first bronze medal in the competition.\nThe year 1978 saw Pakistan national team win three major international tournaments: the third Hockey World Cup held at Buenos Aires, Argentina along with 1978 Asian Games and the first Champions Trophy. This was the first time a national team won three major titles in the history of international field hockey. In 1980, Pakistan Olympic Association, along with 65 countries, boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This resulted in Pakistan hockey team not participating at the field hockey competition  at the tournament. Pakistan hosted the 1980 and 1981 Champions Trophy tournaments, winning the title against West Germany in the final round in 1980 and finishing at fourth position a year later, held at the Hockey Club of Pakistan, Karachi. In the 1980s Pakistan won every international tournament it participated in including the 1982 World Cup in Mumbai and the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles where Pakistan won the gold medal defeating West Germany in the final. Pakistan also won the Asian Games and Asia Cup consecutively in this period.\n\nSurface change crisis and resurgence (1986–1996)\nAlthough hockey was being played at synthetic surfaces from the 1970s but it was only until the 1986 World Cup in London the FIH completely moved on from grass pitches to AstroTurf, synthetic turf made from plastic fibers to give a grass like look. The change of surface made the game much more fasted paced and to align the game with the new conditions the governing body vastly changed the rules of the game which focused more on strength and pace rather than stick work and technique which was the hallmark of Asian style of hockey. This negatively effected Pakistan since they couldn't replace all of the grass pitches with more expensive synthetic surfaces compared to more affluent European nations. This resulted in Pakistan performing very poorly at the World Cup in London where they won just one pool game and finished second last at 11th place. Pakistan however managed to cope up with the new changes in the game in the following years and started to regain some of its past dominance. Pakistan first finished runner-up at the 1990 World Cup at home in Lahore after losing the final to Netherlands and won a bronze medal at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. The most glorious highlight of the decade came in 1994 when Pakistan first won the 1994 Champions Trophy at home ground, their first title in the competition after 14 years and later in the year Pakistan won the Hockey World Cup in Sydney after winning a penalty shootout against Netherlands.\n\nPost-Atlanta Olympics (1998–2006)\nAfter Atlanta 1996 the first major competition was the 1998 Hockey World Cup in Utrecht Pakistan finished 5th at the tournament. The following year Pakistan won the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup for the first time in 1999. Pakistan finished fourth at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney after losing the bronze medal match to Australia, this was the last time Pakistan played for a medal at the Olympics. Pakistan finished 5th at 2002 World Cup and Kuala Lumpur and won bronze medal at the Champions Trophy the same year. At the 2002 Asian Games Pakistan finished fourth, the first time the team didn't won a medal at the competition. In 2003 Pakistan lost the Hockey Asia Cup final to India and in 2004 Pakistan had a busy schedule where they played in many tournaments in lead up to the Olympics but Pakistan finished 5th at the 2004 Athens Olympics later in December Pakistan finished third at the 2004 Champions Trophy in Lahore, the third consecutive bronze medal. In 2005 Pakistan had a highlight when they defeated Olympic champion Australia to win the 2005 Hockey RaboTrophy in Netherlands. Pakistan finished 6th the 2006 World Cup and failed even to progress from the pool stages of the 2007 Asia Cup.\n\nBeijing Olympics and competitive decline (2008–2012)\nThe 2008 Beijing Olympics proved to be the worst performance of the team at the event where they finished 8th. The year 2010 started with another record worst performance at the 2010 World Cup in New Delhi where the team finished last at 12th place but later in the same year Pakistan had a major success by winning the gold medal at the 2010 Asian Games in China. In 2011 Pakistan played in many minor tournaments in lead up to the 2012 Olympics where they finished 7th. Later in the year 2012 Pakistan won bronze medal at the 2012 Champions Trophy in Melbourne after upsetting tournaments favorites like Germany. The Pakistani national team most successful tournament, in this period, was the Asian Hockey Champions Trophy winning the trophy first in 2012 against India and finishing as runners-up in the first edition of Asian Hockey Champions Trophy in 2011. During this period despite not any major team honor won the Pakistan team had world renowned individual players in world hockey in the likes of Sohail Abbas who remained top scorer at the 2002 World Cup and 2004 Olympics, he later broke the record of highest goalscorer in international hockey with a total of 348 goals and Rehan Butt who was twice voted as the Best Asian Player by Asian Hockey Federation, Shakeel Abbasi, Salman Akbar and Muhammad Saqlain.\n\nWorld Cup and Olympic absentee (2013–2020)\nPakistan, after having failed to get a direct entrance for the 2014 World Cup, were handed a last chance to qualify for the event by winning the 2013 Asia Cup, but they finished third and failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in their history. Pakistan failed to qualify for the Olympics for the first time at Rio 2016 after failing a qualification berth at the 2014–15 FIH Hockey World League. From 2016 to 2017, Pakistan performed poorly in different competitions even featuring a record 9–1 defeat against Australia in 2017. In 2018, Roelant Oltmans of Netherlands was brought in as coach and the team showed some improvement, but still performed poorly at the 2018 World Cup, failing to win a single match. Pakistan again failed to qualify for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, losing the Olympic Qualifiers against Netherlands over a two-legged tie in 2019.\n\nContinued struggles and Olympic absentee (2021–present)\nPHF announced Pakistan's participation for the 2021 Asian Champions Trophy, the team's first appearance in an international competition after a gap of two years. A 20-man squad was announced with Siegfried Aikman as head coach prior to the tournament. Pakistan could not qualify for the 2023 World Cup despite it being a 16-team event. Pakistan then played 2022 Common wealth games where Pakistan performs poorly and finished 7th, In December 2022 Pakistan participated in 2022 Nations cup were Pakistan finished 7th, In July 2023 Shahnaz Sheikh was appointed as the head coach of team for 2023 Asian Champions Trophy, In August 2023 PHF announced 36-man squad for Asian Games 2023, In the Asian Games 2023 Pakistan lost to India by 10-2 which was the biggest defeat in their history, Pakistan finished 5th in the Asian Games 2023.Pakistan also failed to qualify for the 2024 Summer Olympics, In 2024 Roelant Oltmans was bring as coach of Pakistan for the 2024 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup and the 2024 Nations Cup.\n\nLogo and stadium\nThe motif of the Pakistan national field hockey team has a star and crescent on a dark green field; with a vertical white stripe at the hoist, usually in green, white color, as represented in the flag of Pakistan.\nPakistan played at a number of different venues across the country, though by 1978, this had largely settled down to having National Hockey Stadium (also known as Gaddafi Hockey Stadium, named after former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi) in Lahore as the primary venue, with Faisalabad Hockey Stadium and the Hockey Club of Pakistan used on occasions where the National Hockey Stadium was unavailable for home matches. The stadium is considered to be the biggest international field hockey stadium in the world, and holds a capacity of 45,000 spectators.\nThe Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) has its headquarters at the stadium. Pakistan has hosted many international matches and competitions such as the Hockey Asia Cup of 1982 and Champions Trophy tournament in 1978, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1992, 1994, 1998, and 2004 along with the 1990 Hockey World Cup, where Pakistan lost 3–1 to the Netherlands in the final.\n\nHonors and recognition\nSince its breakthrough in the 1948 Summer Olympics, Pakistan has won more than 20 official titles, which are detailed below:\n\nSummer Olympics:\nGold medal: 1960 Rome, 1968 Mexico City, 1984 Los Angeles\nSilver medal: 1956 Melbourne, 1964 Tokyo, 1972 Munich\nBronze medal: 1976 Montreal, 1992 Barcelona\nWorld Cup:\nGold medal: 1971, 1978, 1982, 1994\nSilver medal: 1975, 1990\nChampions Trophy:\nGold medal: 1978, 1980, 1994\nSilver medal: 1983, 1984, 1988, 1991, 1996, 1998, 2014\nBronze medal: 1986, 1992, 1995, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2012,\nSultan Azlan Shah Cup:\nGold medal: 1998, 2000, 2003\nSilver medal: 1983, 1987, 1991, 1994, 2004, 2011, 2024\nBronze medal: 1985, 2005, 2022\nAsian Champions Trophy:\nGold medal: 2012, 2013, 2018\nSilver medal: 2011, 2016\nAsia Cup:\nGold medal: 1982, 1985, 1989\nSilver medal: 1999, 2003, 2009\nBronze medal: 1994, 2013, 2017\nAsian Games:\nGold medal: 1958, 1962, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1990, 2010\nSilver medal: 1966, 1986, 2014\nBronze medal: 1994, 1998, 2006\nCommonwealth Games:\nSilver medal: 2006\nBronze medal: 2002\nSouth Asian Games:\nGold medal: 2006, 2010, 2016\nSilver medal: 1995\nAfro-Asian Games:\nSilver medal: 2003\nHockey Champions Challenge:\nSilver medal: 2009\n\nCompetitive record\nTeam performance\nTBD (to be determined), DNQ (did not qualify), DNP (did not participate)\n\nRecords\nAs of 27 October 2019\nPlayers in bold text are still active with Pakistan\n\nTop goal scorers\nMost-capped players\nPlayers\nOfficials\nCurrent players\nThe following 18 players were named in the squad for the 2024 Men's Asian Champions Trophy in Hulunbuir.\nCaps and goals current as of 9 June 2024, following the match against South Africa.\n\nResults and fixtures\n2024\n2024 Men's FIH Hockey Olympic Qualifiers\n\n2024 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup\n\n2023–24 Men's FIH Hockey Nations Cup\n\n2024 Asian Champions trophy\n\nHead-to-head record\nRecord last updated as of the following matches:\nPakistan vs South Korea at Hulunbuir, 2024 Men's Asian Champions Trophy, 17 September 2024\n\nSee also\nPakistan Hockey League\nIndia–Pakistan field hockey rivalry\nPakistan men's national under-21 field hockey team\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website \nFIH profile"

The group's motto is \"A person is what he is and not what he looks like\".\n\nHistory\nThe club claims to have a history in Piobbico, Italy, from 1879. It was launched again in 1963 as a marriage agency for the town's single women.\nThe World Association of Ugly People club campaigns against discrimination in the workplace based on looks. It attempts to make society more aware of ugly people's problems. It also helps people overcome their phobias and, in some cases, to find partners.\nIn 2007, the group unveiled a monument dedicated to ugly people in Piobbico's town square. The monument depicts an unknown person looking at his reflection in a mirror.\n\nTraditions\nThe club's emblem is the head of a wild boar. The club's crest features a reclining man smoking a pipe with the slogan: \"Ugliness is a virtue, beauty is slavery\".\nThe club's patron is Vulcan from Roman mythology. At birth Vulcan was so ugly that his mother threw him over a cliff. He survived and became a skilled blacksmith. For providing Achilles with superior weapons, he was admitted to Mount Olympus where he married the beautiful Venus, goddess of love.\n\nPresident\nThe members of the World Association of Ugly People elect their president annually during the Festival of the Ugly. This event is hosted by the small town of Piobbico in the Marche region of Italy every year on the first Sunday of September.\nEvery year until 2007, Telesforo Iacobelli won the top prize and was president of the club, owing to his dedication to the organization.

        "content": "Fifty Shades Freed is the third and final installment of the erotic romance Fifty Shades Trilogy by British author E. L. James. After accepting entrepreneur CEO Christian Grey's proposal in Fifty Shades Darker, Anastasia Steele must adjust not only to married life but to her new husband's wealthy lifestyle and controlling nature. The paperback edition was first published in April 2012.\n\nPlot\nAnastasia 'Ana' Steele and Christian Grey return to Seattle after a long honeymoon. Christian is upset to find that Ana has kept her maiden name at work. Ana reluctantly starts using the name Grey after realizing how important it is to Christian. As a belated wedding gift, Christian gives Seattle Independent Publishing to Ana, planning to rename it Grey Publishing.\nWhile Christian is on a business trip in New York, Anastasia goes out for a drink with longtime friend Kate Kavanagh, doing so against Christian's wishes. Returning home, she finds that her former boss, Jack Hyde, who was fired for attempting to sexually assault her, has been apprehended by the security staff. Duct tape is found in his pocket and in his van there are tranquilizers and a ransom note—all indications that he intended to kidnap her. Hyde is arrested. Angry with Ana for defying him, Christian cuts short his business trip. At Seattle, Christian sulks while Ana sleeps. Eventually, the two argue and Ana berates him for being possessive. She demands more freedom and access to her friends. Christian relents after realizing how much Ana's friends mean to her and that she did the right thing by staying with Kate rather than at home. He later surprises her with a trip to Aspen, with Kate, Elliot, Mia, and Kate's brother, Ethan. While there, Elliot proposes to Kate, who accepts.\nAna's step-father, Ray, is in a medically-induced coma after a car accident. After he awakens a few days later, Ana and Christian arrange to move him to Seattle to recover. It is also Ana's birthday weekend, and Christian surprises her with all her family and friends at a dinner. He gives her a charm bracelet with the charms representing all their \"firsts\" including an ice cream cone to represent their \"vanilla\" relationship. Christian also gives her a car. Soon after, Ana learns that she is pregnant. Christian angrily accuses her of getting pregnant on purpose and leaves. He returns the next morning drunk, claiming Ana will choose the baby - whom he believes to be a boy - over him. Ana says it could be a girl, though Christian refuses to accept that due to his sexist nature. Ana becomes furious when she discovers a text message on Christian's phone from his ex-lover Elena Lincoln, the woman who seduced him when he was fifteen and introduced him to the BDSM lifestyle. The message indicates they met for a drink.\nThe next two mornings, Anastasia and Christian barely speak to each other, though he insists his and Elena's relationship is long-since over. When Christian is away on business for a few days, Ana receives a call from Hyde. He has kidnapped Mia Grey and demands $5 million in two hours. He warns Ana not to tell anyone or he will kill Mia.\nAnastasia feigns illness and returns home to escape her bodyguard. She takes a gun and goes to the bank. Before collecting the money, the suspicious bank manager calls Christian, who asks Ana what is going on. He initially believes she is leaving him, but realizes something is amiss. She then approaches a waiting car, shocked that Hyde's accomplice is Elizabeth Morgan, her co-worker. Hyde had instructed Ana to ditch her phone, but she tricks him by hiding her phone in the bag of money and handing over the manager's phone to be discarded instead. With her real phone in the bag, Christian and Taylor, who have already learned of Mia's disappearance and called 911, trace Ana's location. When Ana and Liz arrive at Hyde's location, an angry Hyde hits Ana out of vengeance for losing his job and Ana falls to the ground, hitting her head, causing Elizabeth to worry for Ana's safety. Angry, Elizabeth argues with Hyde.  With Ana on the ground, and Hyde distracted by Liz, Ana shoots Hyde in the leg. As she starts to black out she hears Christian calling her name.\nAna wakes three days later in the hospital with Christian at her side. Despite still anxious about fatherhood, he realizes how important their baby is to her, and they reconcile. Ana returns home the next day. Christian learns from his private investigator, that he and Hyde had the same foster family. Christian tells Ana about how he met and was seduced by Elena. By introducing Christian to the world of BDSM, Elena helped him. If she had not intervened, he would still be plagued with horrible memories of his mother and would never have managed to control his life. He had been recently looking to talk to someone about his problems, and after not being able to contact his psychiatrist, Dr. Flynn, Christian went to Elena's salon. She took him for a drink and to help him relax. Despite having made a pass at him, Elena realized that Christian loved Ana and agreed to leave on good terms. Christian reassures Ana that she did the right thing to call him out for his behavior, as Flynn had been right; he still has a lot of growing up to do.\nThe next day, a furious Christian discovers that Elena's ex-husband, Eric Lincoln, had bailed Jack from jail out of spite for her affair with Christian. Christian tells Ana that after learning about the affair, Eric severely beat Elena and divorced her. Despite Christian's urging, Elena refused to press charges against Eric out of guilt for the affair. Christian retaliated by buying out Eric Lincoln's logging company to sell it off. Elizabeth confessed to the police that she was blackmailed by Hyde to be his accomplice.\nSeven months later, Ana and Christian have a son named Theodore Raymond Grey, nicknamed Teddy. Two years later, Ana is six months pregnant with their second child, Phoebe. \nElliot and Kate have married and have a two-month-old daughter named Ava. After having BDSM sex, Ana and Christian get ready to celebrate Teddy's second birthday with their family and friends.\n\nCharacters\nReception\nFifty Shades Freed entered The New York Times Best Seller list at number three. In the UK the novel sold over two million copies.\n\nFilm adaptation\nSam Taylor-Johnson, the director of the film adaptation of the first installment of the book series, Fifty Shades of Grey, confirmed on 6 February 2015 that both Fifty Shades Freed and the second book in the trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker, would also be adapted for film. In November 2015, Universal Studios announced that both films would be shot back-to-back with principal photography scheduled to commence in early 2016. The film released on 9 February 2018.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial author page"

        "content": "Rodrigo Roa Duterte  (English: , Tagalog: [ɾodˈɾiː.ɣo ˈɾoː.ɐ dʊˈtɛːɾ.tɛ] ; born March 28, 1945), also known as Digong, Rody, and by the initials DU30 and PRRD, is a Filipino lawyer and politician who served as the 16th president of the Philippines from 2016 to 2022. He is the chairperson of Partido Demokratiko Pilipino (formerly PDP–Laban), the ruling political party in the Philippines during his presidency. Duterte is the first president of the Philippines to be from Mindanao, and is the oldest person to assume office, beginning his term at age 71.\nBorn in Maasin, Leyte (now in Southern Leyte), Duterte moved to Davao as a child where his father, Vicente Duterte, served as provincial governor. He studied political science at the Lyceum of the Philippines University, graduating in 1968, before obtaining a law degree from San Beda College of Law in 1972. He then worked as a lawyer and was a prosecutor for Davao City, before becoming vice mayor and, subsequently, mayor of the city in the wake of the 1986 People Power Revolution. Duterte won seven terms and served as mayor of Davao for over 22 years, during which the once crime-ridden city became peaceful and investor-friendly. \nDuterte's 2016 presidential campaign led to his election victory. During his presidency, his domestic policy focused on combating the illegal drug trade by initiating the controversial war on drugs, fighting crime and corruption, and intensified efforts against terrorism and communist insurgency. He launched a massive infrastructure plan, initiated liberal economic reforms, streamlined government processes, and proposed a shift to a federal system of government which was ultimately unsuccessful. He also oversaw the controversial burial of Ferdinand Marcos, the 2017 Battle of Marawi, and the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He declared the intention to pursue an \"independent foreign policy\", and strengthened relations with China and Russia. He initially announced his candidacy for vice president in the 2022 election; in October 2021, he said he was retiring from politics. The next month, he filed his candidacy for senator but withdrew it on December 14.\nDuterte's political positions have been described as populist, as well as nationalist. His political success has been aided by his vocal support for the extrajudicial killing of drug users and other criminals. His career has sparked numerous protests and attracted controversy, particularly over human rights issues and his controversial comments. Duterte has repeatedly confirmed to have personally killed criminal suspects during his term as mayor of Davao. Extrajudicial killings that were allegedly committed by the Davao Death Squad between 1998 and 2016 during Duterte's mayoralty have also been scrutinized by human-rights groups and the Office of the Ombudsman. The victims were mainly alleged drug users, alleged petty criminals, and street children. The International Criminal Court opened a preliminary investigation into Duterte's drug war in 2018, prompting Duterte to withdraw the Philippines from the body in response. He is the only president in the history of the Philippines not to declare his assets and liabilities. Duterte's popularity and domestic approval rating remained relatively high throughout his presidency and by the end of his term, he was the most popular post-People Power Revolution president.\n\nEarly years\nRodrigo Roa Duterte was born on March 28, 1945, in Maasin, Southern Leyte. His father was Vicente Gonzales Duterte (1911–1968), a Cebuano lawyer, and his mother, Soledad Gonzales Roa (1916–2012), was a schoolteacher from Cabadbaran, Agusan and a civic leader of Maranao descent. Duterte has said that his grandfather was Chinese and hailed from Xiamen in Fujian, China. Duterte has four siblings: Eleanor, Jocelyn, Emmanuel and Benjamin.\nDuterte's father was mayor of Danao, Cebu, and subsequently the provincial governor of (the then-undivided) Davao province. Rodrigo's cousin Ronald was mayor of Cebu City from 1983 to 1986. Ronald's father, Ramon Duterte, also held that position from 1957 to 1959. The Dutertes consider the Cebu-based political families of the Durano and the Almendras clan as relatives. Duterte also has relatives from the Roa clan in Leyte through his mother's side. Duterte's family lived in Maasin, and in his father's hometown in Danao, until he was four years old. Duterte was heavily influenced by his mother, who unlike Vicente was a staunch anti-Marcos activist, which led the young Duterte to have a divided opinion on the Marcoses. Duterte later said Marcos could have been the best president, but unfortunately he was a dictator. The Dutertes initially moved to Mindanao in 1948 but still went back and forth to the Visayas until 1949. They finally settled in the Davao Region in 1950. Vicente worked as a lawyer engaged in private practice. Soledad worked as a teacher until 1952, when Vicente entered politics.\n\nEducation and early law career\nDuterte went to Laboon Elementary School in Maasin for a year. He spent his remaining elementary days at Santa Ana Elementary School in Davao City, where he completed his primary education in 1956. He finished his secondary education in the High School Department of Holy Cross College of Digos (now Cor Jesu College) in Digos, Davao province, after being expelled twice from previous schools, including one in the Ateneo de Davao University (AdDU) High School due to misconduct. He graduated in 1968 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science at the Lyceum of the Philippines in Manila.\nHe obtained a law degree from San Beda College of Law in 1972. In the same year, he passed the bar exam. Duterte eventually became a special counsel at the City Prosecution Office in Davao City from 1977 to 1979, fourth assistant city prosecutor from 1979 to 1981, third assistant city prosecutor from 1981 to 1983, and second assistant city prosecutor from 1983 to 1986.\n\nSexual abuse claims\nDuterte has claimed he was sexually abused by a priest when he was a minor. After he was challenged by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and AdDU officials to name the priest and file a case against him, Duterte then revealed the priest's name as Mark Falvey (d. 1975). The Jesuits of the Society of Jesus in the Philippines confirmed that according to press reports in the United States, in May 2007, the Society of Jesus agreed to a tentative payout of US$16 million to settle claims that Falvey sexually abused at least nine children in Los Angeles from 1959 to 1975. Accusations against Falvey began in 2002 but he was never charged with a crime. In May 2008, the Diocese of Sacramento paid a $100,000-settlement to a person allegedly raped and molested by Mark's brother, Arthur Falvey. However, it was not clearly indicated in the report if Mark Falvey was assigned at the Jesuit-run Ateneo de Davao.\nWhen asked why he did not complain when the abuse supposedly happened, Duterte claimed that he was too young to complain about the priest's abuse and was intimidated by authorities at that time. He also stated that he never disclosed that information after he was expelled and moved to a different high school and especially not to his family.\n\nShooting of student at law school\nDuterte stated at a rally in April 2016 that he shot a fellow student who had bullied him about his Visayan origin as well as other students of the same ethnicity, while at San Beda law college. He said, \"But the truth is, I'm used to shooting people. When we were about to graduate from San Beda, I shot a person.\" Duterte said that he shot the student in a corridor at the college when the said student called him names again. He later told a reporter that the student survived, but refused to answer any further questions about the incident.\nHowever, in an interview aired on 24 Oras and published on the official GMA News Online website on April 22, 2016, retired labor arbiter Arthur Amansec said Duterte and Octavio Goco at that time were both playing with a gun as it was normal for students to bring guns to school in the seventies. Amansec is Duterte's former classmate in San Beda College who witnessed the incident. He added that \"the bullet hit the school's wooden floor and was embedded there.\" Amansec emphasized that Duterte and Goco remained friends until Goco died in the United States years later.\n\nPolitical career in Davao City\nAfter the 1986 People Power Revolution that toppled the regime of President Ferdinand Marcos, Duterte was appointed officer-in-charge vice mayor of Davao City by President Corazon Aquino. In the 1988 local elections, he ran for mayor under the banner of Lakas ng Dabaw, defeating former OIC Mayor Zafiro Respicio by a margin of 6,000 votes.\nDuterte set a precedent by designating deputy mayors to represent the administrative districts, as well as the Lumad and Moro peoples in the city government. This was later copied by other cities in other parts of the Philippines.\nIn December 1990, Duterte joined the Nacionalista Party upon the persuasion of Senator Juan Ponce Enrile. In 1992, he successfully defended his seat from 1st district representative Prospero Nograles. In 1995, after Flor Contemplacion, a Filipina, was executed in Singapore after confessing to a double murder, Duterte allegedly burned a flag of Singapore (though this claim was later denied) and joined 1,000 employees of Davao City in protest.\nIn 1998, because he was term-limited to run again for mayor, Duterte ran and won as congressman of the city's 1st district under the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (LAMMP). He was a member of five House committees, namely: National Defense, Public Order and Security, Health, Transportation and Communications, and Cooperative Development. He filed 64 measures, including 45 bills, with one enacted into law—Republic Act No. 8969, which declared the third Friday of August a special holiday in Davao City. He expressed disinterest with his new post, describing it as less engaging compared to his time as mayor. He attempted to resign in 1999 after his son Paolo was accused of mauling a hotel guard, but both House Speaker Manny Villar and President Joseph Estrada declined his resignation.\nIn 2001, he ran again for mayor of Davao against his former ally, Mayor Benjamin de Guzman. He won against de Guzman and was elected for a fourth term. He was re-elected in 2004, defeating de Guzman for the second time, and in 2007 with virtually no opposition.\n\nIn 2010, he was elected vice mayor, succeeding his daughter Sara, who was elected as mayor.\nIn 2013, Davao City sent rescue and medical teams to Tacloban to give aid to the victims of Typhoon Haiyan (locally known in the country as Typhoon Yolanda). Financial assistance was also given to Bohol and Cebu for earthquake victims.\nDuterte also passed Davao City's Women Development Code, which aims \"to uphold the rights of women and the belief in their worth and dignity as human beings\". Duterte banned swimsuit competitions in beauty pageants in Davao City. He gained prominence for supporting the first-ever Gawad Kalinga Village inside a jail facility in Davao City. It is a home-type jail with ten cottages built inside the compound, which now serve as homes for female inmates.\n\nLaw and order\nDuring Duterte's tenure as mayor, Davao City experienced economic boom and a significant decrease in crime from being a conflict-ridden area between communists and right-wing groups during the 1970s and 1980s, and is constantly rated as among the safest in the country. The city also ranks high in the world according to crowdsourced survey site Numbeo, a narrative that gained currency in the national media, creating a widespread public perception that has been a significant factor in establishing support for his nationwide drug policy. The city was also awarded \"Most Child-Friendly City for Highly-Urbanized Category\" in 1998, 1999, 2013 and 2014.\nUnder Duterte's watch, the city council imposed a prohibition on selling, serving, drinking, and consuming alcoholic beverages from 01:00 until 08:00 each morning. Duterte signed Executive Order No. 39, reducing the speed limits for all kinds of motor vehicles within the territorial jurisdiction of Davao City in the interest of public safety and order. Duterte also signed Executive Order No. 04 creating the implementing of rules and regulations for a new comprehensive anti-smoking ordinance. A firecracker ban was also implemented by the City Council through the support of Duterte. Davao acquired 10 ambulances for central 911 intended for medical emergencies and 42 mobile patrol vehicles and motorcycles for the Davao City Police Office. Duterte, through Executive Order No. 24, ordered all shopping malls and commercial centers to install, operate and maintain high end and high definition closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras at all entrance and exit points of their premises.\nIn early September 2015, an incident was reported of a tourist being forced to swallow his own cigarette butt in a local bar in Davao City after the tourist refused to comply with the public anti-smoking ordinance of the city. Duterte was contacted by the bar owner and the then-mayor personally went into the bar and forced the tourist to swallow his cigarette butt. Duterte was then met with criticisms especially from the Commission on Human Rights (CHR).\n\nAlleged involvement with Davao Death Squad\nDuterte has been linked by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to extrajudicial killings of over 1,400 alleged criminals and street children by vigilante death squads. In the April 2009 UN General Assembly of the Human Rights Council, the UN report (Eleventh Session Agenda item 3, par 21) said, \"The Mayor of Davao City has done nothing to prevent these killings, and his public comments suggest that he is, in fact, supportive.\" Duterte stressed that the concept of human rights for criminals is Western and should not apply to the Philippines.\n\nWe're the ninth-safest city. How do you think I did it? How did I reach that title among the world's safest cities? Kill them all [criminals].\nDuterte has denied responsibility for the extrajudicial killings. He has also frequently announced his support for them. In 2015, Duterte confirmed his links to extrajudicial killings in Davao, and warned that, if elected president, he may kill up to 100,000 criminals; he challenged human rights officials to file a case against him if they could provide evidence of his links with vigilante groups. In October 2023, Duterte admitted on his talk show program Gikan sa Masa, para sa Masa to using intelligence funds to finance the extrajudicial killings done during his time as mayor.\n\nFederalism advocacy\nIn September 2014, Duterte and former mayors and governors, calling themselves the Mindanao Council of Leaders, advocated for a federalist government. A month later, Duterte attended an event sponsored by the Federal Movement for a Better Philippines in Cebu City.\nIn December 2014, Duterte held a summit entitled \"Mindanaons Forging Unity Toward a Federal System of Government\".\n\n2016 presidential campaign\nProspects of Duterte running for president in the 2016 elections began in February 2015, during which Duterte, then outgoing Mayor of Davao City, re-entered the PDP-Laban party, who courted him to run for president. A month later, Duterte emerged as a preferred presidential candidate in a Pulse Asia poll; tied with Manila mayor and former president Joseph Estrada, Duterte ranked third behind Senator Grace Poe and frontrunner, Vice President Jejomar Binay. In the following months leading to October, however, Duterte repeatedly declined his supporters' clamors for him to run as president because of what he described as a \"flawed government system\", as well as lack of funds and opposition from his family members—notably, from his daughter Sara. Additionally, Duterte said he will retire from politics after his mayorship ends, but only if Sara runs as mayor.\nIn an unforeseen development, PDP-Laban standard bearer Martin Diño withdrew his candidacy on October 29 and named Duterte as his substitute. A month later, Duterte formally announced his presidential bid and accepted Alan Peter Cayetano's offer to be his running mate; Duterte also named Sara as his substitute for Mayor of Davao City.\n\nDuring his campaign, Duterte made controversial remarks, including promising to kill tens of thousands of criminals and eradicate crime in six months. He also said his presidency would be \"a bloody one\", and that he would pardon himself, the police, and soldiers accused of human rights abuses at the end of his six-year term. Duterte also apologized after saying out of anger when recalling the events that he \"should have been first\" to rape Jacqueline Hamill, an Australian missionary who was gang-raped and killed during the 1989 Davao hostage crisis. After the United States' and Australia's ambassadors to the Philippines criticized him for the rape comments, Duterte threatened to sever diplomatic ties with the countries if elected.\n\nConstitutional reform\nDuterte campaigned for decentralization and a shift to a federal government during the 2016 presidential election. In an October 2014 forum organized by Federal Movement for a Better Philippines in Cebu City prior to joining the presidential race, the then-mayor of Davao City called for the creation of two federal states for Moro people as a solution to the problems besetting Mindanao. Mayor Duterte said that Nur Misuari and his Moro National Liberation Front do not see eye-to-eye with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front which the administration of President Benigno Aquino III had inked a peace deal with. He also said that the \"template of the Bangsamoro Basic Law is federal\", but what is granted to the Bangsamoro should also be granted to other Moro groups and other regions in the country. In a dialogue with the Makati Business Club prior to the elections, Duterte said he is open to \"toning down the Constitution\" to accommodate more foreign investors to the Philippines. He also said he is open to up to 70 percent foreign ownership of businesses in the country and foreign lease of lands up to 60 years, but will \"leave it to Congress to decide\".\n\nElection to the presidency\nOn May 30, 2016, the 16th Congress of the Philippines proclaimed Duterte as the president-elect of the Philippines after he topped the official count by the Congress of the Philippines for the 2016 presidential election with 16,601,997 votes, 6.6 million more than his closest rival, Mar Roxas. Camarines Sur representative Leni Robredo on the other hand, was proclaimed as the vice president-elect of the Philippines with 14,418,817 votes, narrowly defeating Senator Bongbong Marcos by 263,473 votes.\n\nPresidency (2016–2022)\nDuterte was inaugurated as the sixteenth president of the Philippines on June 30, 2016, succeeding Benigno Aquino III. At age 71, Duterte became the oldest person elected to the presidency, the first local chief executive to get elected straight to the Office of the President, the second Cebuano president (after Sergio Osmeña), and the first Visayan president from Mindanao.\n\nEarly actions\nShortly after his inauguration, Duterte held his first Cabinet meeting to lay out their first agenda, which included the country's disaster risk reduction management, decongesting Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila; he also expressed his ideas and concerns regarding the territorial disputes in the South China Sea prior to the announcement of the verdict of the Philippines' arbitration case against China over the issue, which the Philippines later won. On July 4, he issued his first executive order, allowing his Cabinet Secretary to supervise over several agencies that focus on poverty reduction. He called for the reimposition of capital punishment in the country to execute criminals involved in \"heinous\" crimes, such as illegal drug trade, insisting on hanging.\nDuring his first 100 days in office, Duterte issued an executive order on freedom of information, launched an intensified campaign against illegal drugs, sought to resume peace talks with communist insurgents, formulated a comprehensive tax reform plan, led efforts to pass the Bangsamoro Basic Law, made efforts to streamline government transactions, launched the nationwide 9–1–1 rescue and 8888 complaint hotlines, established a one-stop service center for overseas Filipino workers, and increased in the combat and incentive pay of soldiers and police personnel.\nDuterte made moves to limit US visiting troops in the country, and has reached out to China and Russia to improve relations. He launched tirades against international critics, particularly, United States President Barack Obama, the US government, the United Nations, and the European Union, which expressed condemnation to his unprecedented war on drugs that led to the deaths of about 3,300 people, half of which were killed by unknown assailants, and the arrest of 22,000 drug suspects and surrender of about 731,000 people.\n\nFollowing the September 2 bombing in Davao City that killed 14 people in the city's central business district, on September 3 Duterte declared a \"state of lawlessness\", and on the following day issued Proclamation No. 55 to officially declare a \"state of national emergency on account of lawless violence in Mindanao\". On December 7, Duterte signed Executive Order No. 10 creating a consultative committee to review the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines.\nDuterte adjusted to working and residing at the Malacañang Palace by dividing his workweek between Manila and Davao City, spending three days in each city and utilizing the Malacañang of the South while in Davao.\nA Pulse Asia survey conducted from July 2–8 showed that Duterte had a trust rating of 91%, the highest of the six presidents since the Marcos dictatorship. In December 2016, Duterte was ranked 70th on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People.\n\nDomestic policy\nEconomic policy\nDuterte's socioeconomic policies, referred to as DuterteNomics, include tax reform, infrastructure development, social protection programs, and other policies to promote economic growth and human development in the country. Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III has said that the government required what he describes as an \"audacious\" economic strategy in order for the Philippines to \"catch up with its more vibrant neighbors\" by 2022 and help it achieve high-income economy status within a generation. The term DuterteNomics was coined to describe the economic policy of the Duterte administration.\nDuterte initiated liberal economic reforms to attract foreign investors. In March 2022, he signed Republic Act No. 11647 which amended the Foreign Investment Act of 1991, effectively relaxing restrictions on foreign investments by allowing foreigners to invest in a local enterprise up to 100% of its capital. He signed Republic Act No. 11659, amending the 85-year-old Public Service Act, allowing full foreign ownership of public services, which include airports, expressways, railways, telecommunications, and shipping industries, in the country.\nDuterte reformed the country's tax system in an effort to make the country's tax system fairer, simpler, and more efficient. In December 2017, he signed Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Law (TRAIN Law) which excludes those earning an annual taxable income of ₱250,000 and below from paying the personal income tax, while raising higher excise taxes on vehicles, sugar-sweetened beverages, petroleum products, tobacco and other non-essential goods. Revenues collected from the TRAIN law will help fund the administration's massive infrastructure program. In March 2021, to attract more investments and maintain fiscal stability, Duterte signed the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act, reducing the 30 percent corporate income tax rate to 25 percent for firms with assets above ₱100 million and to 20 percent for smaller firms. Duterte raised sin taxes on tobacco and vapor products in July 2019, and alcohol beverages and electronic cigarettes in January 2020, to fund the Universal Health Care Act and reduce incidence of deaths and diseases associated with smoking and alcohol consumption.\nDuterte's tax reform program has garnered both support and criticism. Critics have argued that the administration's tax policy would burden the poor. The implementation of the TRAIN Law triggered protests from various left-wing groups. On January 15, 2018, protesters gathered at various public market sites, calling for the revocation of TRAIN. However, proponents of the program cite its appeal to foreign investors and economic benefits as the main reasons behind tax reform.\n\nInfrastructure development\nTo reduce poverty, encourage economic growth, and reduce congestion in Metro Manila, the Duterte administration launched its comprehensive infrastructure program, Build, Build, Build, on April 18, 2017. The program, which forms part of the administration's socioeconomic policy, aimed to usher in the country's \"Golden Age of Infrastructure\" by increasing the share of spending on public infrastructure in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) from 5.4 percent in 2017 to 7.4 percent in 2022. The administration, in 2017, shifted its infrastructure funding policy from public-private partnerships (PPPs) of previous administrations to government revenues and official development assistance (ODA), particularly from Japan and China, but has since October 2019 engaged with the private sector for additional funding.\nThe administration revised its list of Infrastructure Flagship Projects (IFPs) under the Build, Build, Build program from 75 to 100 in November 2019, then to 104, and finally, to 112 in 2020, expanding its scope to include health, information and communications technology, and water infrastructure projects to support the country's economic growth and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Some major projects include the Subic-Clark Railway, the North–South Commuter Railway from New Clark City to Calamba, Laguna, the Metro Manila Subway, the expansion of Clark International Airport the Mindanao Railway (Tagum-Davao-Digos Segment), and the Luzon Spine Expressway Network By April 2022, 12 IFPs have been completed by the administration, while 88 IFPs, which were on their \"advanced stage\", have been passed on to the succeeding administration for completion.\nFrom June 2016 to July 2021, a total of 29,264 kilometres (18,184 mi) of roads, 5,950 bridges, 11,340 flood control projects, 222 evacuation centers, and 150,149 elementary and secondary classrooms, and 653 COVID-19 facilities under the Build, Build, Build program had been completed.\n\nWar on Drugs\nDuterte placed the Philippines' illegal drugs problem at the forefront of his presidential campaign, warning the Philippines was at risk of becoming a narco-state. Upon entering office, Duterte began a nationwide crackdown against illegal drugs. At the forefront of the campaign's operations was Oplan Tokhang, which involved policemen knocking on the doors of suspected drug users and inviting them to surrender. Among Duterte's early actions included naming\nthree Chinese nationals as alleged drug lords in the Philippines, calling for assistance from the New Peoples Army to join the crackdown, and publicly naming 150 public officials allegedly involved in the drug trade.\nConcerns arose worldwide due to the rising death toll during police operations, and drug suspects reportedly fighting back (\"nanlaban\") was a common alibi of several policemen involved. At the height of the drug crackdown in his early presidency, Duterte urged the policemen to kill drug addicts, promising to pardon them for performing their duties; Duterte's call prompted thousands to surrender, and observers noted this assurance may have emboldened the police to allegedly execute suspects and plant evidence on them. In August 2016, opposition Senator Leila de Lima launched a probe into extrajudicial killings, focusing on cases that took place during Duterte's tenure as mayor of Davao City. De Lima presented as witness an alleged member of Davao City-based vigilante group Davao Death Squad, Edgar Matobato, who testified that Duterte was involved in extrajudicial killings in the city. Duterte dismissed the claims as a lie, and the Senate probe was terminated on October 13, 2016, for lack of evidence. Shortly after, Duterte implicated De Lima in the illegal drug trade during her tenure as Justice Secretary under the Aquino III administration. Though De Lima denied the claims, she was later imprisoned in February 2017 due to the drug charges. Two months later, Matobato's lawyer, Jude Josue Sabio, filed charges for crimes against humanity with the International Criminal Court against Duterte and 11 other officials.\nResponding to public clamor, in October 2017, Duterte designated the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency to lead anti-drug operations and temporarily barred the police from joining the raids. Through an executive order he issued in October 2018, Duterte instituted a more balanced approach to the drug problem by establishing the Philippine Anti-Illegal Drugs Strategy, which ordered all government departments and state universities and colleges to implement their own strategies in tackling the country's illegal drug trade; the order also urged local government units, non-government organizations, and private institutions to support and implement the Strategy.\n\nDuterte campaigned to eliminate illegal drugs in the country within three to six months, but later acknowledged he miscalculated the severity of the problem as he based his approach to that of Davao City during his tenure as the city's mayor. Stating it would take him his entire term to eradicate it, he cited the difficulty in border control due to the country's fragmented geography and lamented that several government officials and law enforcers were involved in drug trafficking. Before leaving office, he implored president-elect Bongbong Marcos to continue tackling the illegal drug problem, but declined an appointment offer as Marcos' drug czar, expressing a desire to retire. By the end of Duterte's term, the number of drug suspects killed since Duterte took office was officially tallied by the government as 6,252; human rights groups, however, claim drug casualties reached as high as 12,000 to 30,000. \nVarious international publications and media companies had claimed that Duterte's anti-drugs campaign was a war against the poor due to the abject poverty of those arrested or killed. On June 19, 2018, 38 United Nations member states released a collective statement through the United Nations Human Rights Council, calling on the Philippines and Duterte to end the killings in the war on drugs and cooperate in investigating human rights abuses. Though many human rights note that Duterte's war on drugs was a stain on his legacy, the anti-narcotics drive received domestic approval during his term, and 58% of the country's barangays were declared by the government cleared of illegal drugs by February 2022.\n\nInternational Criminal Court\nIn April 2017, a case was filed by lawyer Jude Sabio before the International Criminal Court (ICC), charging Duterte and 11 other officials with crimes against humanity in relation to the deaths of the controversial war on drugs; in response, outgoing ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda in early 2018 launched a preliminary examination into the charges against the accused. This prompted Duterte in March 2018 to initiate the withdrawal of the Philippines from the ICC, which took effect a year later, on March 17, 2019. Duterte rebuked the idea of allowing foreigners to meddle in the country's justice system and his administration emphasized that cases against him should be filed before the national courts. Additionally, he argued that the Rome Statute, which was ratified by the Senate in 2011, was never binding in the Philippines as it was never published in the Official Gazette, a requirement for a law in the country to take effect. For its part, the ICC reiterated that it maintains jurisdiction over crimes which took place before the withdrawal.\nStating that his 2017 case was an orchestrated move by the Liberal Party, notably Senators Antonio Trillanes and Leila de Lima, to discredit Duterte, Sabio retracted his allegations in January 2020 and requested the ICC to dismiss the case. The ICC rejected Sabio's request and asserted that it \"cannot effectively destroy or return information once it is in its possession or control\". Meanwhile, Duterte's ICC withdrawal was challenged before the Supreme Court by three petitions filed by the Philippine Coalition for the ICC, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, and opposition senators; though the Court in March 2021 ultimately dismissed all three cases on the grounds that the petitioners were unable to establish legal standing to challenge the ICC withdrawal, the Court ruled that the President has no \"unbridled authority\" to withdraw from treaties.\nThe ICC, on September 16, 2021, eventually authorized a formal investigation into the war on drugs in the Philippines, focusing on crimes committed between 2016 and March 2019. In response, the Philippine government in November 2021 requested a deferral of the probe, which was suspended by the ICC to assess the request. Four days before Duterte left office, however, ICC prosecutor Karim Ahmad Khan requested the pre-trial chamber of the ICC to immediately resume the investigation after concluding that the deferral request was \"not warranted\". The succeeding Marcos administration initially declined to allow any ICC probe in the country due to sovereignty issues; however, due to tensions between the Duterte and Marcos political families, the Marcos administration is seen as increasingly open to cooperating with the ICC. Duterte stated he remains unfazed at the threat of arrest, saying he would rather \"die first\" before facing a foreign court. Salvador Panelo, who served as Duterte's chief legal counsel, alleged that Duterte's political opponents were using the ICC as a \"political and propaganda apparatus\".\n\nMindanao insurgency\nDuterte has said that Moro dignity is what the MILF and MNLF are struggling for, and that they are not terrorists. He acknowledged that the Moros were subjected to wrongdoing, historical and in territory.\nDuterte was endorsed in the election by Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) leader Nur Misuari due to his background in Mindanao. Other Muslims also supported Duterte and denounced Roxas, the Aquino-supported pick.\nOn November 6, 2016, Duterte signed an executive order to expand the Bangsamoro Transition Commission to 21 members from 15, in which 11 will be decided by the MILF and 10 will be nominated by the government. The commission was formed in December 2013 and is tasked to draft the Bangsamoro Basic Law in accordance with the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro.\nDuterte signed the Bangsamoro Organic Law on July 26, 2018, which abolished the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and provided for the basic structure of government for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, following the agreements set forth in the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro peace agreement signed between the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in 2014.\nDuterte signed proclamations granting amnesty to members of the Moro National Liberation Front, and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in February 2021.\n\nCampaign against terrorism\nAt the start of 2016, experts warned the Philippines was at risk of having the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) set a foothold in the country. However, Duterte's predecessor, President Aquino III, dismissed the perpetrators of a March 2016 armed attack against the military as mere \"mercenaries\" wanting to join the ISIS. The earliest terrorist attacks in Duterte's presidency occurred in September 2016 in Davao City; November 2016 in Butig, Lanao del Sur; and in April to May 2017 in Inabanga, Bohol, where the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) attempted to establish a position in the Visayas. Though the military eventually quelled the sieges, the events were only a prelude to what would become Duterte's greatest challenge in combating terrorism.\n\nOn May 23, 2017, Duterte was in his first state visit to Russia, where he met Russian president Vladimir Putin to realign the Philippines's foreign policy away from the United States; among his top priorities in the trip included the acquisition of Russian-made munitions to use against Islamic militants in restive Mindanao. At that time, the Philippine military was in an operation to capture ASG leader Isnilon Hapilon. Duterte cut short his trip and flew back to the Philippines after the Maute Group, which pledged allegiance to the ISIS, occupied the city of Marawi in Lanao del Sur. Upon returning, Duterte declared Martial law across Mindanao and ordered a major offensive on the city to retake it. The battle, which lasted for five months, became the country's longest urban warfare; the city, particularly the downtown area, was left in ruins, largely due to militant fire and military airstrikes, necessitating rehabilitation. Hapilon and Omar Maute were eventually killed, and on October 17, Duterte declared the city liberated from terrorist influence.\nCiting the danger posed by Islamic terrorists, Congress, upon Duterte's requests, thrice granted the extension of martial law in Mindanao between 2017 and 2019. The moves drew criticism, particularly from rights groups, who claimed that the extensions were part of a campaign on stifling dissent. By the end of 2019, martial law in Mindanao lapsed, after which Duterte decided not to have it extended. In July 2020, Duterte signed the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, which expanded the powers of the government to address the country's growing security challenges. In its enactment, the law repealed the Human Security Act of 2007, which was described by the 2020 law's proponents as weak and inadequate.: 54–55  However, the 2020 law received intense criticism, notably from the academia and rights groups, for allegedly being prone to abuse; a total of 37 petitions were filed by several groups asking the Supreme Court to have the law nullified,: 60  making the law the most assailed legislation in Philippine history; the Court ultimately upheld the validity of the law in December 2021, but struck two of the law's provisions.\nAs Duterte's term approached its end, the military intensified its efforts against Islamic terrorists, which continued to carry a series of attacks in Mindanao and Sulu; notable among these attacks involved suicide bombing, a tactic not commonly used by Filipino terrorists.: 55  In February 2021, Duterte created the National Amnesty Commission, which would process amnesty applications of former rebels and determine their eligibility. Additionally, he expanded his administration's reintegration program to include former violent extremists. From 2016-2021, 1,544 ASG members, 971 Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters members, and 1,427 Dawlah Islamiyah members were reportedly captured, killed, or surrendered.\n\nCommunist insurgency\nDuterte described himself as left-leaning during his presidential campaign. As he initially had good relations with the left, he received campaign support from leftist groups, particularly in Mindanao. Duterte was a student of Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founder Jose Maria Sison at Lyceum of the Philippines University, and Sison stated during the election campaign that Duterte was \"the best President the Philippines can have since Marcos\".\nUpon Duterte's election into office, prospects of restarting peace talks between the Philippine government and the CPP-NPA-NDF, which stalled in 2011, gained momentum. Duterte temporarily released several communist prisoners, notably couples CPP-NPA chairman Benito and CPP-NPA secretary-general Wilma Tiamzon, to join the peace talks in Oslo. In addition, Duterte offered positions for left-leaning activists in his administration, notably in four executive departments: Agrarian Reform, Environment and Natural Resources, Social Welfare and Development, and Labor and Employment. In the months leading to 2017, however, the Duterte administration and the CPP accused each other of not being faithful to the ongoing peace negotiations. The CPP demanded from the administration the release of around 130 political detainees, which—along proposals of the CPP to form a \"coalition government\"— Duterte declined. Additionally, several leftists appointed by Duterte were rejected by the Commission on Appointments, while others resigned or were fired by Duterte amidst the tense relations. Compounding these were the continued clashes between the military and the NPA and the alternate declaration and lifting of ceasefire amid the ongoing peace talks;\n\nOn February 6, 2017, Duterte, citing continued attacks by the NPA on the military, formally terminated peace negotiations with the CPP-NPA-NDF, designated them as a terrorist organization and ordered the arrest of all NDF negotiators. Through an executive order he issued in December 2018, Duterte established the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC), an inter-agency body that involved a whole-of-nation approach—from the national to local level— in addressing the root causes of communism. The NTF-ELCAC worked in close coordination with the military and focused on developing far-flung localities infiltrated by the NPA. Duterte also granted amnesty to former communist rebels and launched reintegration programs to support them and their families. Ultimately, in March 2019, he permanently terminated peace negotiations with the CPP-NPA-NDF, facilitating localized peace talks with the rebels.\nDuterte left office with the number of NPA guerrilla fronts in the country reduced from 89 to 23, and about 20,579 communist rebels reportedly surrendered from 2016 to 2021. Despite its success in reducing communist insurgency in the country, Duterte's administration was marred by numerous allegations of red-tagging, notably the left-leaning Makabayan Bloc; Duterte and the military dismissed the red-tagging accusations and argued the government was merely \"identifying\" them as communist fronts. Duterte also received criticism after he threatened to order the military in mid-2017 to bomb Lumad schools, which he and the military suspected to shelter rebels and teach subversion. Additionally, the military and the NTF-ELCAC were denounced after they cited clandestine recruitment activities by the communist rebels within university campuses nationwide, notably in both state-run University of the Philippines and Polytechnic University of the Philippines.\nSeveral human rights organizations called on the succeeding Bongbong Marcos administration to abolish the NTF-ELCAC due to continued red-tagging allegations; the calls, however, were rejected by Marcos.\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nWhen news about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread around the world, Duterte initially understated the threat of the disease and urged the public to refrain from inciting anti-Chinese sentiment, which at that time saw a global rise. The first reported COVID-19 case in the Philippines was on January 30, 2020, prompting Duterte to issue bans on the entry of Chinese nationals from China and calling for calm. Duterte changed his tune in March, during which he placed the Philippines under a State of National Calamity and ordered a lockdown in Luzon. His administration opted to use what it described as \"draconian measures\" to control the contagion, and Duterte employed the military and police to enforce the public's strict adherence to quarantine and health protocols.\nAs countries were scrambling in securing COVID-19 vaccines for their own citizens, Duterte called for patience amid criticism. To expedite vaccine procurement, Duterte rejected creating a committee and designated Carlito Galvez Jr. as \"vaccine czar\", who had the gargantuan task of acquiring vaccines from other countries. Additionally, Duterte personally requested vaccines from world leaders, notably Chinese president Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. China and Russia responded favorably, and the Duterte administration started its vaccination program on March 1, 2021, a day after receiving 600,000 CoronaVac vaccines sent by the Chinese government. Duterte also used the US-Philippines Visiting Forces Agreement as leverage in securing vaccines from the United States, threatening to scrap the military pact. In addition, in an apparent effort to help the Philippines gain access to US-developed vaccines, Duterte granted absolute pardon to US soldier Joseph Scott Pemberton, who was serving prison for killing transgender Jennifer Laude in 2014.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic in mid-2021, the Philippines was a COVID-19 hotspot in Asia; vaccine hesitancy was a problem, and many citizens opted to wait for Western vaccines to arrive. In exasperation, Duterte urged the public to undergo vaccination, threatening to arrest unvaccinated individuals and order local leaders to compile a list of defiant residents. In May 2021, to encourage the public that vaccines were safe, Duterte—acting on the advice of his doctor—publicly took the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine before it was approved for use by the Philippine Food and Drug Administration; his move, however, drew criticism since the general public had access to CoronaVac vaccines, which the public majority perceived to have lower efficacy. The backlash prompted Duterte to apologize, acknowledge the possibility of the Sinopharm vaccine's multiple side effects, and decide to pull out the vaccines. The public's prejudice against China's CoronaVac was later revealed in a Reuters 2024 report as the outcome of a US government-launched covert propaganda and disinformation campaign that aimed to erode the public's trust in China-developed vaccines.\nDuterte gradually relaxed quarantine restrictions to revive the economy. Upon leaving office, Duterte's administration secured 245 million vaccine doses; about 70.5 million individuals had been fully vaccinated. Over 3.7 million COVID-19 cases were recorded since the onset of the pandemic, 3.69 million people had recovered from the disease, while 8,706 active cases remained. Though his administration successfully reached its target of vaccinating 70% of the Philippine population, Duterte, along with Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, was implicated in a scandal involving allegedly overpriced medical supplies and equipment. Critics highlighted that Duterte's administration purchased pandemic supplies from Pharmally Pharmaceutical, a company linked to Duterte's former economic adviser, Michael Yang. Duterte rejected the corruption allegations and emphasized that the supplies at the time of purchase were in high demand, hence, the high prices. A Senate probe, headed by Senate Blue Ribbon Committee chairman Richard Gordon, was initiated in August 2021 for alleged irregularities in the use of COVID-19 response funds amounting to ₱67 billion. A month before Duterte left office, Gordon released a draft report on the probe, which claimed that Duterte \"betrayed public trust\" for appointing Yang as economic adviser in 2018, prohibited his Cabinet and other officials from attending the hearings, and allegedly discredited the Senate and Commission on Audit. The report, however, failed to reach the Senate plenary for deliberation after it was signed by nine senators out of the 11 required signatures.\n\nEnergy and climate\nThe Duterte administration initially adopted a \"technology neutral\" policy in energy generation. Earlier in his term, Duterte stressed that coal remains the most viable source of energy if the Philippines is to accelerate industrialization, and questioned the sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union on smaller countries including the Philippines when the country's carbon footprint is not significant compared to the superpowers.\nThe administration shifted its energy policy to prefer renewable sources of energy later in Duterte's term. At his fourth State of the Nation address in July 2019, Duterte issued an order to cut coal dependence and hasten a transition to renewable energy. In October 2020, the energy department issued a moratorium on the construction of new coal power plants and favored renewable energy sources. On February 28, 2022, Duterte issued an executive order approving the inclusion of nuclear power in the country's energy mix.\nTo hasten the expansion of the nation's power capacity, Duterte established the inter-agency Energy Investment Coordinating Council tasked with simplifying and streamlining the approval process of big-ticket projects. On January 21, 2022, he signed a law promoting the use of microgrid systems in unserved and underserved areas to accelerate total electrification of the country. The administration made initiatives to liberalize the energy sector, allowing 100% foreign ownership in large-scale geothermal projects starting October 2020.\nDuterte signed the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in March 2017, after initially having misgivings about the deal which he says might limit the country's industrialization. The Agreement was ratified by the Senate on March 15, 2017. Duterte said that rich countries producing the most carbon emissions must pay smaller countries for damage caused by climate change.\n\nGovernment streamlining\nDuterte introduced reforms to eliminate red tape in the government, and ordered government agencies to remove all processes which are \"redundant or burdensome\" to the public. Three weeks after assuming office, he issued his second executive order establishing Freedom of Information, allowing citizens to obtain documents and records from public offices under the executive branch to promote transparency in the government.\nIn May 2018, Duterte signed the Ease of Doing Business Act which aims to create a better business environment by reducing processing time, cutting bureaucratic red tape, and eliminating corrupt practices in all government agencies. In December 2020, he enacted a law authorizing the President to expedite the processing and issuance of national and local permits, licenses, and certifications, by suspending its requirements, in times of national emergency.\nDuterte institutionalized the 8888 Citizens' Complaint Hotline in October 2016, allowing the public to report complaints on poor government front-line services and corrupt practices in all government agencies.\n\nHealth care\nDuterte vowed to improve the health care system, certifying the Universal Healthcare Bill as an urgent measure as early as July 2018. In February 2019, he signed the Universal Health Care Act, which automatically enrolls all Filipinos under the government's health insurance program. He also enacted the National Integrated Cancer Control Act which establishes a \"national integrated\" program to control and prevent cancer by making treatment more accessible and affordable, and the Philippine Mental Health Law, which provides free mental health services down to the barangay level while requiring hospitals to provide psychiatric, psychosocial and neurologic services.\nIn December 2019, Duterte signed a law institutionalizing Malasakit Centers in all hospitals run by the Department of Health, allowing indigent patients to efficiently access financial medical assistance from various government agencies.\nDuterte ordered the full implementation of the Reproductive Health Law, banned smoking in public places nationwide, and set a price cap on select medicines.\n\nEducation\nDuterte signed the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act in August 2017, providing free college education in all state universities and colleges nationwide. He signed a law establishing transnational higher education in the country, allowing foreign universities to offer degree programs in the Philippines in an effort to bring international quality standards and expertise into the country. He also signed medical scholarships for deserving students in state universities and colleges or partner private higher education institutions through the Doktor Para sa Bayan Act on December 23, 2020.\nDuterte approved in January 2021 a law institutionalizing the alternative learning system (ALS), providing free education to those out of school. In March 2022, he enacted a law granting inclusive education for learners with disabilities.\nOn June 9, 2020, Duterte signed a law establishing the country's first National Academy of Sports in New Clark City, Capas, Tarlac.\n\nForeign policy\nThe Duterte administration has vowed to pursue what it describes as an \"independent foreign policy\" that would reject any meddling by foreign governments, reiterating Article II, Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution which states: \"The State shall pursue an independent foreign policy. In its relations with other states the paramount consideration shall be national sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interest, and the right to self-determination.\" In September 2016, Duterte said: \"We will observe and must insist on the time-honored principle of sovereignty, sovereign equality, non-interference and the commitment of peaceful settlements of dispute that will serve our people and protect the interests of our country.\"\nDuterte made his first international trips as president to Vientiane, Laos and Jakarta, Indonesia on September 5–9, 2016.\nDuterte pursued improved relations with China and Russia, and lessened the country's dependence on its traditional ally – the United States. He has adopted a cautious, pragmatic, and conciliatory stance towards China compared to his predecessor, and has set aside the previous administration's confrontational policy of asserting the Philippines' claims over the South China Sea and its islands.\nMilitant groups decry the ties between President Duterte and China over the Chinese occupation of contested waters and the reported harassment of the fishermen amidst the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Also, while the United States is one of the countries critical to Philippine drug war campaign, most of the militant groups – particularly left-wing groups – also criticize Philippine-US relations due to the United States' \"imperialism\" and neoliberal policies.\n\nAdministration and cabinet\n2022 Philippine presidential election\nInitially stating that he \"sees nobody deserving\" to replace him as the next president, Duterte in August 2021 announced he would run for vice president in the upcoming 2022 national elections, drawing suspicions from critics that he would extend his term. Duterte's political party, the PDP–Laban Cusi faction, named its standard bearer: former Philippine National Police chief and Senator Ronald dela Rosa, who was widely suspected to be a placeholder for Duterte's daughter, Davao City mayor Sara. Duterte later withdrew his candidacy, announced his retirement from politics, and had his long-time aide, Senator Bong Go, substitute him.\nDespite polls showing she was the preferred candidate for presidency, Sara unexpectedly decided to settle for the vice presidential race. This prompted dela Rosa to withdraw his candidacy, which Go would later fill in. Sara's move had Duterte dismayed and he initially retracted his planned retirement, announcing he would run for vice president. Ultimately, he decided not to face his daughter, endorsed a Go-Sara tandem, and declared his intent on running as Senator. In an unexpected turn of events, Sara decided to run in tandem with Bongbong Marcos, who announced his presidential candidacy. Stating his heart and mind contradicted his actions, Go later withdrew his presidential candidacy; shortly after, Duterte officially withdrew his senate bid.\nDue to his high popularity, Duterte remained influential before the national elections as several presidential candidates were open to his endorsement. As the Cusi faction was left without a standard bearer following Go's withdrawal, allies of Duterte endorsed different candidates. The Cusi faction eventually endorsed presidential candidate Marcos and some officials called for Duterte to do the same. Stressing he would remain neutral, Duterte refused to heed their calls and insisted on endorsing only Sara as vice president and 17 senatorial candidates. Additionally, in an effort to protect their integrity, Duterte barred his Cabinet members from campaigning for any candidate. Despite non-endorsement, Duterte hinted on the next president's preferred qualities: decisive, compassionate, a good judge of a person, and preferably, a lawyer; this led a PDP-Laban official to believe Duterte gave a \"virtual endorsement\" for Vice President Leni Robredo, who was Marcos' chief rival in the presidential race. In March 2022, Go said Duterte briefly met with Marcos and gave him advice on the presidency, but could not say whether Duterte gave Marcos an endorsement.\n\nBy May 5, 2022, Duterte created a transition committee led by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea to oversee the transition of power to the next administration. Several analysts believe Duterte had his popularity \"inherited\" by Marcos and Sara, who both won landslides in the election.\n\nImpeachment efforts\nPost-presidency (2022–present)\nAt the end of his presidency, Duterte returned to Davao City and kept a low profile. Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, a political ally of Duterte, convinced him in September 2023 to actively participate in the Philippine political landscape. In January 2023, Duterte resumed hosting his weekly show, Gikan sa Masa, Para sa Masa (From the Masses, For The Masses), on SMNI; co-hosted by Duterte's friend and spiritual adviser Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, Duterte would speak about current political issues besetting the country. Some of Duterte's strong statements in the show, such as his opposition to the expansion of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) sites in the Philippines, attracted attention and were covered by the media.\n\n2023 visit to China\nIn July 2023, amid escalating tensions in the South China Sea, Chinese President Xi Jinping invited Duterte to Beijing. During the meeting, Xi asked Duterte to \"play an important role\" in improving Philippine-China relations, which were rapidly deteriorating under the Marcos administration that sought to gravitate towards the United States by expanding the number of bases American troops can access under the EDCA. As the meeting did not involve the Marcos administration, the event gained much attention, and the administration wanted details of the Xi-Duterte discussion. Duterte visited Malacanang Palace later and, in a closed-door session, discussed the matter with Marcos, though no further details were provided to the media.\n\nFeud with the House and Marcos-Duterte rift\nA rift between the Duterte and Marcos families had begun under House Speaker Martin Romualdez' leadership. In the House of Representatives, unconfirmed reports of Deputy House Speaker Gloria-Macapagal Arroyo allegedly attempting to unseat Romualdez as House Speaker circulated. Despite Arroyo dismissing the accusations, Arroyo was later demoted by the House from her senior deputy Speaker position.\nDuterte's daughter, Vice President and Education Secretary Sara, subsequently resigned from the Romualdez-led Lakas-CMD and, in a veiled reference to Romualdez, called him a \"tambaloslos\". In October 2023, Sara requested Congress for the allocation of confidential funds for the office of the vice president (OVP) and the education department which can be used for the Reserve Officers' Training Corps program. Her requests came under intense scrutiny by the Senate and also the House, which was dominated by Romualdez' allies. Congress ultimately rejected her appeals while swiftly approving the confidential funds of the Office of the President; Sara eventually dropped her requests, reasoning that the move was being \"divisive\".\nIn the aftermath of events, Duterte criticized the House for denying his daughter's confidential funds; alleging a collusion between Romualdez and the left-wing Makabayan bloc, he demanded an audit of the House under Romualdez. Duterte's comments offended some House members including Romualdez, prompting the House to issue a loyalty check resolution in support of Romualdez; Duterte's political allies, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Congressman Isidro Ungab, were later expelled by the House from their Deputy House Speaker positions for failing to sign the House resolution. Several House members also pledged support for Romualdez, including a majority of members of Duterte's political party, PDP-Laban, who switched parties mostly to the Romualdez-led Lakas-CMD. After ACT Teachers Representative France Castro of the Makabayan Bloc pushed to remove the OVP and education department's confidential funds, Duterte urged Sara to reveal the use of such funds, which included the supposed killing of communists such as Castro. In response, Castro filed a legal case against Duterte for labeling her as a communist rebel and allegedly threatening her life; Castro's legal case was later denied by the Quezon City Prosecutor’s Office due to insufficient evidence.\n\nSMNI suspension and ICC investigation\nDespite sustained domestic popularity, Duterte found himself increasingly politically isolated. SMNI, which hosted his talk show Gikan sa Masa, Para sa Masa, was later suspended (first for 30 days, and later indefinitely) by the National Telecommunications Commission on grounds of alleged dissemination of fake information. Gikan was also suspended after ACT Teachers Representative France Castro filed a complaint against Duterte for allegedly threatening her life during one of the shows. Duterte initially intended to speak to Marcos about the SMNI suspension issue as it has affected his talk show, decrying the suspension as censorship. Additionally, the Liberal Party, who opposed Marcos' 2022 presidential campaign, were increasingly silent in criticizing the Marcos administration, instead, directing criticism at Duterte and his daughter, Vice President Sara. Duterte and his former aide, Senator Bong Go, also faced alleged plunder charges initiated in July 2024 by Duterte's staunch critic, former Senator Antonio Trillanes.\nThe Marcos administration also was seen as altering its stance, albeit discreetly, on controversial issues hounding Duterte. Despite Marcos' early assurance of the Philippines' non-cooperation on the looming International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation on Duterte's war on drugs, conflicting statements and moves by House Speaker Romualdez, the House, Marcos' Justice Secretary Crispin Remulla and Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra muddled the administration's official stance. In addition, Marcos limited his position on the matter through oral statements and avoided issuing an executive order formalizing his stance. There were also unconfirmed reports, including by former Senator Antonio Trillanes, stating that ICC members had already entered the Philippines and were already secretly conducting the investigation. A House probe initiated in April 2024 by Romualdez into a \"status quo\" agreement in the South China Sea Duterte made during his presidency with Chinese president Xi Jinping was also seen as a \"political payback\" to Duterte's verbal attacks on Marcos and diminish Duterte's political influence ahead of the 2025 midterm elections. Amidst growing isolation, Duterte found allies who were previously loyal to Marcos. Among them were Marcos' longtime lawyer, Vic Rodriguez, who served as executive secretary in Marcos' first 79 days before resigning; and Marcos' sister, Senator Imee Marcos.\n\nQuiboloy's arrest order and Duterte as KOJC administrator\nOn March 9, 2024, Duterte's longtime friend and Kingdom of Jesus Christ leader, Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, was ordered arrested by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation after his conviction by a US District Court for alleged cases of sex trafficking, rape, fraud, and cash smuggling. No extradition request was received by the Marcos administration for Quiboloy's arrest, although a probe in the Senate was previously initiated on January 23 by Liberal Party ally, Senator Risa Hontiveros, who invited Quiboloy to attend the hearings. Quiboloy demanded a fair trial as a requirement to attend, though this was rebuked by Hontiveros and Marcos. Claiming his life was under threat through what he described as a connivance between Marcos and the US government, Quiboloy went into hiding and designated Duterte as administrator of his ministry's properties. After Quiboloy refused to attend the hearings, Hontiveros cited him in contempt and recommended the Senate President to order his arrest. Arrest orders for Quiboloy were issued by the Pasig Regional Trial Court despite the efforts of Senators Robin Padilla, Cynthia Villar, and Bong Go to oppose the move. Four separate raids were eventually held in Quiboloy's properties in Davao City; though Quiboloy was not found, the raids were criticized by Duterte and his allies for its \"excessive [and] unnecessary force\" involving several units of police and military personnel \"in full battle gear\". KOJC members gathered in a rally in Liwasang Bonifacio calling for justice for Quiboloy.\n\n\"Hakbang ng Maisug\" rallies\nAdditional nationwide protests, called Hakbang ng Maisug (brave) prayer rallies, were held in Dumaguete, Tagum, and Angeles by Duterte and Quiboloy's supporters, who voiced their grievances against the Marcos administration. Particularly among these grievances included their opposition to proposed constitutional amendments and to the increased US military presence in the country, as well as denouncement of perceived censorship under the administration. In one of the rallies, Duterte notably accused Marcos of plotting to extend his term beyond the current term limit of the Constitution and of being a drug addict, to which Marcos responded by alleging Duterte's previous use of fentanyl as painkiller impaired his judgment; Duterte later dared Marcos to undergo a drug test with him at Luneta Park.\nFrustrated on the administration's use of taxpayers' money, Duterte initially revived calls advocated by former House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez for Mindanao to secede from the Philippines; his calls drew disapproval from several lawmakers and former Muslim rebels, prompting Duterte to later retract his calls, saying he only wanted  \"a better deal for Mindanao\". Despite success in holding some rallies, a few suffered setbacks and cancellations after the rally venues were allegedly blocked by the Marcos administration, drawing condemnation from Duterte and his allies. Despite his criticisms against Marcos, Duterte clarified the prayer rallies were not meant to overthrow the administration but warned Marcos of extending his six-year term, reminding Marcos of his father's fate.\n\n2025 elections\nOn October 5, 2024, Duterte announced that he will run for mayor of Davao City, with his son, incumbent Mayor Sebastian Duterte, as his running mate for vice mayor in 2025. He also rejected calls for him to run for senator, citing his old age. He officially filed his candidacy on October 7. He is the second former president to run for mayor after leaving office, after Joseph Estrada.\n\nPublic image\nArdent supporters of Duterte have been labeled as \"Diehard Duterte Supporters\", alternatively known as \"Digong Duterte Supporters\", which shares the acronym with the Davao Death Squad (DDS). This label has been applied to the 16 million people who voted for him in the 2016 presidential election.\nDuterte developed a reputation as a \"protector\" and \"savior\" in his hometown of Davao City as mayor of the city for more than two decades. This is despite reports of death squads in the city.\n\nDuterte has been described as a populist, with his foul-mouthed remarks against the country's elite which positioned him as a \"man of the people\" and was critical to his victory in the 2016 presidential election. He has also been compared to U.S. President Donald Trump for his rhetorical style.\nDuterte and his administration have been criticized for his anti-drug campaign, foreign policies, human rights record, extrajudicial killings during his term, political views, and controversial comments. Despite the criticisms on his administration, throughout his career, Duterte's remained hugely popular, attributed to his man-of-the-people style and a perception of strong leadership and success in fighting crime and corruption, while opponents reproach him for his authoritarian style and low tolerance of dissent. Analysts attribute his continued popularity to his emotional connection to the public, citing his charisma and humor, tough-talking manner, his image as a father figure as Tatay Digong (Father Digong), and Filipinos' general interest in strong leaders.\nA Social Weather Stations study concluded that there are multiple reasons for Duterte's high satisfaction ratings in surveys; these include his strong base support, satisfaction with the administration's overall governance (pamamalakad) and with some policy issues which include helping the poor and the drug war, and his character. Poll respondents who relate to or are attracted to some aspects of his character, such as his perceived decisiveness and diligence tend to be satisfied. On the other hand, those who feel he is vulgar (bastos) tend to be less satisfied.\nDespite keeping a low profile during his post-presidency, Duterte retained his popularity, topping four consecutive surveys conducted separately in March, June, September, and December 2023 by PUBLiCUS Asia on the voting disposition for 2025 Philippine Senate election.\n\nControversial remarks and human rights concerns\nDuterte's record on human rights and his long history of comments that have widely been considered to be offensive, provocative, threatening, and undiplomatic have received sharp international criticism. He has been portrayed by his critics in the media as having a \"dirty mouth\". He had, however, promised to behave in a \"prim and proper\" manner on the national and international stage once he was to be inaugurated as president, to the point that, \"almost, I would become holy.\"\nThroughout his presidency, Duterte has made controversial comments about rape, human rights, his views on media killings, and has used slurs; he has also made controversial statements to international leaders and institutions. He has also repeatedly criticized the Catholic Church which has expressed alarm over deaths linked to the war on drugs.\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) called the first year of Duterte in office a \"human rights calamity\". HRW estimates that there has been 7,000 deaths from the day Duterte first took office to January 2017. The Duterte administration suspended the drug war in February 2017 in an effort to cleanse the police ranks of supposed corruption, also halting the disclosure of figures on deaths related to drug arrests and raids. In March 2017, HRW released a special investigation and report on the state of police related shooting, titled \"License To Kill\". The New York Times had also released a video documentary \"When A President Says I'll Kill You\", which depicts Duterte's war on drugs through a local photographer's eyes. On August 17, 2017, HRW called Duterte a threat to the human rights community after he made threats against human rights activists.\n\nSupporters\nSeveral other Facebook groups with the acronym \"DDS\" supported Duterte as early as 2011. Among these groups is the Duterte Defense Squad, which was created on July 5, 2011. Other examples include Digong Duterte Supporters-Registered Nurses Group, Duterte's Destiny is to Serve the Country, Digong Duterte Swerte (lit. Digong Duterte is (Good) Luck), and Davsur Duterte Supporters. In 2015, members of the various groups urged Duterte to run for president.\n\nApproval ratings\nDespite criticism and international opposition to his controversial anti-narcotics drive, Duterte's domestic approval rating remained relatively high throughout his presidency. Duterte began his presidency with a high trust rating of 79% and 91% (the highest of any Philippine official since 1999), from pollsters Social Weather Stations (SWS) and Pulse Asia, respectively. His net satisfaction rating plunged to its lowest at 45% in July 2018, attributed to inflation during the period as well as Duterte calling God \"stupid\" for the concept of original sin in the Bible; eventually, his satisfaction rating rose to 60% by the end of the year.\nHalfway through his term, Duterte's approval rating reached 79%, the highest among his predecessors at this stage in their presidencies. It rose to 87% by the end of 2019 due to the successful hosting of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games as well as the administration's poverty reduction programs. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Pulse Asia reported in September 2020 that 84% of Filipinos approved of the administration's efforts to contain the virus and provide assistance to those who lost their jobs; 92% of the poll respondents also agreed Duterte had \"done well\" in preventing the contagion in the country. Duterte ended 2021 with an approval rating of 60%, wherein higher net satisfaction was observed among those who have been or are willing to get vaccinated.\nDuterte maintained his high approval and trust ratings as he approached the end of his term. A 2021 poll by WR Numero Research revealed that 54.59% of voters want soft continuity of Duterte's policies, 29.57% want full continuity, while only 15.84% preferred change. Duterte left office with a net satisfaction rating of 81%, his highest in SWS polling. Additionally, polling firm PUBLiCUS Asia reported in Duterte's last month in office that Duterte received a 75% approval for his entire six-year tenure, making him the most popular post-EDSA president.\n\nPolitical views\nDuterte described himself as left-leaning during his campaign and presidency, but has stressed that he is for democracy and is not a communist.\nDuterte was a member of the leftist Kabataang Makabayan during the 1970s and was a student of prominent Philippine leftist figure and founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines, Jose Maria Sison. However, his relationship with the communists deteriorated during his presidency due to continued rebel attacks on soldiers despite the peace talks.\n\nPersonal life\nDuterte is known for being an avid fan of big bikes, but detests luxury cars. He once owned a second-hand Harley-Davidson and a Yamaha Virago. He was once a habitual smoker, but he eventually quit after a doctor's suggestion due to health concerns. Duterte is an avid reader of Robert Ludlum and Sidney Sheldon novels. Duterte is also known for his straightforward and vocal attitude in public, especially in interviews, showing no hesitation in profusely using profanity live on-screen on numerous occasions despite formal requests by media groups and schools beforehand to abstain.\nDuterte has his own local show in Davao City called Gikan sa Masa, para sa Masa (\"From the Masses, For the Masses\"), which formerly aired as a blocktimer on ABS-CBN Davao, and currently broadcast on SMNI News Channel since 2023. He is also a member of Lex Talionis Fraternitas, a fraternity based in the San Beda College of Law and the Ateneo de Davao University.\nAside from his native Cebuano, Duterte is also fluent in Filipino and English.\nWhile criticizing political opponent Antonio Trillanes in a 2019 speech, Duterte said that he was once gay but had \"cured himself\" before meeting his partner Elizabeth Zimmerman.\nSince being the mayor of Davao City, Duterte has held an annual tradition of visiting children with cancer in the city and giving them Christmas gifts.\n\nFamily\nDuterte's father, Vicente, died in 1968 while his mother, Soledad, died on February 4, 2012, at the age of 95. His first wife Elizabeth was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer in 2015.\nIn 1973, Duterte married Elizabeth Zimmerman, a flight attendant of German American descent. She traces her roots in Tuburan, Cebu. They have three children (from eldest to youngest): Paolo (\"Pulong\"), Sara (\"Inday Sara\") and Sebastian (\"Baste\"). Paolo and Inday Sara both became lawyers and entered politics while Baste, with no interest in politics, concentrated on business and surfing but eventually ran and won as vice mayor of Davao City in 2019. Sara was elected as Vice President in 2022.\nDuterte has been publicly open about his infidelity while married to Zimmerman and cited it as the reason for his failed marriage. In 1998, Zimmerman filed a petition in the Regional Trial Court of Pasig to nullify her marriage. Duterte never appeared in court and did not contest Zimmerman's petition. Two years later, the court decided in her favor, ending the 27-year marriage of Duterte and Zimmerman. Duterte and Zimmerman have been on good terms in recent years, with Zimmerman stating: \"Yes, [Rodrigo] is really a very good leader. That is all he is. But when it comes to family, he is not capable of taking care of it.\"\nIn 2001, Zimmerman eventually ran for a seat on the City Council but lost. Duterte and Zimmerman patched things up and are civil to each other years after their marriage was annulled. Zimmerman eventually joined the campaign trail for Duterte's presidential candidacy in 2016 called Byaheng Du30, in which she would travel by bus to major cities together with her daughter Sara and a number of delegates.\nDuterte is currently living with his common-law wife Cielito \"Honeylet\" Avanceña, a former nurse, with whom he has one daughter named Veronica (\"Kitty\"). Duterte has eleven grandchildren, half of whom are Muslims and the other half Christian, and two great-grandchildren.\nOn his paternal side, Duterte shares familial ties with some of the prominent families of the Visayas, particularly the Almendrases and Duranos of Danao, Cebu. His distant uncle, former Senator Alejandro Almendras, was one of his original supporters when he first ran for mayor of Davao City in 1988.\n\nReligion\nDespite being raised as a communicant of the Catholic Church, on January 19, 2016, Duterte clarified that he had not attended Mass for quite some time already since he deemed it incompatible with his mayoral responsibilities: \"If I listened to the Ten Commandments or to the priests,\" said Duterte, \"I would not be able to do anything as a mayor.\" Duterte has described himself as Christian in 2016 and \"spiritual\" in 2018, expressing that he \"can't accept\" Catholicism or organized religion but also that he is neither an atheist nor an agnostic. He has referred to God as Allah and has been quoted as saying: \"a part of me which is Islam\".\nDuring his presidency, Duterte and the Catholic Church in the Philippines exchanged frequent criticisms. In response to the rising death toll in Duterte's war on drugs, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) in February 2017 issued a strongly-worded pastoral letter which was read in church services; the letter highlighted that \"[killing] is considered as normal\", and \"to consent and keep silent in front of evil is to be an accomplice to it\". Duterte later lambasted Catholic bishops, telling them \"not use the pulpit\", reviling them as \"sons of bitches\", remarking that some of them are gay, and urging street bums to rob and kill them. Notable among the bishops Duterte criticized was Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David, a vocal critic of the Duterte administration's war on drugs. Duterte accused David of being involved in illegal drugs and stealing church donations, after which the CBCP came to David's defense and vouched for his integrity. Citing continued criticism from Catholic bishops, Duterte's verbal attacks on the Catholic Church escalated in mid-2018 to early 2019, during which he challenged the Catholic Church to show evidence of the existence of God, while expressing his belief in \"one Supreme God\" and \"a universal mind somewhere which controls the universe\". In one of his harshest vitriol in June 2018, he remarked that God was \"stupid\" for permitting the serpent to tempt Eve in the creation story in the Bible; though the controversial statement was later clarified by his spokesperson as Duterte's \"personal opinion\", it contributed to Duterte's quarterly approval rating dipping to its lowest at 45%. Efforts by the Church to rally public support against the administration's war on drugs, however, were less effective due to Duterte's domestic popularity and high trust ratings.\nDuterte considers his close friend, pastor Apollo Quiboloy of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KJC), as his spiritual adviser. Duterte would become estate administrator of the properties KJC in March 2024, following Senate inquiries launched against the church and Quiboloy.\nIn his post-presidency in January 2024, Duterte visited the wake of CBCP president Fernando Capalla in Davao Cathedral, during which he stated he attends Masses thrice every Sunday; he further added \"I am a very holy man. I'm a whole human being now\".\n\nHealth\nDuterte has Buerger's disease, an inflammation of blood vessels, mostly in the limbs, and Barrett's esophagus, wherein esophageal cells are gradually replaced by gastrointestinal cells. He has denied rumors of throat cancer.\nDuterte admitted in December 2016 that he had been a user of the addictive opioid drug Fentanyl. He said that a doctor prescribed the drug to alleviate back pain and headaches, but that he would take more than he was prescribed. Duterte later denied that he was a drug addict, and a spokesman stated that he was not affected by side-effects of the drug, which include confusion, anxiety and hallucinations.\nDuterte has boasted about his use of Viagra: \"When I was young, I could do overnight, which is more expensive. When I got old, I could do short time only because I have such a short time left. After one erection, that's it. No more. Without Viagra, it's even more difficult.\"\nA psychological assessment of Duterte was commissioned by a doctor named Natividad Dayan during Duterte's marriage annulment to Elizabeth Zimmerman in July 1998. The result was that Duterte (then Davao City mayor) was found to have \"antisocial narcissistic personality disorder\", exemplified by \"gross indifference, insensitivity and self-centeredness\", and a \"grandiose sense of self-entitlement and manipulative behaviours\". According to the assessment, he had a \"pervasive tendency to demean, humiliate others and violate their rights and feelings\", and was \"unable to reflect on the consequences of his actions.\"\nIn a speech to the Filipino community in Russia, Duterte revealed that he has myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disease, which makes his eye droop.\n\nHonors and awards\nDuterte declined an honorary doctor of laws degree offered by the University of the Philippines amid opposition from members of the university. On March 28, 2023, the Davao City Council passed a resolution declaring every March 28—Duterte's birthday—as \"Duterte Day\" in recognition for the \"great and continuing contribution\" of Duterte to the city and the Philippines. Duterte received an honorary Juris Doctor degree from his alma mater, San Beda College of Law, in November 2023.\n\nNational honors\nKnight Grand Cross of Rizal (KGCR) – (2017)\nAwards for Promoting Philippines-China Understanding (APPCU), Hall of Fame – (2023)\n\nForeign honors\nDuterte was conferred an honorary doctorate degree for international relations or foreign diplomacy from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations on October 5, 2019.\n\n Malaysia\n Johor: Grand Knight of The Most Esteemed Order of Sultan Ibrahim of Johor, 1st Class (SMIJ) – Dato' (2019)\n Brunei\nSultan of Brunei Golden Jubilee Medal – (2017)\n\nSee also\nList of presidents of the Philippines\nList of presidents of the Philippines by previous executive experience\nPolitical positions of Rodrigo Duterte\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nJuego, Bonn (2017). \"The Philippines 2017: Duterte-led authoritarian populism and its liberal-democratic roots\" (PDF).

        "content": "Aoharu × Machinegun (Japanese: 青春×機関銃, Hepburn: Aoharu × Kikanjū) is a Japanese manga series by Naoe, serialized in Gangan Comics' shōnen manga magazine Monthly GFantasy from January 2013 to August 2019 and collected in eighteen tankōbon volumes. An anime television series adaptation was announced and aired from July 3 to September 18, 2015.\n\nCharacters\nToy Gun Gun\nHotaru Tachibana (立花 蛍, Tachibana Hotaru)\nVoiced by: Mikako Komatsu (Japanese); Monica Rial (English)\nHotaru is the Student Council President of her high school and is known for her brute strength, good reflexes, and a strong sense of justice. She claims to not let \"evil doers\" get away with their evil deeds, and is often noted to enjoy picking fights for the sake of what's right. Early examples include her beating up a student who was extorting money from a helpless classmate, and desiring revenge after learning that her best friend, Kanae, was conned by a Host (later going after said host on her quest for justice). She is often mistaken as male due to her appearance. She is next door neighbors with Masamune. Hotaru uses illeism, referring to herself as \"Tachibana\".\n\nMasamune Matsuoka (松岡 正宗, Matsuoka Masamune)\nVoiced by: Tomoaki Maeno (Japanese); Corey Hartzog (English)\nMasamune works as a Host, and is responsible for introducing Hotaru to the world of \"Survival Games\". He, together with his childhood friend, Tooru, form an alliance called the \"Toy ☆ Gun Gun Team\". He is unaware of the fact that Hotaru is actually female. To repay the damages caused by Hotaru to the club at which he works at, he offers her the chance to become a member of his team. Because of his past, he has abandonment issues, which later cause him to kick Hotaru out of the team, fearing she will leave him like his former friends/teammates and mother did. However, after Hotaru helps him face his past through a one-on-one challenge, he lets her rejoin. After Hotaru rejoins the team he develops feelings for her, but struggles with them as he does not know that Hotaru is female. There was a moment in his past where, after being abandoned by his mother, he grew suicidal. Nagamasa introduced him to survival games to convince him to live on.\n\nTōru Yukimura (雪村 透, Yukimura Tōru)\nVoiced by: Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Japanese); Chris Patton (English)\nTooru is a manga artist who specializes in erotic comics. He is Masamune's childhood friend, both of them having shared the same dream of pursuing soccer as a career when they were young. He lives in the same apartment block as his teammates. Due to his past, when he was betrayed by friends he trusted, he has low self-confidence and often worries that Masamune might abandon him. He is also the most sensitive to others, being the first one to notice changes in the member's moods.\n\nHaruki Hosokawa (細川 春樹, Hosokawa Haruki)\nHaruki was the third member of Toy Gun Gun before Hotaru, who blamed Masamune for making him hate survival games. In truth, Haruki was overwhelmed by his younger twin brother Haruka during TGC and left the team because he felt that he wasn't strong enough. He intended to return to the team after he had trained significantly, but was surprised to hear that Hotaru had filled his spot. Although first antagonistic towards Hotaru, he eventually warms up to her and was brought back into the team as their fourth member. Haruki is also the first one of the team to find out that Hotaru is female. He wears a gas mask during his games.\n\nHoshishiro\nNagamasa Midori (緑 永将, Midori Nagamasa)\nVoiced by: Kazuyuki Okitsu (Japanese); Greg Ayres (English)\nNagamasa is the leader of the survival game team Hoshishiro, which is the name of the hospital he works as a doctor at along with his teammates Fujimon and Ichi. He initially appears to be a very kind man, but he is the object of Tooru and Masamune's resentment due to what took place in the past. It is revealed that he beat up two former Toy Gun Gun players, but it was all within the rules of TGC. He and Masamune used to be close partners, but after being told by another survival game player that Masamune was also a strong vanguard, Nagamasa was convinced to end their partnership. Although brutal during survival games, Nagamasa is known to show kindness outside of it. He knows that Hotaru is a girl but kept a secret though it ended being a blackmail for Hotaru.\n\nTakatora Fujimoto (藤本 高虎, Fujimoto Takatora)\nVoiced by: Ryōhei Kimura (Japanese); Scott Gibbs (English)\nNicknamed Fujimon, he is a member of Hoshishiro and works at hospital alongside the rest of his teammates. He fights using a minigun and can move fast despite the weight of his weapon. Due to his earnest and easy-going personality, he gets along well with Hotaru and often expresses concern for the Toy Gun Gun members.\n\nIchi Akabane (赤羽 市, Akabane Ichi)\nVoiced by: Eri Kitamura (Japanese); Allison Sumrall (English)\nIchi is Hoshishiro's sniper. She appears to work as a nurse in the same hospital with Nagamasa and Takatora. She is the newest member of the team, brought in after Haruka's departure. As such she is unaware of the team's history, nor of Nagamasa's past with Masamune.\n\nHaruka Hosokawa (細川 春花, Hosokawa Haruka)\nHaruka is Haruki's younger twin brother, who was the original third member of Hoshishiro until Haruki stopped playing survival games. Haruka has an obsession with his brother, and feels guilty for being the reason why Haruki quit survival games. He eventually returns to Hoshishiro, but unlike the other members of the team he expresses distrust for Nagamasa, finding it difficult to tell what he's planning. He hates when other people call his brother 'Haruharu'.\n\nOthers\nHanako Sagara (相楽 華子, Sagara Hanako)\nVoiced by: Kana Ueda (Japanese); Allison Keith-Shipp (English)\nHanako is a close friend of Masamune. During a practice match, Hotaru temporarily becomes a member of her team and she instructs her to observe how the game is played.\n\nKanae Yajima (矢島 鼎, Yajima Kanae)\nVoiced by: Yui Horie (Japanese); Shenae'a Moore (English)\nKanae is Hotaru's friend, and is the only one who knows of Hotaru being a girl (besides Haruki and Nagamasa, who find out later).\n\nMedia\nManga\nAoharu × Machinegun is written and illustrated by Naoe. It started serialization in Square Enix's shōnen manga magazine Monthly GFantasy as a one-shot, on June 18, 2012, and later as a full-fledged series, on January 18, 2013. The manga ended on August 18, 2019. Eighteen tankōbon volumes were released.\n\nAnime\nAn anime television series adaptation produced by Brain's Base and directed by Hideaki Nakano premiered on July 2, 2015, at TBS. It also aired at CBC at the same date and at MBS, TUT, and BS-TBS at later dates. The anime is licensed by AnimeLab in Australia and New Zealand and streamed it on their website as it aired in Japan. The anime has also been licensed in North America by Sentai Filmworks.\n\nReception\nAnime News Network (ANN) had three editors review the first episode of the anime: Theron Martin found interest in the relationship dynamic between Hotaru and Masamune, a potential exploration of gender identity, and gave credit to the show's technical aesthetics despite lacking in palpable comedic moments; Nick Creamer was drawn in by the characterization of Hotaru but found criticism in the direction of both the plot and animation as feeling mediocre and typical of its given genre. The third reviewer, Rebecca Silverman, found the episode to be one of weakest debuts of its given season, criticizing the character of Hotaru and the storytelling she's placed in, and the middling production that's accessory to the delivery. Silverman said that: \"If you're really into survival game shows and find mistaken gender hilarious, there might be more here for you than I found, but I'm also sure that there are better versions of both stories to be found elsewhere\". Fellow ANN editor Gabriella Ekens reviewed the complete anime series in 2016. She commended the \"fairly realistic depiction\" of airsoft towards a female demographic and the initial character setup of Hotaru and Midori, but found the series overall unspectacular with its half-hearted delivery of both shōnen-ai and shōjo elements simultaneously, unfinished plot and an \"irritating and hyperactive\" English dub with only Greg Ayres' portrayal of Midori as the highlight, concluding that: \"Although it contains some sparks of promise with a few characters who aren't entirely stereotypes, Aoharu x Machinegun is ultimately my least favorite type of show – boring, incomplete, and made for practically nobody. Skip.\"\n\nSee also\nTokyo Aliens, another manga series by the same author\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website (in Japanese)\nAnime official website (in Japanese)\nAoharu × Machinegun (anime) at Anime News Network's encyclopedia"

At 534 and 511 career home runs respectively, they are the only men to crack the 500-homer mark—apart from Babe Ruth and his legendary 714 blows.\n\nFebruary\nFebruary 5 –  California governor Earl Warren dispels the rumor that he is a candidate for the position of Commissioner of Baseball.\n\nMarch\nMarch 10 – The owners of the St. Louis Browns reveal plans to mortgage Sportsman's Park and a minor-league facility in San Antonio, Texas, to raise $600,000 to pay off debts, amid rumors the American League club may be sold and moved elsewhere.\nMarch 12 –  For a second time in three months, Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler loses his bid for a new contract when he fails to secure the required support of 12 of the 16 MLB owners. The final tally is nine for Chandler, seven against. The former U.S. Senator, who became baseball's second permanent \"czar\" in April 1945, will serve as \"lame duck\" comissioner until he steps down July 15.\nMarch 21 – During spring training, Pittsburgh Pirates left-handed-throwing first baseman Dale Long appears as a catcher in an exhibition game at San Diego, after Pirates general manager Branch Rickey decides to flout tradition. The experiment goes nowhere, with Long appearing almost exclusively as a pinch hitter and playing seven innings at first base before he's sent the St. Louis Browns on waivers June 1. Long eventually catches catch two innings in 1958 as a member of the Chicago Cubs, using his first baseman's mitt.\n\nApril\nApril 1 – The Cleveland Indians trade third baseman Fred Marsh and $35,000 to the St. Louis Browns for second baseman Snuffy Stirnweiss and shortstop Merl Combs.\nApril 17\nNineteen-year-old rookie Mickey Mantle makes his MLB debut playing right field and batting third for the New York Yankees in The Bronx against the Boston Red Sox. His sixth-inning single off Bill Wight produces his first-ever hit, RBI and run scored. The Yanks shut out Boston 5–0 behind Vic Raschi.\nAt Shibe Park, the Philadelphia Athletics and the Washington Senators play the first Opening Day night game in American League history. The Senators prevail, 6–1, behind the solid pitching of Cuban 40-year-old Connie Marrero, as his batterymate Mickey Grasso hits a three-run home run. Marrero pitches nine strong innings, allowing one earned run on seven hits and two walks while striking out six batters. Bobby Shantz is the losing pitcher.\nApril 23 – In 16 innings, the Brooklyn Dodgers edge the Boston Braves at Ebbets Field, 2–1.\nApril 30 – Three American League clubs combine on a trade, in which the Chicago White Sox obtain future Baseball Hall of Famer Minnie Miñoso from the Cleveland Indians and fellow outfielder Paul Lehner from the Philadelphia Athletics. Simultaneously, the ChiSox send catcher Gus Niarhos and outfielder Dave Philley to Philadelphia, and the Indians obtain pitcher Lou Brissie from the Athletics in exchange for pitcher Sam Zoldak and catcher Ray Murray.\n\nMay\nMay 1 – On Mother's Day, New York Yankees rookie Mickey Mantle hits the first home run of his MLB career off Randy Gumpert in an 8–3 victory over the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park. In the same game, Cuban third baseman and former Negro leagues star Minnie Miñoso becomes the first black player in White Sox franchise history. In his first MLB at-bat, Miñoso homers off Yankees' starter Vic Raschi.\nMay 6 – In the second game of a doubleheader at Braves Field, Cliff Chambers pitches a no-hitter, as the Pittsburgh Pirates top the Boston Braves, 3–0.\nMay 10 – The Cleveland Indians obtain veteran outfielder Sam Chapman from the Philadelphia Athletics for infielder Lou Klein and outfielder Allie Clark.\nMay 14 – The New York Yankees trade third baseman Billy Johnson to the St. Louis Cardinals for first baseman Don Bollweg and $15,000. Johnson, 32, has won four World Series rings as a Yankee since 1943.\nMay 15 – The Detroit Tigers trade right-hander Saul Rogovin to the Chicago White Sox for southpaw Bob Cain. On August 19, 1951, Cain will be on the mound at Sportsman's Park during Bill Veeck's most famous promotional stunt.\nMay 16 – The contract of third baseman Bob Dillinger, a speedy .300 hitter and former American League All-Star notorious for lackadaisical play in the field, is sold to the Chicago White Sox by the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nMay 17\nThe Boston Red Sox trade pitchers Jim Suchecki and Jim McDonald (\"player to be named later\"/PTBNL), catcher Matt Batts and $100,000 to the St. Louis Browns for catcher Les Moss.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates trade shortstop Stan Rojek to the St. Louis Cardinals for first baseman Rocky Nelson and outfielder/infielder/pitcher Erv Dusak.\nMay 28 – After starting his MLB career 0-for-12, rookie New York Giants outfielder Willie Mays gets his first major league hit, a home run off Boston Braves ace Warren Spahn at the Polo Grounds.\nMay 30 – On Memorial Day, the Chicago White Sox sweep the St. Louis Browns in a Comiskey Park doubleheader, 5–2 and 8–1, to extend their winning streak to 14 games dating to May 15. Under first-year manager Paul Richards, the ChiSox are the early surprises of the American League, ending today with a 26–9 (.743) record and a two-game lead over the New York Yankees in the early-season pennant race. In contrast, the 1950 Pale Hose had gone 60–94 and finished sixth.\n\nJune\nJune 4\nGus Bell of the Pittsburgh Pirates hits for the cycle, drives in three runs and scores two more, to lead Pittsburgh to a 12–4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies at Shibe Park.\nFrank Lane, the prolific trade-maker and general manager of the Chicago White Sox, makes two deals. First, he acquires infielder Kermit Wahl from the Philadelphia Athletics for third baseman Hank Majeski, then he packages Wahl, outfielder Paul Lehner and cash to obtain outfielder Don Lenhardt from the St. Louis Browns.\nJune 15\nAt the trading deadline, the Brooklyn Dodgers—already six games in front in the National League standings—get even stronger, acquiring slugging outfielder Andy Pafko from the Chicago Cubs in an eight-player trade. The full transaction sees Brooklyn get five-time All-Star Pafko, pitcher Johnny Schmitz, catcher Rube Walker and infielder Wayne Terwilliger from the Cubs for pitcher Joe Hatten, catcher Bruce Edwards, infielder Eddie Miksis and outfielder Gene Hermanski.\nThe New York Yankees make two deals. They acquire left-hander Bob Kuzava from the Washington Senators for three right-handed hurlers, Tom Ferrick, Bob Porterfield and Fred Sanford. Then the Yankees also obtain southpaw Stubby Overmire from the St. Louis Browns for lefty Tommy Byrne and $25,000.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals make a two for five trade, with the Pirates sending hurler Cliff Chambers and outfielder Wally Westlake to the Cardinals for pitchers Howie Pollet and Ted Wilks, catcher Joe Garagiola, infielder Dick Cole and outfielder Bill Howerton.\nJune 19 – Billy Southworth resigns as manager of the Boston Braves with his team tied for fifth place in the National League and 10½ games out of the lead. The Braves promote popular former right fielder Tommy Holmes, 34, from Hartford to replace him. Southworth, 58, retires from managing with a 1,044–704 record over 13 seasons; his .597 winning percentage is second-best all-time. He won four NL pennants: three straight (1942–1944) as skipper of the St. Louis Cardinals (along with the 1942 and 1944 World Series); and one with the Braves (in 1948). He will be posthumously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008.\nJune 22 – Bill Veeck, the flamboyant former owner of the Cleveland Indians, announces that he has purchased controlling interest in the downtrodden St. Louis Browns from owners Bill and Charles DeWitt. Veeck, 37, will complete the transaction July 4 when he acquires additional stock in the Browns to assume 75 percent ownership. He has been out of baseball since 1949, when he sold his share in the Indians during a divorce settlement.\nJune 30 – The New York Giants claim utility infielder Hank Schenz on waivers from the Pittsburgh Pirates. Schenz will appear in only eight games while spending the rest of the season on New York's roster; however, decades later, it will be alleged that the spyglass he employs to steal signs will be instrumental in the Giants' white-hot 37–7 late-season winning streak that propels them into the 1951 National League tie-breaker series.\n\nJuly\nJuly 1 – In the first game of a doubleheader, Bob Feller tosses the third no-hitter of his career for the Cleveland Indians in a 2–1 win over the Detroit Tigers.\nJuly 4\nAt Ebbets Field, the Brooklyn Dodgers sweep a Fourth of July doubleheader from their archrivals, the New York Giants, 6–5 (11 innings) and 4–2. The twin victories enable the Dodgers (46–26) to widen their National League lead to 6½ games over the second-place Giants (41–34) at the 1951 season's unofficial halfway mark. Meanwhile, in the American League, the Chicago White Sox (46–27) regain a slim, half-game lead when they split a twin bill with the Detroit Tigers, and the onrushing New York Yankees (44–26) are slowed by dropping a doubleheader to the Washington Senators.\nRalph Kiner belts two home runs in the second game of a Forbes Field holiday twin bill, enabling his Pittsburgh Pirates to overwhelm the Cincinnati Reds 16–4 in a seven-inning official game halted by rain. The Pirates and Reds split the doubleheader, but Cincinnati manager Luke Sewell protests both contests because Kiner remains in the Bucs' lineup despite being suspended by the National League just before the start of Game 1 for a recent dust-up with umpire Jocko Conlan.\nJuly 5 – With his estimated $1.5 million purchase completed, Bill Veeck becomes president and 75% owner of the St. Louis Browns. He promises \"sweeping changes\" for the last-place team, which has also finished last in MLB team attendance for every year since 1946.\nJuly 10 – Exploding for a record four home runs, the National League trounces the American League, 8–3, at the annual All-Star Game, at Briggs Stadium in Detroit. Pittsburgh Pirates' slugger Ralph Kiner hits a home run for the third year in a row.\nJuly 12\nNew York Yankees hurler Allie Reynolds pitches a no-hitter against the Cleveland Indians in a 1–0 win.\nIt takes 17 innings to settle a \"Battle of the Soxes,\" but the Boston Red Sox defeat the Chicago White Sox, 5–4, at Comiskey Park. Boston's Ellis Kinder throws ten innings of shutout relief, and Chicago's starting pitcher, Saul Rogovin, goes all 17 innings and ends up with the loss. The win is the Red Sox' seventh straight and gives them a 1½-game lead in the AL standings.\nJuly 14\nAlthough he had vowed to serve out his term \"until the last second\" when it expires on April 30, 1952, lame-duck Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler resigns, leaving the post temporarily vacant. Prominent names such as retired General of the Army Douglas MacArthur are floated as possible successors, but it's quickly reported that MLB owners wish to promote someone from inside the game to replace Kentucky politician Chandler.\nAfter pitching for Bill Veeck in Cleveland in 1948–1949, 45-year-old free agent Satchel Paige rejoins him with the St. Louis Browns.\nJuly 15 – Left-hander Sam Zoldak of the Philadelphia Athletics one-hits the Chicago White Sox, while getting two \"knocks\" and two RBIs himself. Chico Carrasquel's third-inning single is Chicago's only hit—and Zoldak picks him off first base. The 5–0 win enables the lowly Athletics to sweep the twin bill at Comiskey Park.\nJuly 19 – Paul Lehner is claimed off waivers by the Cleveland Indians, enabling the veteran outfielder to play for four of the eight American League teams during the 1951 regular season.\nJuly 21 – The Chicago Cubs (35–45, seventh in the NL) change pilots, replacing veteran Frankie Frisch with a player-manager, first baseman Phil Cavarretta. The move signals the end of the Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman's 16-year managing career.\nJuly 22 – The New York Yankees sweep a Sunday doubleheader from the St. Louis Browns at Sportsman's Park, 9–0 and 7–3, and the Boston Red Sox defeat the Detroit Tigers, 10–9 at Briggs Stadium, in their single game. Coupled with the Chicago White Sox' twin defeats at the hands of the Washington Senators at Griffith Stadium, 7–6 and 11–5, the Yankees pull into a virtual tie for first place with the Red Sox and White Sox.\nJuly 23 – A \"ding-dong\" affair at Forbes Field sees the Boston Braves score seven runs in the first inning, and the Pittsburgh Pirates respond with six tallies of their own. The Bucs take the lead 14–11 after six innings, but Boston battles back with four runs in the seventh and eighth, and pulls out a 15–14 win. Of the Braves' 22 hits, the winning blow is an eighth-inning single by Roy Hartsfield.\nJuly 28\nClyde Vollmer, who started the month on the Boston Red Sox' bench, continues his slugging fireworks against the Cleveland Indians. Vollmer singles in the tying run in the 15th inning and then in the 16th hits a grand slam off reliever Bob Feller for an 8–4 Red Sox win. The slam is the latest hit in a game in major-league history. Mickey McDermott pitches all 16 innings for the Sox, striking out 15 and walking one.\nBilly Evans, general manager of the Detroit Tigers since January 1, 1947, announces his resignation, effective October 1. Charlie Gehringer, the Tigers' Hall of Fame former second baseman, will succeed him.\n\nAugust\nAugust 1 – The regular season's penultimate month dawns with the Brooklyn Dodgers (63–32) leading the New York Giants (56–44) by 9½ games (12 in the loss column) in the National League standings. In the American League, the New York Yankees (59–35) lead the second-place Cleveland Indians (58–38) by two lengths and the third-place Boston Red Sox (57–39) by three.\nAugust 7 – Dick Sisler's RBI single in the home half of the 15th gives the Philadelphia Phillies a 1–0 triumph over the Boston Braves. Defending NL champion Philadelphia is 55–51 and, at 13½ games, well out of the 1951 pennant race.\nAugust 9 – The Brooklyn Dodgers complete a three-game, Ebbets Field series sweep of the second-place New York Giants, 6–5. Roy Campanella bashes two homers, including the game-winner in the seventh inning off Sheldon Jones, and Clyde King picks up his second victory in as many games. The Giants now trail the Dodgers by 121⁄2 games—15 in the loss column—with 45 games left in the regular season.\nAugust 11 – Robin Roberts of the Philadelphia Phillies beats the Giants, 4–0, briefly dropping the Giants a season-high 131⁄2 games behind the first-place Brooklyn Dodgers. However, the Dodgers lose a half-game of their lead when they drop the second game of a Saturday doubleheader, 8–4, to the Boston Braves.\nAugust 12 – The Giants sweep the Phillies in a Polo Grounds Sunday twin bill, 3–2 and 2–1. The victories begin the Giants' 16-game winning streak and a phenomenal 37–7 (.841) stretch run that enables them to tie for the NL pennant on the regular season's final day.\nAugust 15 – The Cleveland Indians defeat the St. Louis Browns behind Early Wynn at Sportsman's Park. The victory is Cleveland's 13th in a row and enables the Tribe to maintain a 2½-game advantage over the New York Yankees.\nAugust 19 – Bill Veeck, the showman and maverick owner of the St. Louis Browns, pulls off one of the greatest stunts in baseball history.  In the second game of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers, Veeck sends Eddie Gaedel to the plate as a pinch-hitter for leadoff batter Frank Saucier.  At 3 feet 7 inches (1.09 m) tall, Gaedel becomes the shortest player in baseball annals.  Due to his extremely small strike zone, Gaedel walks on four consecutive pitches and is immediately replaced by a pinch-runner. American League president Will Harridge, saying Veeck is making a mockery of the game, voids Gaedel's contract the next day.  Detroit goes on to win the game, 6–2.\nAugust 24 – Just five days after the Gaedel stunt, Veeck stages another headlining promotion, \"Grandstand Managers Night,\" at Sportsman's Park. A select group of 1,000 fans seated in a special section of the ballpark and equipped with YES and NO placards decides game strategy — while the St. Louis Browns' veteran manager, Zack Taylor, sits in a rocking chair, smoking a pipe, in the Brownie dugout. The \"grandstand managers\" even help Taylor make out his lineup card. The promotion has mixed results: a paltry 3,925 attend the contest, but the 38–81 Browns defeat the 49–75 Philadelphia Athletics, 5–3, with Ned Garver improving to 15–8 on the season.\nAugust 27 – The New York Giants extend their winning streak to 16 games, sweeping the Chicago Cubs in a Polo Grounds doubleheader, 5–4 (12 innings) and 6–3. The Giants have now shaved the Brooklyn Dodgers' National League lead to five games, six in the loss column.\nAugust 29 – With four-plus weeks remaining in the regular season, there is a torrid pennant race in the American League. The Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees have been trading blows all this month; today Cleveland, which held a three-game lead as recently as August 23, falls into a dead heat with the Yankees at 80–47, when they fall to the Philadelphia Athletics, 3–0, and the Yankees overwhelm the St. Louis Browns, 15–2.\n\nSeptember\nSeptember 1 – New York Giants outfielder Don Mueller hits three home runs and drove in five runs in an 8–1 victory over the Brooklyn Dodgers at Polo Grounds.  Sal Maglie is the winning pitcher. Dodgers starter Ralph Branca‚ coming off two consecutive shutouts‚ lasts only four innings. The only run for Brooklyn comes on a hit by pitch, when Maglie hits Jackie Robinson with the bases loaded in the third inning. The Giants' Whitey Lockman is plunked twice, by Dodgers relievers Bud Podbielan and Phil Haugstad. In a flashy fielding play, shortstop Alvin Dark and second baseman Eddie Stanky combine in the fifth inning on a triple play off a liner by Dodgers shortstop Pee Wee Reese.\nSeptember 3 – Labor Day doubleheaders see the Dodgers sweep the Boston Braves and the Giants split with the Philadelphia Phillies. Meanwhile, the Cleveland Indians sweep the Chicago White Sox and the New York Yankees split with the Philadelphia Athletics. The standings: in the National League, the Dodgers (84–47) lead the Giants (79–54) by six games; and in the American League, Cleveland (84–49) holds a half-game edge over New York (82–48).\nSeptember 14 – At Fenway Park, Bob Nieman of the St. Louis Browns becomes the first player in history to hit two home runs in his first two MLB plate appearances. Nieman will be joined by Bert Campaneris (1964), Mark Quinn (1999), J.P. Arencibia (2010) and Trevor Story (2016) in the select group of players who have hit two homers in their debut game.\nSeptember 17 – A crucial, three-game series between the American League's two top teams in The Bronx concludes, turning the tide of the pennant race. The New York Yankees (now 89–53) defeat the Cleveland Indians, 2–1, when Phil Rizzuto's ninth-inning bunt single scores Joe DiMaggio from third base with the winning run. Eddie Lopat wins his 20th game, defeating Bob Lemon. The Yankees take two out of three from Cleveland (now 90–56) and a one-game lead in the standings. The Indians will go only 3–5 over their final eight games, while the Yankees will finish 9–3, including a humiliating five-game sweep over the third-place Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park to close the season. They will clinch the pennant September 28.\nSeptember 20 – Ford Frick, 56, president of the National League since 1934, is elected the third Commissioner of Baseball and takes office immediately. Cincinnati Reds president/general manager Warren Giles, 55, the runner-up in the balloting, will succeed Frick as the Senior Circuit's chief executive. In Frick, MLB owners choose a baseball insider, unlike the first two Commissioners, a federal judge (Kenesaw Mountain Landis) and a politician (Happy Chandler).\nSeptember 27 – Gabe Paul, vice president and traveling secretary of the Cincinnati Reds, is promoted to general manager, succeeding long-time mentor Warren Giles, now president of the National League. At 41, Paul is the youngest general manager in the majors.\nSeptember 28 – Allie Reynolds turns in the second no-hitter of his career, and his second this season, as the New York Yankees blank the Boston Red Sox, 8–0, in the first game of a Fenway Park doubleheader. Reynolds' no-no clinches a tie for the American League pennant. Then, in Game 2, the Yankees seal their 18th league title with an 11–3 thumping.\n\nOctober\nOctober 3 – The New York Giants had been thirteen and one-half games behind the National League leading Brooklyn Dodgers in August, but under Leo Durocher's guidance and with the aid of a sixteen-game winning streak, caught the Dodgers to tie for the lead with two days left in the season. As both teams won their last two games, they ended up tied. The two teams play a best-of three playoff. In Game 3 with one out in the ninth inning and runners on second and third, the Giants were down 4–2 to the Dodgers when Bobby Thomson hit a home run to win the game 5–4. The \"Shot heard 'round the world\" clinched the National League pennant for the Giants, and WMCA-AM radio announcer Russ Hodges' frantic \"The Giants win the pennant!\", said four times consecutively, is one of the most famous home run calls in baseball history.\nOctober 8 – In a marriage of opposite personalities, showman owner Bill Veeck names irascible former Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman Rogers Hornsby manager of the 1952 St. Louis Browns, replacing Zack Taylor. Upon his appointment, Hornsby promises \"no midgets, no gimmicks, just good baseball.\"\nOctober 10 – The New York Yankees defeat the New York Giants, 4–3, in Game 6 of the World Series to win their third consecutive World Championship, and fourteenth overall. Just before the game, Giants manager Leo Durocher turns over a letter he received to Ford Frick that offered the Giants manager a $15,000 bribe \"if the Giants managed to lose the next 3 games\".\nOctober 17 – The Yomiuri Giants win the Japan Series over the Nankai Hawks. The Giants went on to win the Central League pennant 19 times in the next 23 years, including nine in succession (1965–73).\nOctober 22 – The third-place Boston Red Sox, who lost 12 of their last 13 games to finish 87–67 in 1951, replace veteran manager Steve O'Neill with infielder Lou Boudreau, who has just completed his first season in a Red Sox uniform. Boudreau, 34, formerly was the player-manager of the Cleveland Indians from 1942 to 1950, and in his most famous season, 1948, led the Indians to a playoff victory over the Red Sox, and—ultimately—a World Series championship.\n\nNovember\nNovember 1 – Brooklyn Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella is named National League Most Valuable Player, the first of three awards he will receive during his Hall of Fame career. During the season, Campanella hit a .325 batting average with 33 home runs and 108 run batted in.\nNovember 10 – In Tokyo, Japan 50,000 fans are on hand as an American All-Star team battles a Central League All-Star team. Joe DiMaggio hits a 400-foot home run in the eighth inning to tie the game at 1–1, then his younger brother Dom laces an RBI-triple in the ninth and later scores to give the Americans a 3–2 victory. The Americans have won 12 games and tied one.\nNovember 23 – The New York Yankees send young catcher Clint Courtney to the St. Louis Browns in exchange for pitcher Jim McDonald. Courtney, regarded as the first major league catcher to wear eyeglasses, had appeared in one game for New York.\nNovember 24 – The St. Louis Cardinals fire manager Marty Marion after only one season at the team's helm. Eight-time NL All-Star shortstop Marion, 33, led the 1951 Redbirds to an 81–73 mark and third-place finish.\nNovember 27 – In an eight-player trade, the St. Louis Browns send catcher Sherm Lollar, pitcher Al Widmar and infielder Tom Upton to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for catcher Gus Niarhos, pitcher Dick Littlefield, first baseman Gordon Goldsberry, shortstop Joe DeMaestri and outfielder Jim Rivera. Rivera, a favorite of Browns' manager Rogers Hornsby, will be traded back to the ChiSox in eight months.\nNovember 28 – The Browns trade Niarhos, along with outfielder Ken Wood to the Boston Red Sox for catcher Les Moss and outfielder Tom Wright. The Browns also sign veteran free-agent shortstop Marty Marion, fired as the St. Louis Cardinals' manager four days earlier, as an active player.\n\nDecember\nDecember 11\nThree-time MVP and 13-time All Star center fielder Joe DiMaggio officially retires as a member of the New York Yankees at age 37. In a 13-season career for the club, DiMaggio posted a .325 batting average with 361 home runs and 1,537 runs batted in in 1,736 games played.

        "content": "Elections of police and crime commissioners in England and Wales were held on 5 May 2016.\nThe elections were for 40 of the 43 territorial police forces in England and Wales using the supplementary vote system; the two police forces of Greater London are not involved (the elected Mayor of London is classed as the police and crime commissioner for the Metropolitan Police District, while the Court of Common Council fulfils the role for the City of London Police). There was no election for the Greater Manchester Police as the role of police and crime commissioner was due to be abolished in 2017 and replaced with the directly elected Mayor of Greater Manchester. Elections for police and crime commissioners do not take place in Scotland or Northern Ireland as policing and justice powers are devolved to the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly.\nThis was the second time police and crime commissioner elections had been held.\n\nBackground\nThe election used the supplementary vote system: voters were instructed to mark the ballot paper with their first and second choices of candidate (although there were an unusually large number of spoilt ballots). If no candidate got a majority of first preference votes, the top two candidates went on to a second round in which second preference votes of the eliminated candidates were allocated to them to produce a winner. This is the system used to elect London's mayor. Section 57 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 directs that the voting system is first past the post if there are only two candidates for a specific commissioner region.\nThe role of police and crime commissioner for the Greater Manchester Police was abolished in 2017 and replaced with the directly elected Mayor of Greater Manchester, who assumed the responsibilities of the police and crime commissioner. No election was therefore held in 2016 and Tony Lloyd remained as police and crime commissioner and interim mayor until the mayoral election took place in 2017.\n\nParties standing\nBoth Labour and the Conservatives fielded candidates in all 40 elections, while UKIP fielded 34 candidates and the Liberal Democrats 30 candidates. The Green Party fielded seven candidates and the English Democrats four candidates. Plaid Cymru fielded candidates for all four Welsh seats. There were 29 other candidates; 25 stood as independents and four stood under other labels (one as Lincolnshire Independents and three as Zero Tolerance Policing ex Chief).\n\nResults summary\nVote and seat changes are calculated with reference to the 2012 election, excluding Greater Manchester which was not up for election in 2016, due to being replaced by a Metro Mayor.\n\nEngland\nAvon and Somerset Constabulary\nSue Mountstevens (Independent), incumbent, sought re-election.\n\nKerry Barker (Labour), criminal law barrister.\nChris Briton (Green), former Mayor of Wells City Council and probation officer.\nPaul Crossley (Liberal Democrat), Bath & North East Somerset Councillor and former Council leader.\nAaron Foot (UKIP), a farm owner.\nKevin Phillips (Independent), former Chairman of Avon and Somerset Police Federation\nMark Weston (Conservative), leader of the Conservative group on Bristol City Council.\n\nBedfordshire Constabulary\nOlly Martins (Labour and Co-operative), incumbent, sought re-election.\n\nToni Bugle (English Democrats)\nKathryn Holloway (Conservative), former television presenter.\nDuncan Strachan (UKIP)\nLinda Jack (Liberal Democrat),\n\nCambridgeshire Constabulary\nSir Graham Bright (Conservative), incumbent, did not seek re-election.\n\nJason Ablewhite (Conservative), leader of Huntingdonshire District Council.\nDave Baigent (Labour), former firefighter.\nRupert Moss-Eccardt (Liberal Democrat)\nNick Clarke (UKIP), former leader of Cambridgeshire County Council.\n\nCheshire Constabulary\nJohn Dwyer (Conservative), incumbent, sought re-election.\n\nDavid Keane (Labour), member of Warrington Borough Council.\nNeil Lewis (Liberal Democrats), local entrepreneur and former member of the Economist Group.\nJonathan Charles Starkey (UKIP), composer and pianist.\n\nCleveland Police\nBarry Coppinger (Labour), incumbent, sought re-election.\n\nSultan Alam (independent)\nSteve Matthews (UKIP)\nMatthew Vickers (Conservative), member of Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council.\n\nCumbria Constabulary\nRichard Rhodes (Conservative), incumbent, did not seek re-election.

        "content": "Alexander Matthew Wright (born 8 July 1965) is an English television presenter and former tabloid journalist. He worked as a journalist for The Sun and was a showbusiness gossip columnist for The Daily Mirror before launching a television career. He hosted the Channel 5 topical debate show The Wright Stuff from  2000 to 2018. Wright occasionally appears on This Morning discussing current affairs.\n\nEarly life and education\nWright started his career at the age of 14, appearing in the Children's Film Foundation production Big Wheels And Sailor (1979).\nHe was educated at the voluntary-aided Roman Catholic boys' school, The John Fisher School in Purley, Croydon, Surrey and was in the same class as the artist and sculptor Diarmuid Bryon O'Connor and DJ Gilles Peterson. \nWhen joining the school,  he began as a grammar entrant, having passed the 11-plus, but the school only remained (officially) as a grammar school for one more year, so he saw the gradual transformation into a comprehensive school.\nHe also attended Croydon Youth Theatre. Following school, Wright attended the University of Exeter, graduating in English and Drama.\n\nCareer\nWright started at the Surrey Mail group of newspapers in Godalming as a junior journalist under the tutorledge of editor Peter Tribe. Wright became a showbusiness correspondent with The Sun and later wrote a column for the Daily Mirror in the 1990s, with future 3AM girl Polly Graham as his assistant. During his time at the Daily Mirror, Wright covered numerous celebrity stories, including the wedding of Phil Collins and Orianne Cevey in 1999, which he claimed was the longest wedding he had ever been to. In 2002, Wright was a contributor to Phil Collins: A Life Less Ordinary, a BBC television documentary which profiled Collins's career, which was subsequently released commercially.\nIn 1998, Wright and the Daily Mirror were successfully sued for libel for £20,000 by actor David Soul, after Wright referred to the play The Dead Monkey in a review as being \"without doubt the worst West End show I have ever seen\", despite not having seen it. Wright also made several other false claims about the play in his article. Soul stated that Wright was \"using the play as an excuse to attack me personally\".\n\nThe Wright Stuff\nWright left the Daily Mirror in 2000 to pursue a television career and launch the website mykindaplace.com. He was chosen to front Channel 5's daily topical discussion series The Wright Stuff, which started broadcasting in September 2000. Wright originally co-presented the series with panellists James O'Brien and Kate Silverton. After a couple of years, O'Brien and Silverton were replaced by a new panel every week and the series began attracting celebrities to guest on the panel every day.\nIn 2002, Wright named John Leslie live on air as the television presenter being linked to the alleged rape of Ulrika Jonsson. Wright subsequently said he could not remember saying Leslie's name during the show. In a Sky 1 show, John Leslie: My Year of Hell, Wright offered John Leslie an apology. Leslie confirmed he would not sue Wright, saying: \"I think he just made a really big mistake and unfortunately I was the one paying the price.\"\nIn October 2011, Wright asked male viewers of The Wright Stuff if they would have sex with Amanda Knox, who had just been acquitted of the murder of Meredith Kercher. Wright introduced a debate on Knox's future with an on-screen caption headed \"Foxy Knoxy: Would Ya?\" and told viewers: \"She's entirely innocent. She's also undeniably fit and loves wild sex. Or did. So if you were a guy who'd met her in a bar and she invited you back to hers, would you go?\" Wright apologised for the segment the following day, stating: \"While I'm not going to apologise for discussing Amanda Knox's future after all the terrible things the media has said about her these past four years, I do want to say sorry for the way I framed the debate. The on-screen title was wrong, no doubt about it.\"\nIn December 2011, during a discussion on his show of the murder of Scottish teenager Liam Aitchison, Wright said in a mock Scottish accent \"There's been another murder!\", a reference to the television series Taggart. This led to more than 2,000 viewer complaints and an investigation by regulator Ofcom. This edition of The Wright Stuff resulted in more complaints being made to Ofcom than any other programme in 2011. Wright personally wrote to Aitchison's family by way of apology.\nOne of Wright’s penchant on the show was to be regularly taken in by prank callers. One example is of a former gentleman partner of Sharon Goodman, who has on multiple occasions called into the show to voice his displeasure over the seemingly tumultuous nature of their uncoupling. Instead of professionally brushing off the interruption's and continuing with the show, Wrights tendacy to throw a hissy fit often brought the calls to wider attention and added unintentional additional humour to the situation. [1] \nWright announced on 1 May 2018 that he was to leave The Wright Stuff after 18 years. Wright's last show was broadcast on 14 June 2018, and various guest presenters took turns at presenting throughout the forthcoming summer. The show has continued with Jeremy Vine hosting Jeremy Vine.\n\nOther broadcasting and media\nIn 2007, Wright was announced as the lead presenter on BBC One's Inside Out programme in the London area.\nIn September 2011, Wright joined the Daily Star Sunday as a columnist, but was dropped by the newspaper in March 2012.\nIn November 2013, Wright appeared in the 13th series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. During this time on the series, The Wright Stuff was guest-presented by Richard Madeley for almost a month. He was the fourth participant to be voted out of the series in a double eviction with campmate Vincent Simone on 3 December.\nIn September 2018, Wright joined national speech station talkRADIO presenting weekday afternoons. He left the station in March 2020. As of November 2023, Matthew Wright has replaced Andrew Castle on Weekend Breakfast at LBC.\n\nPersonal life\nWright's first marriage ended in a bitter legal battle that he said \"made me wary of relationships\". In 2003, he started a relationship with Closer columnist Caroline Monk. He met his second wife, Amelia Gatte, at a garden party held by their mutual friend Miriam Stoppard. They married in 2010. In 2013, they revealed they were trying to conceive a baby with the help of in vitro fertilisation but three of their IVF pregnancies so far had ended in a miscarriage. His wife is unable to become pregnant naturally following an ectopic pregnancy. In September 2018 it was announced they are expecting their first child. Their daughter, Cassady, was born in January 2019.\nDespite his relationships with women, Wright has said that he is \"a slightly camp man. I can't be any other way, so if people want to imagine that they're my gay lovers, more power to them.\" Wright has said that \"everyone thinks I'm gay\".\nWright is a fan of live music and regularly attends concerts. In 2003, he performed on stage with his favourite band, Hawkwind, at the London Astoria, after interviewing the band's frontman Dave Brock on radio. He is now a friend of the band. He also released a single with them, \"Spirit of the Age\", in 2006, and is credited on their album Take Me To Your Leader, released the same year. A fan of progressive rock, Wright was the host of Prog magazine's annual Progressive Music Awards for four years until 2017.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nMatthew Wright at IMDb\nMatthew Wright on LBC"

As such, I thought I'd provide the full summary here:\n\nRemoved sentence \"Trump had a persistently high popularity among Republican and leaning-Republican minority voters\". None of the four cited sources explicitly or even somewhat back up this claim. One source is a poll that shows Clinton leading among minority voters, but doesn't specify the views of minority Republicans specifically. Another is about the National Black Republican Association endorsing Trump. The third is about a group of black pastors endorsing Trump, while the fourth has a Trump advisor talking about how much Hispanics love him, but then notes that \"One national poll this fall had Mr. Trump’s unfavorability among Hispanics at a death-rattling 82 percent.\" Together, none of these citations support the stated claim.

        "content": "Representative matches in Australian rules football are matches between representative teams played under the Australian rules, most notably of the colonies and later Australian states and territories that have been held since 1879.\nFor most of the 20th century, the absence of a national club competition in Australia and international matches meant that intercolonial and later interstate matches were regarded with great importance.\nInterstate matches were, in most cases, sanctioned and coordinated by the Australian National Football Council (ANFC), which organised every national championship series from the first-ever national carnival, the Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival in 1908 with the exception of the last-ever series: the 1993 State of Origin Championships, which was run by the AFL Commission. The series took place on approximately three-yearly intervals between 1908 and 1993; these were usually a fortnight-long tournament staged in a single host city, although some –  particularly those played in the 1980s –  were based on the results of matches played in different cities throughout the year. Between 1937 and 1988, the player judged the best at each of these carnivals was awarded the Tassie Medal; and between 1953 and 1988, the selection of All Australian Teams was based on the player's performance during Australian Football Carnivals, and the team was named after each carnival concluded.\nUntil June 1977, interstate Australian rules football games were played by teams representing the major football leagues or organisations, with players representing the state or territory they were playing in at the time. From October, 1977 until May, 1999, players were selected for their states under partial or full State of Origin selection rules. Football historian John Devaney has argued that \"some of the state of origin contests which took place during the 1980s constituted arguably the finest expositions of the game ever seen\".\nThere have been no regular representative Australian rules football matches featuring players from the fully professional Australian Football League since 1999. Representatives matches continue to be played annually between teams representing the state or territorial leagues at the second tier or below. One senior women's State of Origin match was played in 2017. Representative matches are played at underage level as part of the men's and women's Underage National Championships, notably the AFL Under-19 Championships and AFL Women's Under-18 Championships.\nThroughout its pre–State of Origin history, Victoria, as represented by the Victorian Football League, was the dominant state in representative football, winning 16 of the 19 carnivals up until 1975. Competition was more even during the nine competitions held in the State of Origin selection era, with championships shared among Western Australia (4), South Australia (3) and Victoria (2).\n\nHistory\nIntercolony / Interstate competition, 1879–1939\nVictoria, the birthplace of Australian rules and, with contributing factors such as population and finances, dominated the first hundred years of intercolonial and interstate football. This was the case in the first-ever intercolonial representative match, held on Tuesday, 1 July 1879 (a public holiday), at East Melbourne Cricket Ground. The final score was Victoria (represented by the Victorian Football Association) 7.14 to South Australia 0.3. The match was attended by more than 10,000 people.\nThe third and fourth teams to commence intercolonial competition were New South Wales and Queensland, playing each other in a two-game series in Brisbane in 1884; the result of the series was a one-all draw. Tasmania played its first game, against Victoria, in 1887. New Zealand (Maori) entered the competition with a draw against New South Wales in Sydney, on 29 June 1889.\nVictoria's long-term dominance briefly faltered in the 1890s, when other Colonies recorded their first-ever wins over the Victoria: South Australia in Adelaide in 1890 and 1891 and Tasmania in Hobart in 1893 (twice). In 1897, the new Victorian Football League split from the VFA, and the two selected separate representative teams, further weakening Victoria in intercolonial competition, which became interstate competition following Federation of the six British colonies in Australia, in 1901.\nWestern Australia played its first two interstate games in 1904, including a win over South Australia in Adelaide. The Australasian Football Council was established 1906, and it assumed administration for interstate football.\n\nThe VFL's dominance within Victoria was established by the time an interstate carnival was held for the first time – in Melbourne in 1908 – to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of \"Australasian football\" (as it was known at the time). The widening gap between the three major footballing States/leagues and the others was shown in the organisation of the competition: Victoria (represented by the VFL), South Australia and Western Australia constituted \"Section A\", and Tasmania, New South Wales, Queensland and New Zealand constituted \"Section B\". The VFA did not take part and the carnival was New Zealand's last appearance in representative football. Victoria went through the competition undefeated.\nThe second carnival was played in 1911, in Adelaide, which set the pattern of a carnival every three years. South Australia went undefeated and Victoria won three of their four matches. At the Sydney carnival of 1914, Victoria was once again undefeated. Following the onset of World War I interstate matches went into a five-year hiatus.\n\nThroughout following decades, standalone interstate matches were held every year, and interstate carnivals were held usually every three years, with a few exceptions.  In most carnivals following World War II, the stronger states competed separately from the minor states; and on many occasions the stronger states and minor states carnivals were held in separate locations or years. At the peak of its popularity, the carnival was known symbolically as \"the Ashes\" of Australian rules football. Victoria (VFL) continued its dominance in interstate football by winning 17 of the 20 carnivals held between the period 1908 to 1975, and usually winning the individual matches held every year.\n\nSome notable moments during this period were, the 1923 Victorian loss to South Australia, which was described as the state's worst ever defeat. The 1923 South Australian upset loss to an undermanned Tasmania. The championship-deciding game of the 1924 carnival, between Victoria and Western Australia, was reported as being the roughest on record. Also in 1924 South Australia recorded the concepts highest winning score, winning by 268 points to defeat Queensland in Hobart. In the 1925 calendar year, Canberra played its first match against New South Wales. In 1923 & 1925 Victoria lost shock upsets to New South Wales. In 1927, in the Australia National Football Carnival Victoria beat Western Australia 11.10 to 10.12, in what has been described as one of the hardest and fiercest games fought in the history of the code. In 1928 Victoria and South Australia participated in the first drawn representative match: the visiting Victorians led for most of the match, with South Australia kicking three late goals to give the state the victory by a point; however, after the match, it was discovered that the scoreboard had failed to record one of Victoria's behinds, and the match was declared a draw.\n\nPost World War II (1945 to 1977)\nIn the second game between South Australia and Victoria after war, the states participated in the second representative draw, in a high scoring affair with the side locked in at 123 to 123 at full time. In 1948, Victoria played Western Australia for the first time in ten years, which Western Australia went on to win by 38 points, in what was described as a memorable victory.\nThe Australian National Football Council expanded in 1949, which saw the Victoria Football Association and the Australian Amateur Football Council each re-enter teams in carnival and interstate competitions. The Amateurs were frequent winners of the second division carnivals, and the VFA recorded an upset 8-point win against South Australia at the 1950 interstate carnival. The VFA overall had mixed results while readmitted back, with some wins over some of the main states, and large losses, and established a rivalry with Tasmania against whom it had a number of close results on both sides. In 1959, Victoria beat Western Australia by 178 points, with the loss in Western Australia being taken so badly that it had been reported as potentially being the end of interstate football in the state. Tasmania finished of the decade strongly, with two surprise carnival upsets over South Australia in 1956 and 1958 and Western Australia in 1958.\nIn the first half of the 1960s saw a brief changing of the guard, with South Australia and Western Australia recording several wins over Victoria, and an upset win by Tasmania over Victoria in 1960, considered one of Tasmanian football's greatest moments. Also the 1963 Tasmanian victory over reigning interstate carnival champions Western Australia. Those were Victoria's last losses of the pre-origin selection era, and Victoria went on a 12-year winning streak against Western Australia and an 18-year winning streak against South Australia.\nNeil Kerley and Graham Cornes were of significance in the rivalry between Victoria and South Australia, who played for and coached the South Australia team during this period. Neil Kerley when coaching the South Australian team would engender a hatred for Victoria, telling his players that all Victorian umpires and players cheated. Graham Cornes, who was coached by Kerley for South Australia and was later a coach and central figure in the promotion of interstate football in South Australia, later stated that his hatred for Victoria came from Neil Kerley, and in establishing the culture in South Australia of wanting to prove superiority over Victoria. In the 1963 game, after Victorian Jack Dyer was asked what he would do if he was coaching Victoria, and disrespectfully responded I'd give them a pep talk and go to the races, Kerley opened the match by putting down two Victorians with heavy bumps, and South Australia went on to win by seven points.\nIn the first half of the 1970s, there were some important games played: in 1970 Western Australia played Victoria in Melbourne, with the home side winning by six points. The match was notable because of a native born Western Australian player, playing for Victoria, being involved in the winning play. After the match with the result not taken well in the west, because of the observation that this had been a regular occurrence, it was first started being mentioned that games should be played on State of Origin criteria. Likewise in the 1974 game between the states, with the same result occurring, with again a Western Australia player being involved in the winning play, it was reported in the west as being the last straw. After the game Western Australia began to negotiate for games to be played under State of Origin criteria.\nAlso in 1970 after a decade of surprise upsets, and large disappointing defeats, Tasmania recorded a memorable victory over Western Australia. In the lead up to the match, an over confident Western Australian captain Polly Farmer, announced to the media that That his side simply could not countenance anything other than a convincing win, and \"If we can't beat Tasmania, we ought to give the game away,. The Tasmanians stormed home in the final moments to win the game by two points. With the game notable, for thousands screaming onto the ground after the final siren. In 1974 the Northern Territory first participated in the concept, with a win over Queensland.\n\nState of Origin competition, 1977–1988\nBy the 1970s, VFL clubs were signing up an increasing number of the best players from other states and Victoria dominated state games. Led by Leon Larkin, marketing manager of the Subiaco Football Club, Western Australia began to campaign for players to be selected according to state-of-origin rules. The (WAFL) negotiated with the (VFL) for two years before agreement was reached on the format. In the first such game, at Subiaco Oval in Perth, on 8 October 1977, Western Australia defeated Victoria, 23.13 (151) to 8.9 (57), a huge reversal of the results in most previous games. In the words of football historian John Devaney:\n\n\"A Western Australian team composed entirely of home-based players had, on 25 June, taken on a Victorian team containing many of the same players who would return to Perth three and a half months later for the state of origin clash. The respective scores of the two matches offered a persuasive argument, if such were needed, of the extent to which the VFL had denuded the WAFL of its elite talent:\nOn 25 June 1977 Victoria 23.16 (154) defeated Western Australia 13.13 (91) – a margin of 63 points\nOn 8 October 1977 Western Australia 23.13 (151) defeated Victoria 8.9 (57) – a margin of 94 points, representing an overall turn around of 157 points\nWestern Australia's previous biggest winning margin against a Victorian state team had been a mere 38 points in 1948. Almost overnight, an inferiority complex was dismantled: Victoria, it seemed, was not intrinsically superior, only wealthier.\"\nGames involving each of the other states soon followed. Western Australia and South Australia began to win more games against Victoria.\nA full interstate carnival under state-of-origin selection was held with success in October 1979 in Perth. A second carnival was held the following October in Adelaide, but it was a financial disaster for the organisers, with only 28,245 people attending the four games. Following this series, the VFL decided to not participate in any future carnivals, which put the future of the carnival concept in doubt.\nBetween 1983 and 1987 there was a new format introduced, with only Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia competing, where each team would play each other once during the year, rather than in a standalone carnival, and with a points system and percentage used to declare the winner. Through this period, State of Origin football continued to be popular. However, after 1986, the concept began to wane in popularity in Western Australia, with the entrance of West Coast into the expanded Victorian Football League in 1987. When the 1988 Adelaide Bicentennial Carnival ran at a loss, the carnival concept was considered near finished.\n\n1990s: decline and end\nWith sponsorship from Carlton and United Breweries and the support of South Australia, the Commission organised for a blockbuster match in 1989, the first between South Australia and Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground since 1971. A record State of Origin crowd of 91,960 at the match (significantly exceeding the VFL's prediction of 70,000) signalled a strong return. The minor-states carnival continued in 1989, although the Northern Territory withdrew due to financial reasons and because the carnival was played outside its conventional summer season timing. The AFL later gained formal affiliations with these states and territories signalling the end of the NFL's involvement in interstate football. The AFL Commission, taking over the role from the NFL in 1991 ruled out the minor states including Queensland and New South Wales from again playing the major states under State of Origin rules. Ad hoc matches continued to be scheduled between 1989 and 1992 without a carnival. With the expansion of the Australian Football League into Queensland and Western Australia in 1987 and South Australia in 1991, the top Victorian players were now playing football matches in those states every second week as part of club matches, and a major part of the representative football's appeal disappeared.\nThe last interstate series recognised as a carnival was played in 1993; as a once-off, the AFL season was shortened from 22 rounds to 20 to accommodate the carnival, and two new composite teams QLD/NT and NSW/ACT were introduced. However, from 1992 until 1994, unusual timeslots and high ticket prices made the games inaccessible to many spectators. In 1994, Graham Cornes criticised the Commission for its poor promotion of State of Origin in comparison with its rugby league equivalent, while also noting the negative impact that the nationalisation of the AFL had on interstate football's prestige.\nIn the AFL Commission's five-year plan released in August 1994, the Commission announced further plans to reinvigorate State of Origin, attempting to establish a competition to rival Rugby League's equivalent; this included setting aside a free week in the fixture, and introducing a new composite team to be known as the Allies to represent all states outside Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia and be more competitive against them. Before a large crowd in 1995, between the Victoria and South Australia game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground Ted Whitten, promoter of Victoria and State of Origin, was terminally ill with prostate cancer, and was paraded around the ground prior to the match, with Mariah Carey's Hero being played over the PA system, for his service to the concept and the game, in a moment which has been voted as the most memorable moment in the game's history. However, Tom Hafey noted an increase in clubs discouraging players from playing due to risk of injury, and an increasing reluctance from players themselves.\nThere were two state of origin matches were played on a free weekend in the AFL season each year between 1995 and 1998, and they featured the same four teams: the Allies, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia – but aside from 1997 when a Victoria and South Australia game got a large crowd, low crowds and an annual $800,000 cost to stage the series persisted. Only one match was played in 1999, with Victoria 17.19 (121) defeating South Australia 10.7 (67) before a crowd of 26,063 in rainy conditions; it would prove to be the last state of origin game. The match dropped from the 2000 season because the season's compressed schedule – which saw it played a month earlier than usual to accommodate the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney – did not allow for the week's break; but state of origin never returned to the calendar thereafter.\n\n21st century\nThere have been two once-off representative matches played during the 21st century, each between Victoria and a single composite team representing the rest of Australia under state of origin selection rules. The first was the AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match, held on a free weekend in 2008 as part of that season's celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of Australian rules football. The second was the State of Origin for Bushfire Relief Match, a benefit match played during the 2020 preseason to raise funds for the recovery after the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season.\n\nImportance\nAt its peak, interstate matches were among the most important events on the annual football calendar in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The crowds drawn to interstate matches in those states regularly dwarfed home-and-away crowds, and at times throughout history would match or exceed grand final attendances. In Perth, interstate matches at the 1921 carnival, during the 1929 season, and at the 1937 carnival successively set records as Western Australia's highest-ever sports crowd; the crowd of 40,000 drawn to that 1937 match was more than 10,000 higher than any previous Western Australian crowd and almost double the record club grand final crowd at that time. Likewise in Tasmania, carnival fixtures in 1924, 1947 and 1966 each set new Tasmanian state football attendance records, and the 1966 carnival crowd of 23,764 remains the third-highest football attendance in Tasmania's history. State of Origin matches in the 1980s in South Australia and Western Australia regularly drew crowds between 30,000 and 50,000, on par with grand finals in those states during that era; and interstate matches in Tasmania consistently drew crowds which either exceeded or were second only to the Tasmanian league's grand final attendances.\nInterstate football was less popular in Victoria than it was in the other states. One match in Victoria in 1989 against South Australia set the national interstate football record crowd of 91,960, with 10,000 people turned away at the gate, and other large crowds at interstate games in Victoria were between 60,000 and 70,000, on par with some large home-and-away games but lower than a typical finals attendance. But, at its lowest, interstate games in Victoria during the 1930s could sometimes fail to draw 10,000 spectators – less than the average home-and-away crowd – at a time when state record crowds were drawn to the matches elsewhere. Eventually, due to these lower levels of public interest, less interstate football came to be played in Victoria: for the majority of the 1980s, when State of Origin football was at its peak, the Victorian team did not play a single match at home. The primary reason for the difference in popularity between Victoria and the other states was the Victorian team's historical dominance in interstate football. Particularly during the pre–State of Origin era, the Victorian team was always expected to win and regularly won easily; therefore, Victorian spectators were disinclined to attend matches because there was little importance on offer for victory and a high chance of a one-sided contest. The record crowd of 91,960 in Melbourne in 1989 came after South Australia had beaten Victoria three years in a row, demonstrating that Victorian fans were willing to embrace interstate football when the rivalry and contests were closely fought. Additionally, differences in supporter culture between the states meant that club football and club parochialism had much greater importance in Victoria than in the other states.\nAmongst the competing states, the rivalry with Victoria was the strongest. Victoria's long-term dominance of interstate football created a culture of disdain towards it; as a result, the most popular games always involved Victoria, and beating Victoria was considered the pinnacle of interstate football in South Australia and Western Australia. South Australia's rivalry towards Victoria was characterised during the 1980s with the slogan \"Kick a Vic\".\nPlayers from all states, including Victoria, viewed selection and participation in interstate football with great importance. Ted Whitten, who was widely noted for his involvement in and passion for the Victorian team described how \"the players would walk on broken glass to wear the Victorian jumper\". Graham Cornes, well known for his involvement in the South Australian team, always spoke equally proudly of the experience of representing his state. John Platten, a highly decorated player, described a drought-breaking victory playing for South Australia, over Victoria, as one of his proudest football moments. Comments from other players included:\n\nMatthew Lloyd (Victoria) – immense pride – you feel like you walk a bit taller when you pull on the Big V.\nStephen O'Reilly (Western Australia) – State of Origin football is the pinnacle for AFL players.\nAndrew McKay (South Australia) – I never dreamt of playing VFL/AFL as a child, but I always dreamt of playing for my state.\nGraham Cornes (South Australia) – pulling the South Australian jumper on is like a dream come true.\nTony Lockett (Victoria), who commented after he won the E. J. Whitten Medal – this will probably go down as one of the happiest days of my life, and I'll treasure it forever.\n\nSelection criteria\nThe State of Origin eligibility rules varied from game to game, and matches during the 1980s were sometimes played under partial, rather than full, State of Origin rules. This was in large part so that neutral leagues were not disrupted by a stand-alone game between two other states; e.g. VFL clubs would not lose access to interstate origin players on the weekend of a game between South Australia and Western Australia. For example, in the stand-alone 1982 match between South Australia and Victoria, a quota of up to six VFL players of South Australian origin, and no more than one from any VFL club, could play for South Australia; but otherwise, all SANFL and VFL players were eligible to play for South Australia and Victoria respectively – indeed Victoria fielded five VFL players of Western Australian origin in that match, including their captain, Mike Fitzpatrick. Jason Dunstall and Terry Daniher, who were born in and recruited from Queensland and New South Wales respectively, both played several partial-origin matches for Victoria; and in a partial-origin match against Victoria in 1990. New South Wales was allowed to be represented by players of New South Welsh origin and any player who had played for the Sydney Swans and Queensland was allowed to be represented by players of Queensland origin and any player who had played for the Brisbane Bears/Lions. Changes made in 1990 set a player's state of origin based on his registered state at age 15.\nRoger Merrett has played for and captained both Victoria (1984) and Queensland (1991).\n\nState of Origin in popular media\nGreg Champion wrote a song, \"Don't Let The Big V Down\", about the traditional navy blue jumper with a large white V used to represent Victoria in state games. The song is about a young man who is about to play his first state game and is approached by another man, who is Ted Whitten, and tells him to not let the Big V down.\nChampion also wrote another song, \"Came From Adelaide\", about two people watching a game between South Australia and Victoria. One of them turns to the other and says that the Croweaters cannot play. The other replies that this is not true and that the South Australians are great.\n\nTeam Uniforms\nTeam colours\nTeam representation\nTeams and games played\nTeams, awards and medals\nAustralian National Football Carnival teams (1908–1993)\nRivalries\nVictoria vs South Australia\nThe rivalry between Victoria and South Australia was considered the strongest in state football. Although there is a bitter rivalry on both sides, the make-up of the rivalry is slightly different: for Victoria, being the most successful state in interstate football, it meant that protecting that reputation was of prominent importance; for South Australia, the rivalry stemmed from dislike, and the feeling that Victorians did not give the state the respect it deserved. Graham Cornes, who was heavily involved in South Australian state football, described the football culture in Victoria as insular and having a lack of regard for football outside the state which drove that feeling.\nMany footballers described beating Victoria as one of the top achievements in South Australian football. Neil Kerley ranked beating Victoria above his club premierships. Victorian footballers have commented on the passion and hatred directed towards them in interstate games played in Adelaide. Garry Lyon described the fans as \"hostile and maniacal\" and \"by the time the games came around they were whipped into a frenzy\". Paul Roos commented about the first state game he played in South Australia that \"when walking up the entrance and onto Football Park was an experience in itself. I quickly realised how much hatred existed towards Victorians and their football.\"\n\nVictoria vs Western Australia\nThere is also an intense rivalry between Victoria and Western Australia. Western Australia's rivalry likewise stemmed from the feeling in Western Australia that Victoria never gave their state the credit it deserved, despite some of the best players of all time coming from the state. The Victorian and Western Australian rivalry was summarised in the early part of the 20th century as a friendly rivalry. In contrast with the Victoria vs South Australia rivalry which is based on hatred. This was evident in the first match between Victoria and Western Australia in Melbourne in 1904, where, before the game, the home Victorians put on a function for the two sides as a welcome. The function was reported to be well received by both sides. This is in contrast to the previous year's Victoria vs South Australia game in Melbourne, where no such function was held. After the rivalry evolved from first to the latter half of the 20th century, when Victoria stated to lure many of Western Australia's best players because of money, the rivalry started to take on dislike from Western Australia's part.\nSome games widely regarded as some of the best in the history of Australian football were played between Victoria and Western Australia in the 1980s. Shane Parker, a former Western Australia player, said of the rivalry: \"When I was a kid, the State of Origin games were the greatest ever. It was a really big thing to see the WA side play, particularly against Victoria.\"\n\nWestern Australia vs South Australia\nThere was an intense rivalry between Western Australia and South Australia, with fans at games between the states always vociferous and parochial.\n\nQueensland vs New South Wales\nQueensland and New South Wales are the two states where rugby football is most popular, having a rivalry in Rugby League and Rugby Union which is reflected in their encounters in Australian rules, having been evenly matched since they first met in the 1880s. While Queensland has shied away from competing in carnivals that include the stronger states, the neighbouring states have played, at times, annually. The gap narrowed until the 1970s, after which, on the few occasions they have met, Queensland has once again had the upper hand. State of origin matches between the two states in the 1980s were promoted to capitalise on the popularity of state of origin in Rugby League.\n\nResults\nAustralian National Football Carnival (1908–1993)\nFor most of the 20th century, there was a national football carnival usually held every three to five years. Some of the carnivals the format consisted of qualification matches at the start of the tournament, with the winners playing off in a final. In some other carnivals the format was a round-robin format, with a points system in which the team with most points at the end of the tournament was declared the winner.\nThe national football carnival was played under the State of Residence rules from 1908 to 1975, and then played under the State of Origin rules from 1979 to 1993.\n\nAustralian Rules State of Residence Matches (1904–2022)\nThe team names in bold indicate the winning teams.\n\nAustralian Rules State of Origin matches (1977–1999)\nThe team names in bold indicate the winning teams\nKey - 1979 Perth State of Origin Carnival:\n\nS1QPO = Section 1 Qualification Play Off\nS1SF1 = Section 1 Semi Final 1\nS1SF2 = Section 1 Semi Final 2\nS13PP = Section 1 3rd Place Playoff\nS1GF = Section 1 Grand Final\nS2GF = Section 2 Grand Final\nKey - 1980 Adelaide State of Origin Carnival:\n\nSF1 = Semi Final 1\nSF2 = Semi Final 2\n3PF = 3rd Place Final\nGF = Grand Final\nNote - 1980: Double-headers on the 11th of October and on the 13 of October respectively.\nNote - 1985: The match between South Australia and Victoria was awarded to South Australia on protest, as a result of Victoria playing with 4 interchange players instead of the permitted 3 interchange players.[3].\nKey - 1988 Adelaide Bicentennial Carnival:\n\nS1 SF = Section 1 Semi Final\nS1 3PPO = Section 1 3rd Place Play Off\nS1 GF = Section 1 Grand Final\nS2 PS = Section 2 Preliminary Stage\nS2 WSPO = Section 2 Wooden Spoon Play Off\nS2 GF = Section 2 Grand Final\nKey - 1993 State of Origin Championships:\n\nS1 SF1 = Section 1 Semi Final 1\nS1 SF2 = Section 1 Semi Final 2\nS1 GF = Section 1 Grand Final\nS2 GF = Section 2 Grand Final\n\nAFL Women's State of Origin (2017)\nAfter the success of the inaugural AFL Women's season the AFL announced in mid-July that a State of Origin representative match would be held for AFL Women's players during the AFL season pre-finals bye. A team of players born in Victoria played a single exhibition match against Allies (a team of players from the rest of Australia) at Etihad Stadium on the evening of Saturday 2 September.\n\nAFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match (2008)\nAFL State of Origin for Bushfire Relief Match (2020)\nOther interstate matches\nState league representative matches (1990–present)\nWith the advent of interstate teams into the expanding VFL and its eventual re-badging and change to a national league in 1990, the state leagues undertook steps to ensure that representative football would not be reserved solely for those players in the Australian Football League. State League Representative matches would allow those players participating in competitions that would be, in later years, categorised as second-tier leagues, to be selected for interstate duties. For the most part during the ensuing years between the inception of State League and the end of Origin, it was the South Australian and Western Australian leagues championing the concept with the two leagues facing off many times. The other state leagues did take part in the concept, but on a far more limited basis. The Queensland, ACT and Tasmanian competitions featured on several occasions, the New South Wales league made scattered appearances while the Northern Territory was far less featured on the interstate stage mainly due to their domestic league being played in a different part of the year. Meetings between those competitions and the SANFL or WAFL were a rare occurrence.\nThe Victorian Football Association eventually made some appearances of their own at state league level from 1994, but also did not have games against South Australia or Western Australia for a few years. Eventually, after a restructure of that competition in 1996 which saw them adopt the name of the VFL, they faced the SANFL on the MCG in the curtain raiser to what would be the swansong of State of Origin football in 1999. From this day onwards, interstate football would become the domain of the leagues that underpin the AFL. In the years following, the participation of the \"non-traditional\" football states was not as high as that of South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria. Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory continued to play a part, while Tasmania's football system was split in half between north and south, as well as the state team being replaced by a club—Tasmanian Devils—which entered the VFL in 2001. The \"Big 3\" in the SANFL, WAFL and VFL entered into an agreement in 2003 to adopt a program where they would play each other in a rotational system over three years, which saw one state either sit out interstate football for one season or require that league to find alternative opposition.\nTowards the end of the 2000s, the AFL by this time had control of the football administrations across the eastern states and the Northern Territory. Tasmania withdrew from the VFL and relaunched the statewide Tasmanian State League competition in 2009, then in 2011 the AFL created the North East Australian Football League out of established state league teams from New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland and the Northern Territory as well as reserves sides from the four AFL clubs in those regions. With this, the representative football calendar would virtually encompass all of Australia. At first the NEAFL's conference system would allow two representative sides with Queensland and the Northern Territory making up the Northern conference team and the New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory combination forming the Eastern conference side. A couple of years later, the NEAFL would be represented by a single team. How this arrangement fits into the individual state league schedules is still being worked on, but it has largely not disrupted the existing arrangements undertaken by the traditional football states. In fact, what would normally have been a \"bye\" year for the SANFL, WAFL or VFL allows them to instead play the NEAFL or the TSL.\nUnder this arrangement, the leagues of New South Wales (AFL Sydney), the Australian Capital Territory (AFL Canberra) and Queensland (QAFL) were effectivelly relegated to third-tier status behind the NEAFL and, as a result, any representative matches involving opposition outside of these territories have involved amateur-level leagues.\nThe state league representative matches, like State of Origin matches, also have individual best on ground medals:\n\nQueensland and Northern Territory (NEAFL North): Zane Taylor Medal\nSouth Australia (SANFL): Fos Williams Medal\nVictoria (VFA/VFL): Frank Johnson Medal\nWestern Australia (WAFL): Simpson Medal\nTasmania (TSL): Lefroy Medal\n\nResults\nBold text indicates the home team.\n\nIntrastate representative football\nE. J. Whitten Legends Game (1996–present)\nFollowing the death of Ted Whitten—who is regarded as one of the finest-ever players of Australian rules—from prostate cancer in 1995, his son Ted Whitten Jr organised an interstate charity match between teams of retired players to raise money for research into the disease. The only two teams which have taken part in these games are Victoria and the All-Stars (similar to the AFL's \"Allies\"), who represent the rest of Australia. The first E. J. Whitten Legends Game was played at Whitten Oval in 1996, and it has become an annual event. The games have often attracted crowds of over 10,000, and this has resulted in it being moved from the Whitten Oval to Optus Oval, to Adelaide Oval (South Australia) and finally to Etihad Stadium.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAustralianFootball.com, \"Interstate Football\"\nConvict Creations State of Origin\nAFL Statistics"

        "content": "Diane Keaton (née Hall; born January 5, 1946) is an American actress. She has received various accolades throughout her career spanning over five decades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and two Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for a Tony Award and two Emmy Awards. She was honored with the Film Society of Lincoln Center Gala Tribute in 2007 and an AFI Life Achievement Award in 2017.\nKeaton's career began on stage when she appeared in the original 1968 Broadway production of the musical Hair. The next year she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her performance in Woody Allen's comic play Play it Again, Sam. She then made her screen debut in a small role in Lovers and Other Strangers (1970), before rising to prominence with her first major film role as Kay Adams-Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972), a role she reprised in its sequels Part II (1974) and Part III (1990). She has frequently collaborated with Woody Allen, beginning with the film adaptation of Play It Again, Sam (1972). Her next two films with him, Sleeper (1973) and Love and Death (1975), established her as a comic actress, while her fourth, Annie Hall (1977), won her the Academy Award for Best Actress.\nTo avoid being typecast as her Annie Hall persona, Keaton appeared in several dramatic films, starring in Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) and Interiors (1978). She received three more Academy Award nominations for her roles as activist Louise Bryant in Reds (1981), a leukemia patient in Marvin's Room (1996), and a dramatist in Something's Gotta Give (2003). Keaton is also known for her starring roles in Manhattan (1979), Baby Boom (1987), Father of the Bride (1991), Father of the Bride Part II (1995), The First Wives Club (1996), The Family Stone (2005), Finding Dory (2016) and Book Club (2018).\n\nEarly life and education\nKeaton was born Diane Hall in Los Angeles, California on January 5, 1946. Her mother, Dorothy Deanne (née Keaton), was a homemaker and amateur photographer; her father, John Newton Ignatius \"Jack\" Hall, was a real estate broker and civil engineer, whose mother had come from Ireland. Keaton was raised a Free Methodist by her mother. Her mother won the \"Mrs. Los Angeles\" pageant for homemakers; Keaton has said that the theatricality of the event inspired her first impulse to be an actress, and led to her desire to work on stage. She has also credited Katharine Hepburn, whom she admires for playing strong and independent women, as one of her inspirations.\nKeaton is a 1964 graduate of Santa Ana High School in Santa Ana, California. During her time there, she participated in singing and acting clubs at school, and starred as Blanche DuBois in a school production of A Streetcar Named Desire. After graduation, she attended Santa Ana College, and later Orange Coast College as an acting student, but dropped out after a year to pursue an entertainment career in Manhattan. Upon joining the Actors' Equity Association, she changed her surname to Keaton, which was her mother's maiden name, as there was already an actress registered under the name of Diane Hall. For a brief time she also moonlighted at nightclubs with a singing act. She revisited her nightclub act in Annie Hall (1977), And So It Goes (2014), and a cameo in Radio Days (1987).\nKeaton began studying acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. She initially studied acting under the Meisner technique, an ensemble acting technique first evolved in the 1930s by Sanford Meisner, a New York stage actor/acting coach/director who had been a member of The Group Theater (1931–1940). She describes her acting technique as, \"[being] only as good as the person you're acting with ... As opposed to going it on my own and forging my path to create a wonderful performance without the help of anyone. I always need the help of everyone!\" According to fellow actor Jack Nicholson, \"She approaches a script sort of like a play in that she has the entire script memorized before you start doing the movie, which I don't know any other actors doing that.\"\n\nCareer\n1970s\nIn 1968, Keaton became an understudy for part of Sheila in the original Broadway production of Hair. She gained some notoriety for her refusal to disrobe at the end of Act I when the cast performs nude, even though nudity in the production was optional for actors (those who performed nude received a $50 bonus). After acting in Hair for nine months, she auditioned for a part in Woody Allen's production of Play It Again, Sam. After nearly being passed over for being too tall (at 5 ft 8 in (173 cm), she is 2 inches (5 cm) taller than Allen), she won the part. She went on to receive a Tony Award nomination for a Best Featured Actress in a Play for her performance in Play It Again, Sam.\n\nThe next year, Keaton made her film debut in Lovers and Other Strangers. She followed with guest roles on the television series Love, American Style, Night Gallery, and Mannix. Between films, Keaton appeared in a series of deodorant commercials.\nKeaton's breakthrough role came two years later when she was cast as Kay Adams, the girlfriend and eventual wife of Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) in Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 film The Godfather. Coppola noted that he first noticed Keaton in Lovers and Other Strangers, and cast her because of her reputation for eccentricity that he wanted her to bring to the role (Keaton claims that at the time she was commonly referred to as \"the kooky actress\" of the film industry). Her performance in the film was loosely based on her real-life experience of making the film, both of which she has described as being \"the woman in a world of men.\" The Godfather was an unparalleled critical and financial success, becoming the highest-grossing film of the year and winning the 1972 Academy Award for Best Picture.\nTwo years later, she reprised her role as Kay Adams in The Godfather Part II. She was initially reluctant, saying, \"At first, I was skeptical about playing Kay again in the Godfather sequel. But when I read the script, the character seemed much more substantial than in the first film.\" In Part II, her character changed dramatically, becoming more embittered about her husband's criminal empire. Even though Keaton received widespread exposure from the films, some critics felt that her character's importance was minimal. Time wrote that she was \"invisible in The Godfather and pallid in The Godfather Part II, but according to Empire magazine, Keaton \"proves the quiet lynchpin which is no mean feat in [the] necessarily male dominated films.\"\nKeaton's other notable films of the 1970s included many collaborations with Woody Allen. She played many eccentric characters in several of his comic and dramatic films, including Sleeper, Love and Death, Interiors, Manhattan, Manhattan Murder Mystery and the film version of Play It Again, Sam, directed by Herbert Ross. Allen has credited Keaton as his muse during his early film career.\nIn 1977, Keaton won the Academy Award for Best Actress for Allen's romantic comedy-drama Annie Hall, one of her most famous roles. Annie Hall, written by Allen and Marshall Brickman and directed by Allen, was believed by many to be an autobiographical exploration of his relationship with Keaton. Allen based the character of Annie Hall loosely on Keaton (\"Annie\" is a nickname of hers, and \"Hall\" is her original surname). Many of Keaton's mannerisms and her self-deprecating sense of humor were added into the role by Allen. (Director Nancy Meyers has claimed: \"Diane's the most self-deprecating person alive.\") Keaton has also said that Allen wrote the character as an \"idealized version\" of herself. The two starred as a frequently on-again, off-again couple living in New York City. Her acting was later summed up by CNN as \"awkward, self-deprecating, speaking in endearing little whirlwinds of semi-logic\", and by Allen as a \"nervous breakdown in slow motion.\" Annie Hall emerged as a major critical and commercial success and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Of Keaton's performance, feminist film critic Molly Haskell wrote, \"Keaton took me by surprise in Annie Hall. Here she blossomed into something more than just another kooky dame—she put the finishing touches on a type, the anti-goddess, the golden shiksa from the provinces who looks cool and together, who looks as if she must have a date on Saturday night, but has only to open her mouth or gulp or dart spastically sideways to reveal herself as the insecure bungler she is, as complete a social disaster in her own way as Allen's horny West Side intellectual is in his.\" In 2006, Premiere magazine ranked Keaton in Annie Hall 60th on its list of the \"100 Greatest Performances of All Time\", and noted:\n\nIt's hard to play ditzy. ... The genius of Annie is that despite her loopy backhand, awful driving, and nervous tics, she's also a complicated, intelligent woman. Keaton brilliantly displays this dichotomy of her character, especially when she yammers away on a first date with Alvy (Woody Allen), while the subtitle reads, 'He probably thinks I'm a yoyo.' Yo-yo? Hardly.\n\nKeaton's eccentric wardrobe in Annie Hall, which consisted mainly of vintage men's clothing, including neckties, vests, baggy pants, and fedora hats, made her an unlikely fashion icon of the late 1970s. A small amount of the clothing seen in the film came from Keaton herself, who was already known for her tomboyish clothing style years before Annie Hall, and Ruth Morley designed the film's costumes. Soon after the film's release, men's clothing and pantsuits became popular attire for women. She is known to favor men's vintage clothing, and usually appears in public wearing gloves and conservative attire. (A 2005 profile in the San Francisco Chronicle described her as \"easy to find. Look for the only woman in sight dressed in a turtleneck. On a 90-degree afternoon in Pasadena.\")\n\nHer photo by Douglas Kirkland appeared on the cover of the September 26, 1977, issue of Time magazine, with the story dubbing her \"the funniest woman now working in films.\" Later that year she departed from her usual lighthearted comic roles when she won the highly coveted lead role in the drama Looking for Mr. Goodbar, based on the novel by Judith Rossner. In the film, she played a Catholic schoolteacher for deaf children who lives a double life, spending nights frequenting singles bars and engaging in promiscuous sex. Keaton became interested in the role after seeing it as a \"psychological case history.\" The same issue of Time commended her role choice and criticized the restricted roles available for female actors in American films: A male actor can fly a plane, fight a war, shoot a badman, pull off a sting, impersonate a big cheese in business or politics. Men are presumed to be interesting. A female can play a wife, play a whore, get pregnant, lose her baby, and, um, let's see ... Women are presumed to be dull. ... Now a determined trend spotter can point to a handful of new films whose makers think that women can bear the dramatic weight of a production alone, or virtually so. Then there is Diane Keaton in Looking for Mr. Goodbar. As Theresa Dunn, Keaton dominates this raunchy, risky, violent dramatization of Judith Rossner's 1975 novel about a schoolteacher who cruises singles bars.\nIn addition to acting, Keaton has said she \"had a lifelong ambition to be a singer.\" She had a brief, unrealized career as a recording artist in the 1970s. Her first record was an original cast recording of Hair, in 1971. In 1977 she began recording tracks for a solo album, but the finished record never materialized.\nKeaton met with more success in the medium of still photography. Like her character in Annie Hall, Keaton had long relished photography as a favorite hobby, an interest she picked up as a teenager from her mother. While traveling in the late 1970s, she began exploring her avocation more seriously.\" Rolling Stone had asked me to take photographs for them, and I thought, 'Wait a minute, what I'm really interested in is these lobbies, and these strange ballrooms in these old hotels.' So I began shooting them\", she recalled in 2003. \"These places were deserted, and I could just sneak in anytime and nobody cared. It was so easy and I could do it myself. It was an adventure for me.\" Reservations, her collection of photos of hotel interiors, was published in book form in 1980.\n\n1980s\nWith Manhattan (1979), Keaton and Woody Allen ended their long working relationship; it was their last major collaboration until 1993. In 1978, she became romantically involved with Warren Beatty, and two years later he cast her opposite him in the epic historical drama Reds. In the film, she played Louise Bryant, a journalist and feminist, who flees her husband to work with radical journalist John Reed (Beatty) and later enters Russia to find him as he chronicles the Russian Civil War. Beatty cast Keaton after seeing her in Annie Hall, as he wanted to bring her natural nervousness and insecure attitude to the role. The production of Reds was delayed several times following its conception in 1977, and Keaton almost left the project when she believed it would never be produced. Filming finally began two years later. \n\nIn a 2006 Vanity Fair story, Keaton described her role as \"the everyman of that piece, as someone who wanted to be extraordinary but was probably more ordinary ... I knew what it felt like to be extremely insecure.\" Assistant director Simon Relph later stated that Louise Bryant was one of Keaton's most difficult roles, and that \"[she] almost got broken.\" Reds opened to widespread critical acclaim, and Keaton's performance was highly praised in particular. The New York Times wrote that Keaton was \"nothing less than splendid as Louise Bryant – beautiful, selfish, funny and driven. It's the best work she has done to date.\" Roger Ebert called Keaton \"a particular surprise. I had somehow gotten into the habit of expecting her to be a touchy New Yorker, sweet, scared, and intellectual. Here, she is just what she needs to be: plucky, healthy, exasperated, loyal, and funny.\" Keaton received her second Academy Award for Best Actress nomination for her performance.\nThe following year, Keaton starred in the domestic drama Shoot the Moon opposite Albert Finney. The film follows George (Finney) and Faith Dunlap (Keaton), whose deteriorating marriage, separation, and love affairs devastate their four children. Shoot the Moon received mostly positive reviews from critics and Keaton's performance was again praised. In The New Yorker, Pauline Kael wrote that the film was \"perhaps the most revealing American movie of the era\", and that Keaton \"may be a star without vanity: she's so completely challenged by the role of Faith that all she cares about is getting the character right. Very few young American movie actresses have the strength and the instinct for the toughest dramatic roles—intelligent, sophisticated heroines. Jane Fonda did, around the time that she appeared in Klute and They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, but that was more than ten years ago. There hasn't been anybody else until now. Diane Keaton acts on a different plane from that of her previous film roles; she brings the character a full measure of dread and awareness and does it in a special, intuitive way that's right for screen acting.\" David Denby of New York magazine called Keaton \"perfectly relaxed and self-assured\", adding, \"Keaton has always found it easy enough to bring out the anger that lies beneath the soft hesitancy of her surface manner, but she's never dug down and found this much pain before. Keaton's performance garnered her a second Golden Globe nomination in a row for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, following Reds.\n1984 brought The Little Drummer Girl, Keaton's first excursion into the thriller and action genre. The Little Drummer Girl was both a financial and critical failure, with critics claiming that Keaton was miscast for the genre, such as one review from The New Republic claiming that \"the title role, the pivotal role, is played by Diane Keaton, and around her the picture collapses in tatters. She is so feeble, so inappropriate.\" But the same year, she received positive reviews for her performance in Mrs. Soffel, a film based on the true story of a repressed prison warden's wife who falls in love with a convicted murderer and arranges for his escape. Two years later, she starred with Jessica Lange and Sissy Spacek in Crimes of the Heart, adapted from Beth Henley's Pulitzer Prize-winning play into a moderately successful screen comedy. Keaton's performance was well received by critics, and Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote, \"As the frumpy Lenny, Keaton eases smoothly from New York neurotic to southern eccentric, a reluctant wallflower stymied by, of all things, her shriveled ovary.\"\nIn 1987, Keaton starred in Baby Boom, her first of four collaborations with writer-producer Nancy Meyers. She played a Manhattan career woman who is suddenly forced to care for a toddler. A modest box-office success, Keaton's performance was singled out by Kael, who described it as \"a glorious comedy performance that rides over many of the inanities in this picture. Keaton is smashing: the Tiger Lady's having all this drive is played for farce and Keaton keeps you alert to every shade of pride and panic the character feels. She's an ultra-feminine executive, a wide-eyed charmer, with a breathless ditziness that may remind you of Jean Arthur in The More The Merrier.\" That same year, Keaton made a cameo in Allen's film Radio Days as a nightclub singer. 1988's The Good Mother was a financial disappointment (according to Keaton, the film was \"a Big Failure. Like, BIG failure\"), and some critics panned her performance; according to The Washington Post, \"her acting degenerates into hype—as if she's trying to sell an idea she can't fully believe in.\"\nIn 1987, Keaton directed and edited her first feature film, Heaven, a documentary about the possibility of an afterlife. It met with mixed critical reaction, with The New York Times likening it to \"a conceit imposed on its subjects.\" Over the next four years, Keaton directed music videos for artists such as Belinda Carlisle, including the video for Carlisle's chart-topping hit \"Heaven Is a Place on Earth,\" two television films starring Patricia Arquette, and episodes of the series China Beach and Twin Peaks.\n\n1990s\nBy the 1990s, Keaton had established herself as one of the most popular and versatile actors in Hollywood. She shifted to more mature roles, frequently playing matriarchs of middle-class families. Of her role choices and avoidance of becoming typecast, she said: \"Most often a particular role does you some good and Bang! You have loads of offers, all of them for similar roles ... I have tried to break away from the usual roles and have tried my hand at several things.\"\nKeaton began the decade with The Lemon Sisters, a poorly-received comedy-drama that she starred in and produced, which was shelved for a year after its completion. In 1991 she starred with Steve Martin in the family comedy Father of the Bride. She was almost not cast in the film, as The Good Mother's commercial failure had strained her relationship with Walt Disney Pictures, the studio of both films. Father of the Bride was Keaton's first major hit after four years of commercial disappointments. She reprised her role four years later in the sequel, as a woman who becomes pregnant in middle age at the same time as her daughter. A San Francisco Examiner review of the film was one of many in which Keaton was once again compared to Katharine Hepburn: \"No longer relying on that stuttering uncertainty that seeped into all her characterizations of the 1970s, she has somehow become Katharine Hepburn with a deep maternal instinct, that is, she is a fine and intelligent actress who doesn't need to be tough and edgy in order to prove her feminism.\"\nKeaton reprised her role of Kay Adams in 1990's The Godfather Part III, set 20 years after the end of The Godfather, Part II. In 1993 Keaton starred in black comedy mystery Manhattan Murder Mystery, her first major film role in a Woody Allen film since 1979. Her part was originally intended for Mia Farrow, but Farrow dropped out of the project after breaking up with Allen. Todd McCarthy of Variety commended her performance, writing that she \"nicely handles her sometimes buffoonish central comedic role\". David Ansen of Newsweek wrote, \"On screen, Keaton and Allen have always been made for each other: they still strike wonderfully ditsy sparks\". For her performance, Keaton was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.\nIn 1995, Keaton directed Unstrung Heroes, her first theatrically released narrative film. The film, adapted from Franz Lidz's memoir, starred Nathan Watt as a boy in the 1960s whose mother (Andie MacDowell) is diagnosed with cancer. As her sickness advances and his inventor father (John Turturro) grows increasingly distant, the boy is sent to live with his two eccentric uncles (Maury Chaykin and Michael Richards). Keaton switched the story's setting from the New York of Lidz's book to the Southern California of her own childhood, and the four mad uncles were reduced to a whimsical odd couple. In an essay for The New York Times, Lidz said that the cinematic Selma had died not of cancer, but of \"Old Movie Disease\". \"Someday somebody may find a cure for cancer, but the terminal sappiness of cancer movies is probably beyond remedy.\" Unstrung Heroes played in a relatively limited release and made little impression at the box office, but the film and its direction were generally well-received critically.\nKeaton's most successful film of the decade was the 1996 comedy The First Wives Club. She starred with Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler as a trio of \"first wives\": middle-aged women who had been divorced by their husbands in favor of younger women. Keaton claimed that making the film \"saved [her] life.\" The film was a major success, grossing US$105 million at the North American box office, and it developed a cult following among middle-aged women. Its reviews were generally positive for Keaton and her co-stars, and The San Francisco Chronicle called her \"probably [one of] the best comic film actresses alive.\" In 1997 Keaton, Hawn and Midler received the Women in Film Crystal Award, which honors \"outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.\"\nAlso in 1996, Keaton starred as Bessie, a woman with leukemia, in Marvin's Room, an adaptation of the play by Scott McPherson. Meryl Streep played her estranged sister, Lee, and had also initially been considered for the role of Bessie. The film also starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Lee's rebellious son. Roger Ebert wrote, \"Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into much more than the expression of their problems.\" Keaton earned a third Academy Award nomination for the film, which was critically acclaimed. She said the role's biggest challenge was understanding the mentality of a person with a terminal illness. Keaton next starred in The Only Thrill (1997) opposite her Baby Boom co-star Sam Shephard, and had a supporting role in The Other Sister (1999).\nIn 1999, Keaton narrated the one-hour public radio documentary \"If I Get Out Alive\", the first to focus on the conditions and brutality young people face in the adult correctional system. The program, produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media, aired on public radio stations across the country and was honored with a First Place National Headliner Award and a Casey Medal for Meritorious Journalism.\n\n2000s\nKeaton's first film of 2000 was Hanging Up, with Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow. She directed the film, despite claiming in a 1996 interview that she would never direct herself in a film, saying \"as a director, you automatically have different goals. I can't think about directing when I'm acting.\" A drama about three sisters coping with the senility and eventual death of their elderly father (Walter Matthau), Hanging Up rated poorly with critics and grossed a modest US$36 million at the North American box office.\nIn 2001, Keaton co-starred with Beatty in Town & Country, a critical and financial fiasco. Budgeted at an estimated US$90 million, the film opened to little notice and grossed only US$7 million in its North American theatrical run. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that Town & Country was \"less deserving of a review than it is an obituary....The corpse took with it the reputations of its starry cast, including Beatty and Keaton.\" In 2001 and 2002, Keaton starred in four low-budget television films. She played a fanatical nun in the religious drama Sister Mary Explains It All, an impoverished mother in the drama On Thin Ice, and a bookkeeper in the mob comedy Plan B. In Crossed Over, she played Beverly Lowry, a woman who forms an unusual friendship with the only woman executed while on death row in Texas, Karla Faye Tucker.\n\nKeaton's first major hit since 1996 came in 2003's romantic comedy Something's Gotta Give, directed by Nancy Meyers and co-starring Jack Nicholson. Nicholson and Keaton, aged 65 and 56 respectively, were seen as bold casting choices for leads in a romantic comedy. Twentieth Century Fox, the film's original studio, reportedly declined to produce the film, fearing that the lead characters were too old to be bankable. Keaton told Ladies' Home Journal, \"Let's face it, people my age and Jack's age are much deeper, much more soulful, because they've seen a lot of life. They have a great deal of passion and hope—why shouldn't they fall in love? Why shouldn't movies show that?\" Keaton played a middle-aged playwright who falls in love with her daughter's much older boyfriend. The film was a major success at the box office, grossing US$125 million in North America. Roger Ebert wrote, \"Keaton and Nicholson bring so much experience, knowledge and humor to their characters that the film works in ways the screenplay might not have even hoped for.\" Keaton received her fourth Academy Award nomination for her performance.\nKeaton's only film between 2004 and 2006 was the comedy The Family Stone (2005), starring an ensemble cast. In the film, scripted and directed by Thomas Bezucha, Keaton played a breast cancer survivor and matriarch of a big New England family that reunites at the parents' home for its annual Christmas holidays. The film released to moderate critical and commercial success, and earned US$92.2 million worldwide. Keaton received her second Satellite Award nomination for her performance, of which Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, \"Keaton, a sorceress at blending humor and heartbreak, honors the film with a grace that makes it stick in the memory.\"\nIn 2007, Keaton starred in both Because I Said So and Mama's Boy. In the romantic comedy Because I Said So, directed by Michael Lehmann, Keaton played a long-divorced mother of three daughters, determined to pair off her only single daughter, Milly (Mandy Moore). Also starring Stephen Collins and Gabriel Macht, the project opened to overwhelmingly negative reviews, with Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe calling it \"a sloppily made bowl of reheated chick-flick cliches\", and was ranked among the worst-reviewed films of the year. The following year Keaton received her first and only Golden Raspberry Award nomination to date for the film. In Mama's Boy, director Tim Hamilton's feature film debut, Keaton starred as the mother of a self-absorbed 29-year-old (Jon Heder) whose world turns upside down when she starts dating and considers kicking him out of the house. Distributed for a limited release to certain parts of the United States only, the independent comedy garnered largely negative reviews.\nIn 2008, Keaton starred alongside Dax Shepard and Liv Tyler in Vince Di Meglio's dramedy Smother, playing the overbearing mother of an unemployed therapist, who decides to move in with him and his girlfriend after breaking up with her husband (Ken Howard). As with Mama's Boy, the film received a limited release only, resulting in a gross of US$1.8 million worldwide. Critical reaction to the film was generally unfavorable. Also in 2008, Keaton appeared alongside Katie Holmes and Queen Latifah in the crime-comedy film Mad Money, directed by Callie Khouri. Based on the British television drama Hot Money (2001), the film revolves around three female employees of the Federal Reserve who scheme to steal money that is about to be destroyed.\n\n2010s\nIn 2010, Keaton starred alongside Rachel McAdams and Harrison Ford in Roger Michell's comedy Morning Glory, playing the veteran TV host of a fictional morning talk show that desperately needs to boost its lagging ratings. Portraying a narcissistic character who will do anything to please the audience, Keaton described her role as \"the kind of woman you love to hate.\" Inspired by Neil Simon's 1972 Broadway play The Sunshine Boys, the film was a moderate success at the box office, taking a worldwide total of almost US$59 million. Keaton was generally praised for her performance, with James Berardinelli of ReelViews writing, \"Keaton is so good at her part that one can see her sliding effortlessly into an anchor's chair on a real morning show.\"\n\nIn fall 2010, Keaton joined the production of the comedy-drama Darling Companion by Lawrence Kasdan, which was released in 2012. Co-starring Kevin Kline and Dianne Wiest and set in Telluride, Colorado, the film follows a woman, played by Keaton, whose husband loses her much-beloved dog at a wedding held at their vacation home in the Rocky Mountains, resulting in a search party to find the pet. Kasdan's first film in nine years, the film bombed at the US box office, where it scored about US$790,000 throughout its entire theatrical run. Critics dismissed the film as \"an overwritten, underplotted vanity project\" but applauded Keaton's performance. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe wrote that the film \"would be instantly forgettable if not for Keaton, who imbues [her role] with a sorrow, warmth, wisdom, and rage that feel earned [...] Her performance here is an extension of worn, resilient grace.\"\nAlso in 2011, Keaton began production on Justin Zackham's 2013 ensemble family comedy The Big Wedding, a remake of the 2006 French film Mon frère se marie in which she, along with Robert De Niro, played a long-divorced couple who, for the sake of their adopted son's wedding and his very religious biological mother, pretend they are still married. The film received largely negative reviews.\nIn 2014, Keaton starred in And So It Goes and 5 Flights Up. In Rob Reiner's romantic dramedy And So It Goes, Keaton portrayed a widowed lounge singer who finds autumnal love with a bad boy (Michael Douglas). The film received largely negative reviews. One critic wrote that \"And So It Goes aims for comedy, but with two talented actors stuck in a half-hearted effort from a once-mighty filmmaker, it ends in unintentional tragedy.\" Keaton co-starred with Morgan Freeman in Richard Loncraine's comedy-drama 5 Flights Up, based on Jill Ciment's novel Heroic Measures. They play a long-married couple who have an eventful weekend after they are forced to contemplate selling their beloved Brooklyn apartment. Shot in New York, the film premiered, under its former name Ruth & Alex, at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. The same year Keaton became the first woman to receive the Golden Lion Award at the Zurich Film Festival.\nKeaton's only film of 2015 was Love the Coopers, an ensemble comedy about a troubled family getting together for Christmas, for which she reunited with Because I Said So writer Jessie Nelson. Also starring John Goodman, Ed Helms, and Marisa Tomei, Keaton was attached for several years before the film went into production. Her casting was instrumental in financing and recruiting most other actors, which led her to an executive producer credit in the film. Love the Coopers received largely negative reviews from critics, who called it a \"bittersweet blend of holiday cheer\", and became a moderate commercial success at a worldwide total of US$41.1 million against a budget of US$17 million. Also in 2015 Netflix announced the comedy Divanation, for which Keaton was expected to reunite with her First Wives Club co-stars Midler and Hawn to portray a former singing group, but the project failed to materialize.\nKeaton voiced amnesiac fish Dory's mother in Disney and Pixar's Finding Dory (2016), the sequel to the 2003 Pixar animated film Finding Nemo. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over US$1 billion worldwide, the second Pixar film to cross this mark after Toy Story 3 (2010). It also set numerous records, including the biggest animated opening of all time in North America, emerging as the biggest animated film of all time in the US. Keaton's other project of 2016 was the HBO eight-part series The Young Pope, in which she plays a nun who raised the newly elected Pope (Jude Law) and helped him reach the papacy. The miniseries received two nominations for the 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first Italian TV series to be nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards.\nIn 2017, Keaton appeared opposite Brendan Gleeson in the British dramedy film Hampstead. Based on the life of Harry Hallowes, it depicts an American widow (Keaton) who helps a local man defending his ramshackle hut and the life he has been leading on Hampstead Heath for 17 years. The specialty release had a mixed reception from critics, who were unimpressed by the film's \"deeply mediocre story\", but became a minor commercial success. Keaton's only project of 2018 was Book Club, in which she, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen play four friends who read Fifty Shades of Grey as part of their monthly book club and subsequently begin to change how they view their personal relationships. The romantic comedy received mixed reviews from critics, who felt that Book Club only \"intermittently rises to the level of its impressive veteran cast,\" but with a worldwide gross of over $100 million, became Keaton's biggest commercial success in a non-voice role since 2003's Something's Gotta Give. In 2019, Keaton starred in the comedy Poms as a woman dying of cancer who starts a cheerleading squad with other female residents of a retirement home. The film was a box office disappointment and was negatively received by critics.\n\nPersonal life\nRelationships and family\nKeaton has had romantic associations with several entertainment industry personalities, starting with director Woody Allen during her role in the 1969 Broadway production of Play It Again, Sam. Their relationship turned romantic following a dinner after a late-night rehearsal. It was her sense of humor that attracted Allen. They briefly lived together during the production, but by the time of the film release of the same name in 1972, their living arrangement became informal. They worked together on eight films between 1971 and 1993, and Keaton has said that Allen remains one of her closest friends.\nKeaton also had a relationship with her Godfather Trilogy costar Al Pacino. Their on-again, off-again relationship ended after the filming of The Godfather Part III. Keaton said of Pacino, \"Al was simply the most entertaining man... To me, that's, that is the most beautiful face. I think Warren [Beatty] was gorgeous, very pretty, but Al's face is like whoa. Killer, killer face.\"\nKeaton was already dating Warren Beatty in 1979 when they co-starred in the film Reds (1981). Beatty was a regular subject in tabloid magazines and media coverage, and Keaton became included, much to her bewilderment. In 1985, Vanity Fair called her \"the most reclusive star since Garbo.\" This relationship ended shortly after Reds wrapped. Troubles with the production are thought to have strained the relationship, including numerous financial and scheduling problems. Keaton remains friends with Beatty.\nIn July 2001, Keaton said of being older and unmarried, \"I don't think that because I'm not married it's made my life any less. That old maid myth is garbage.\" Keaton has two adopted children, daughter Dexter (adopted 1996) and son Duke (adopted 2001). Her father's death made mortality more apparent to her, and she decided to become a mother at age 50. She later said of having children, \"Motherhood has completely changed me. It's just about like the most completely humbling experience that I've ever had.\"\n\nReligious beliefs\nKeaton said she produced her 1987 documentary Heaven because \"I was always pretty religious as a kid ... I was primarily interested in religion because I wanted to go to heaven.\" When she grew up, she became agnostic.\n\nOther activities\nKeaton has been a vegetarian since around 1995. She has continued to pursue photography. In 1987, she told Vanity Fair, \"I have amassed a huge library of images—kissing scenes from movies, pictures I like. Visual things are really key for me.\" She has published several collections of her photographs and served as an editor of collections of vintage photography. Works she has edited include a book of photographs by paparazzo Ron Galella, an anthology of reproductions of clown paintings, and a collection of photos of California's Spanish-Colonial-style houses.\nKeaton has served as a producer on films and television series. She produced the Fox series Pasadena, which was canceled after airing only four episodes in 2001 but completed its run on cable in 2005. In 2003, she produced the Gus Van Sant drama Elephant, about a school shooting. Of why she produced the film, she said, \"It really makes me think about my responsibilities as an adult to try and understand what's going on with young people.\"\nSince 2005, Keaton has been a contributing blogger at The Huffington Post. Since 2006, she has been the face of L'Oréal. In 2007, Keaton received the Film Society of Lincoln Center's Gala Tribute. She opposes plastic surgery. She told More magazine in 2004, \"I'm stuck in this idea that I need to be authentic ... My face needs to look the way I feel.\" \nKeaton is active in campaigns with the Los Angeles Conservancy to save and restore historic buildings, particularly in the Los Angeles area. Among the buildings she has been active in restoring is the Ennis House in the Hollywood Hills, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Keaton was also active in the failed campaign to save the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles (a hotel featured in Reservations), where Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated. She is an enthusiast of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture.\nKeaton has also been a real estate developer. She has resold several mansions in Southern California after renovating and redesigning them. One of her clients was Madonna, who purchased a $6.5 million Beverly Hills mansion from Keaton in 2003.\nKeaton wrote her first memoir, Then Again, for Random House in November 2011. Much of it relies on her mother's private journals, which include the line \"Diane...is a mystery...At times, she's so basic, at others so wise, it frightens me.\" In 2012, Keaton's audiobook recording of Joan Didion's Slouching Towards Bethlehem was released on Audible.com. Her performance was nominated for a 2013 Audie Award in the Short Stories/Collections category.\n\nActing style and legacy\nKeaton has been called \"one of the great American actresses from the heyday of the 1970s\", a style icon and a \"treasure\" with a personal and professional style that is \"difficult to explicate and impossible to duplicate.\" Many critics have pointed to her versatility in starring in both light comedies and acclaimed dramas. The New York Times described Keaton as \"remarkably skilled\" at portraying Woody Allen's \"darling flustered muse\" in his comedies, as well as \"shy, self-conscious women overcome by the power of their own awakened eroticism\" in dramatic films like Looking for Mr. Goodbar, Reds, Shoot the Moon and Mrs. Soffel. It also noted Keaton's ability to consistently reinvent and challenge herself on screen, having transitioned from \"Allen's ditzy foil\" to a \"gifted and erotically nuanced character actress\" and later \"an appealing maternal figure... a woman's woman with a sexy edge.\"\nLiterary critic Daphne Merkin argued that Keaton remained more popular with audiences than her contemporaries because of her \"friendly accessibility\" and \"charmingly self-effacing\" persona, calling Keaton's most \"steadfastly glamorous\" asset her \"megawatt personality, bursting out of her like an uncontrollable force of nature, a geyser of quirkily entertaining traits that fall on the air and lend everything around her a momentary sparkle.\" In New York magazine, Peter Rainer wrote, \"In her Annie Hall days, [Keaton] was famed for her thrown-together fashion sense, and her approach to acting is, in the best way, thrown-together, too. Audiences love her because they identify with the women she plays, who are never all of a piece. Nobody can be grave and goofy all at once like Diane Keaton. In these fractious times, it's the perfect combo for a modern heroine.\" Famously self-deprecating, Keaton has been noted for her \"wry sense of humor\" and \"eccentric gender-bending style.\"\nAnalyzing her on-screen persona, Deborah C. Mitchell wrote that Keaton often played \"a complex, modern American woman, a paradox of self-doubt and assurance\", which became her trademark. Mitchell suggests that Keaton made Annie Hall a \"critical juncture for women in American culture. In this ism-infected age, Keaton became not just a star but an icon. Annie Hall, and with her Diane Keaton, presented all of the uncertainty and ambivalence of the new breed of women.\" Likewise, Bruce Weber felt Keaton's eccentricity—\"an amalgam of caginess and insecurity\" and a \"note of comic desperation... her round-cheeked Annie Hall dewiness\"—was her gift as a screen comedian. Keaton's Annie Hall is often cited among the greatest Oscar-winning performances in history: Entertainment Weekly ranked it 7th on its \"25 greatest Best Actress Winners\" list, praising her \"loopy mannerisms, jazz-club serenades, and endlessly imitated fashion sense.\" After seeing her performance in Looking for Mr. Goodbar, Andrew Sarris remarked, \"Keaton is clearly the most dynamic woman star in pictures. And any actress who can bring wit and humor to sex in an American movie has to be blessed with the most winning magic.\"\nWhen asked what made Keaton funny, Allen said: \"My opinion is that with the exception of Judy Holliday, she's the finest screen comedienne we've ever seen. It's in her intonation; you can't quantify it easily. When Groucho Marx or W.C. Fields or Holliday would say something, it's in the ring of their voices, and she has that. It's never line comedy with her. It's all character comedy.\" Charles Shyer, who directed her in Baby Boom, said Keaton was \"in the mold of the iconic comedic actresses Carole Lombard, Irene Dunne and Rosalind Russell.\" In 2017 Keaton was chosen by the board of directors of the American Film Institute to receive the AFI Life Achievement Award, which Woody Allen presented.\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nMusic videos\nAwards and honors\nKeaton has received various awards, including an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award for her performance in Woody Allen's Annie Hall (1977). She also received three more Academy Award nominations, for Reds (1981), Marvin's Room (1996), and Something's Gotta Give (2003). Keaton received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Amelia Earhart: The Final Flight (1994) and a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for CBS Schoolbreak Special in 1990. Keaton has received 12 Golden Globe Award nominations, winning for Annie Hall (1977) and Something's Gotta Give (2003). She has received four Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for her work in film and television.\nOver the years Keaton has been received various honors for her work as an actress and fashion icon. In 1991, she received the Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year award from Harvard's Hasty Pudding Theatricals, which is given to performers who give a lasting and impressive contribution to the world of entertainment. In 1995, she was honored by the New York Women in Film & Television association along with Angela Bassett, Cokie Roberts, Gena Rowlands and Thelma Schoonmaker. In 1996 she won the Golden Apple Award as the Female Star of the Year, sharing it with her First Wives Club co-stars Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler. She also received the 1997 Crystal Award at the Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards in 1997, and the Elle Women in Hollywood Awards the Icon Award in 1998 along with Sigourney Weaver, Lucy Fisher and Gillian Armstrong.\nKeaton won the 2004 AFI Star Award during the US Comedy Arts Festival. In 2005, she received a Lifetime Achievement award from the Hollywood Film Awards. She was honored with the Film Society of Lincoln Center Gala Tribute in 2007. In 2014 she received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Manaki Brothers Film Festival. That year she also received the Golden Icon Award at the Zurich Film Festival. In 2017 she was honored by the American Film Institute and was given a Lifetime Achievement Award, which was presented to her by her close friend and frequent collaborator Woody Allen. Other who paid tribute to her included Steve Martin, Martin Short, Meryl Streep, Reese Witherspoon, Emma Stone, Rachel McAdams, Morgan Freeman, and Al Pacino. In 2018 she received a Special David at the David di Donatello Awards.\n\nBibliography\nAs writer\nThen Again, New York: Random House, 2011, ISBN 9781400068784\nLet's Just Say It Wasn't Pretty, New York: Random House, 2014, ISBN 9780812994261\nBrother & Sister, New York: Random House, 2020 ISBN 9780451494504\nFashion First , with Ralph Lauren, Rizzoli 2024 ISBN 9780847827817\n\nAs photographer\nReservations, New York: Knopf, 1980, ISBN 0394508424\nSaved, New York: Rizzoli, 2022, ISBN 0847871282\n\nAs editor\nStill Life (with Marvin Heiferman), New York: Callaway, 1983, ISBN 0935112162\nMr. Salesman, Santa Fe: Twin Palms Publishers, 1993, ISBN 0944092268\nLocal News (with Marvin Heiferman), New York: D.A.P./Distributed Art Publishers, Inc., 1999, ISBN 1891024132\nClown Paintings, New York: powerHouse Books, 2002, ISBN 1576871487\nCalifornia Romantica, New York: Rizzoli, 2007, ISBN 0847829758\nHouse, New York: Rizzoli, 2012, ISBN 9780847835638\n\nReferences\nWorks cited\nLax, Eric.

He was a part of the Cronulla team that won their maiden premiership title in the 2016 season, scoring the equalising try that led to the game winning conversion from James Maloney.\n\nEarly years\nFifita was born in Blacktown, New South Wales, Australia, of Indigenous Australian and Tongan descent. Andrew Fifita's twin brother, David Fifita played for the Wakefield Trinity as a prop.\nFifita began playing rugby league with twin brother David in the Penrith junior rugby league system before moving to Griffith, New South Wales. He attended Patrician Brothers' College, Blacktown and Wyndham College. He played junior football for the Doonside Roos, St Patricks Blacktown and the Griffith Waratahs.\nAs a teenager, Fifita trialled with the Sydney Roosters and the North Sydney Bears, but was considered lightweight, even though he was playing as a winger or centre at the time. Fifita said he, \"tried eating and all that stuff but it didn't work and then one day I just blew out. It wasn't until I was 17 or 18 that I put the size on. Maybe it was the grog, I don't know. I was seriously pushing to get to 80 kg back then. I think I was about 70 kg.\" Fifita would eventually sign with the Wests Tigers and later played in their NYC team in 2009, including playing at prop in the 2009 NYC Grand Final against the Melbourne Storm in the 22–24 loss.\nHis twin brother David also played lower-grade for the Tigers. Fifita is not related to John Fifita, a former St George Dragons player. Fifita's elder brother Latu Fifita played for Workington Town in the Kingstone Press Championship.\n\nPlaying career\n2010\nIn round 2, Fifita made his first grade debut for the Wests Tigers against Sydney Roosters, coming off the interchange bench where he scored a try in the 44–32 loss at the Sydney Football Stadium.

On 25 October, Fifita made his international debut for Tonga, starting at prop in the 6–22 loss against Samoa at Parramatta Stadium. Fifita commented after match saying, \"It was a good experience, it's not about the loss here, it's about the experience and about looking forward to the future for the World Cup and the years ahead.\"\n\n2011\nFifita was chosen to participate in a New South Wales developmental squad. In the off-season he had dropped about 10 kilos to be playing at about 109 kg. Fifita started the season at prop, but was dropped from first grade by Tim Sheens after round 19 and never returned. \"I was always saying, 'Let me play, let me play,'\" Fifita said. \"But he just said go to NSW Cup. I was pulling 80 minutes each game there, what can you do? You're up against the coach. You can't say anything. At the end I had kind of given up. I thought there was no more first grade for me.\" \n\nOn 15 July, Fifita signed with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks on a 3-year deal, starting from 2012 after was released from the Wests Tigers, along with Bryce Gibbs, so that the club could accommodate Adam Blair under the salary cap. Fifita finished his last year with the Wests Tigers with 3 tries in 17 matches.\n\n2012\nOn 9 February, Fifita played for the Indigenous All Stars against the NRL All Stars, starting at prop in the 28–36 loss. In round 1, Fifita made his debut for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks against his former club, the Wests Tigers, playing off the interchange bench in the 16–17 loss at Leichhardt Oval. In round 4, against the North Queensland Cowboys, Fifita scored his first club try for the Sharks in the 20–14 win at 1300SMILES Stadium. With the Sharks starting 2012 well, and with his old club struggling to win early games, Fifita commented, \"We have an unbelievable bond. We're so tight. Compared to the Tigers everyone is so tight. We have the same dressing rooms. It's just more of a friendship. We're all just brothers and it's no split groups, no nothing, it's who we are.\" Fifita finished his first year with the Sharks with him playing in 22 matches and scoring 5 tries.\n\n2013\nOn 9 February, Fifita played for the Indigenous All Stars against the NRL All Stars, starting at prop in the 32–6 win.

On 21 April, he played for City Origin against the NSW Country Origin side, where he played off the interchange bench and scored a try in the 12–18 loss. On 5 June, Fifita made his State of Origin debut for New South Wales against Queensland, where he played off the interchange bench in the Blues 14–6 win at ANZ Stadium.

During the tournament, Fifita played in 6 matches and scored 2 tries for Australia, including playing off the interchange bench in the Kangaroos 34-2 World Cup win over New Zealand at Old Trafford.\n\n2014\nOn 11 March, Fifita signed a four-year contract worth more than $800,000 a season to play with the Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs. On 31 March, Fifita's contract with the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs was terminated. A statement from the Bulldogs stated that they had advised Fifita's management that he would not be playing for the club \"given the final terms of the NRL Playing Contract could not be agreed\".  Canterbury's management team were also reportedly upset with Fifita's comments days after signing with the club saying that \"He wished he joined Rugby Union instead\" and that his \"heart was still with Cronulla\". On 26 April, Fifita re-signed with Cronulla on a four-year deal until the end of the 2018 season. Fifita later made public the terms of the memorandum of understanding he had signed, which stated he would be paid $800,000 per season. When the official contract was received 17 days later, the figures were much lower, and only offered $375,000 for the first season. On 4 May, Fifita played for City against Country where he scored a try in the 26-all draw. In round 9, against the Parramatta Eels, Fifita suffered an ankle injury. The injury resulted in Fifita missing the 2014 State of Origin series, and a big chunk of the NRL season. Fifita returned in round 18, against the Newcastle Knights. In round 22, against the New Zealand Warriors, Fifita suffered a broken arm which ended his season. Fifita played in 12 matches during his tumultuous heavily publicised 2014 NRL season.\nOn 17 August, Fifita was involved in a road rage incident at Taren Point where he allegedly threw an object at a car travelling behind him and later after the pair pulled over, Fifita allegedly got out of his Jeep and verbally abused the 23-year-old male driver of the Subaru before punching and kicking the panels of his car.\n\n2015\nIn round 2, against the Brisbane Broncos, Fifita played his 100th career match in the Sharks 2–10 loss at Shark Park. On 3 May, he played for City Origin in the 22–34 loss in Wagga Wagga. Fifita's good form in the early rounds of the season earned him a spot back into the New South Wales Blues team, where he played in game 1 of the series, coming off the interchange bench in the Blues 10–11 loss at ANZ Stadium. He wasn't selected for games 2 or 3.\nOn 6 August, Fifita and his twin brother David were given 6-week suspensions and a $30,000 fine after they abused a referee at a junior match in Penrith. The pair allegedly abused the referee because a player in the team they were helping out, St Patrick's Blacktown, was injured in back play and the referee didn't stop the match. During the suspension, on an episode of The Footy Show, Fifita discussed how he had suffered severe depression in October 2014 and attempted suicide by trying to hurl himself out of a 20th story window at a holiday resort at Surfers Paradise after a drunken night out with his brothers and friends celebrating a friend's bucks night. Fifita revealed that he had been saved when someone in the room grabbed his legs and pulled him back inside and said \"David punched me in the face, punched me in the mouth, I sat there laughing at him\", I was just yelling at him 'I don't care: it's over, do what you want.' Life was over for me at that point.\" Fifita had become suicidal amid the pressures of his team's poor results, a personal form slump and complications involving his contract. Following the incident, Andrew's brother David forced him to seek psychiatric help after which he received treatment for depression and a personality disorder. After his suspension was over, Fifita returned for the Sharks in their elimination finals match against the reigning premiers the South Sydney Rabbitohs, where he played off the interchange bench in the Sharks 28–12 win. Fifita finished the year with him playing in 18 matches and scoring 7 tries for the Sharks.\n\n2016\nOn 13 February, Fifita played for the Indigenous All Stars against the World All Stars, starting at prop in the 12–8 loss at Suncorp Stadium.  In September 2016, sports journalist Rebecca Wilson called for Fifita to be terminated by Cronulla after the player had visited convicted killer Kieran Loveridge in prison.  Wilson later said that Fifita had no place in rugby league.\nOn 2 October, Fifita played for Cronulla-Sutherland against the Melbourne Storm in the 2016 NRL Grand Final, which Cronulla won 14–12 at ANZ Stadium in Sydney. He scored the winning try with ten minutes to go in the game, carrying several defenders over the line with him. His efforts in the 2016 season saw him co-winner of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks Player of the Year trophy at the clubs annual season awards night. On 13 December 2016, Fifita was handed a breach notice by The NRL for showing support for childhood friend, one punch killer Kieran Loveridge. Fifita attempted to reach out to the family of Thomas Kelly and was dismayed at how the incident was received.\nOn seven occasions Fifita was photographed playing with the message on his wrist during the Cronulla's premiership drought-breaking campaign. On 21 December 2016, Fifita was fined $20,000 by The NRL over his continued support for Loveridge.\n\n2017\nOn 31 May 2017, Fifita played for the New South Wales Blues in game 1 of the 2017 State of Origin series and was instrumental in the team's 28–4 win over the Queensland Maroons. He fended multiple times to put James Maloney in under the posts, then made some runs. He took advantage of a loose ball from Justin O'Neill to score under the posts.  Fifita was adjudged man of the match. During RLWC 2017, despite being named in the Australian team, Fifita opted to play for Tonga, and was instrumental in their most successful World Cup campaign to date, reaching the semi-finals.  On 2 December 2017, it was revealed that Fifita was taking NRL club Canterbury to court over a contract dispute which was reportedly worth $3.2 million over 4 seasons.\n\n2018\nFifita had a strong year in 2018. He captained the Sharks on occasion and was awarded the Dally M Prop of the Year.  In November, it was revealed by The Daily Telegraph that Cronulla had lost their 3 main sponsors ahead of the 2019 season.  According to the report, Cronulla were in talks with securing a major sponsor for the next five seasons equaling $6 million but the deal was cancelled due to Fifita and fellow Cronulla player Josh Dugan's antics during a podcast back in August 2018 when Fifita called Daily Telegraph sports columnist Phil Rothfield a \"complete fuckwit\" and Dugan calling Rothfield an \"old, weathered and baldheaded idiot\".\nIn the historic first ever rugby league Test between the Australian Kangaroos and Tonga, Fifita led the Tongan pre-match warcry, the sipi tau, in front of a sold-out crowd at Auckland's Mount Smart Stadium.  The Kangaroos went on to win 36–14.\n\n2019\nOn 3 May, Fifita ruled out a return to play for New South Wales saying \"The pinnacle of our game is to play for your country, And we’ve created something really good for international footy and I don’t want it to drop off\".\nIn Round 18 against the New Zealand Warriors, Fifita was sin binned with 10 minutes of play left after using an illegal shoulder charge on New Zealand player Lachlan Burr.  New Zealand would go on to kick the subsequent penalty goal and then kicked a field goal to win the match 19–18.  After the match, former NRL player Darren Lockyer branded Fifita \"irresponsible\" and \"lazy\".\nAt the end of the 2019 regular season, Cronulla finished in 7th spot and qualified for the finals. Fifita played in the club's elimination final defeat against Manly at Brookvale Oval.\n\n2020\nFifita played 12 games for Cronulla in the 2020 NRL season as the club finished 8th and qualified for the finals.  He played in Cronulla's elimination final loss against Canberra.\n\n2021\nFifita started the season in the NSW Cup, playing for Cronulla's feeder club Newtown.

        "content": "The Ateneo Blue Eagles are the collegiate varsity teams of the Ateneo de Manila University that play in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), the premiere collegiate league in the Philippines. The collegiate women's varsity basketball team is called the Lady Eagles. The Ateneo collegiate men's varsity basketball team was not always called the Blue Eagles. It got the name Blue Eagles when Ateneo adopted the Eagle as its mascot in 1938. Prior to that, from 1914 it was known under different names.\nAteneo has fifteen collegiate men's varsity teams that participate in fifteen sporting events of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines, its mother league.\n\nTeam identity\nTeam monikers\nWhen Ateneo started to participate in intercollegiate sports in 1914, its varsity basketball teams were simply referred to by the school community as the Ateneo Seniors and Ateneo Juniors. They were later dubbed the Blue and Whites by the sports press in the early 1920s when Ateneo joined sports leagues. When Ateneo adopted the Eagle as its mascot in 1938, the college team was given a new name: Blue Eagles. The Ateneo Blue Eagles are sometimes called the Hail Mary Quintet by the sports press. This moniker was given to the Blue Eagles in 1926 when sports press noticed that the team would pray the Hail Mary (as the school’s patroness is the Immaculate Conception) during game time-outs and would win by the skin of their teeth.\nAteneo is one of the four UAAP member schools that participate in all of the fifteen sporting events of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. Until 2020, The Guidon, the school's official student publication, gave specific names to differentiate the various varsity teams. However, beginning with UAAP Season 84 in May 2022, Ateneo de Manila University officially decided to unify student athletes and varsity teams under the \"Blue Eagles\" moniker moving forward, regardless of sport, gender, or age group.\n\nFormer sport–specific monikers\n\nMascot and colors\nAteneo has long been involved in intercollegiate sports dating back to 1914. It was a pioneer in Philippine collegiate sports. Ateneo was the first Philippine school to adopt a mascot, and was also the first school to field an organized cheering squad with cheerleaders which was later followed by another first when it introduced a Pep Band to augment the cheerleaders during games.\nThe choice of an eagle as school mascot holds iconic significance. Conferred with the title \"the King\", the Blue Eagle is a reference to the \"high-flying\" Ateneo varsity teams which would \"swoop down on the foe and sweep up the fields away\" as a dominating force in the field of sports.  Furthermore, there is some mythological significance to the eagle as a symbol of power.\nThe school used to have live eagles as pets in the former Padre Faura campus and later on at the Grade School campus in Loyola Heights. A live eagle would lead the men's varsity basketball team at the start of a game in the NCAA as the team enters the basketball court for their warm-up with the school Band playing the fight song, \"Blue Eagle – The King\".\nBlue and White, being the colors of the school's patroness, the Blessed Virgin Mary, were chosen as the school's colors. Thus blue and white are the colors of the uniforms of the varsity teams. Most of the school songs, yells and cheers have the words blue and white.\n\nAthletic associations\nCollegiate leagues\nThe Ateneo de Manila University is a member of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines, the premiere sports league in the country. It fields teams in all fifteen sporting events of the league. Ateneo was a founding member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which was established in 1924. It left the NCAA in 1978 due to the league-wide violence prevalent at the time, and then joined the UAAP in the same year.\n\nOther tournaments\nAside from the UAAP, the Ateneo Blue Eagles also participate during the UAAP preseason in other sports leagues/tournaments such as the Filoil EcoOil Preseason Cup, V-League, Shakey's Super League, and Ang Liga.\n\nTeam sports\nBasketball\nVolleyball\nThe Ateneo Volleyball Program enjoyed a modest success in the NCAA, having won a total of nine championships during a ten-year period from 1967 to 1976. The men's team had two titles and one from the women's, while the juniors team had won six titles. Ateneo dominated NCAA volleyball in the mid-1970s. In the UAAP, Ateneo has won five championships so far since transferring from the NCAA in 1978. These titles were won by the Lady Eagle Spikers in Season 76 (2013–14), Season 77 (2014–15) and Season 81 (2018–19) and by the Blue Eagle Spikers in Season 77 (2014–15), Season 78 (2015–16) and Season 79 (2016–17), finally ending a title drought of more than 30 years in UAAP volleyball.\n\nChampionships\nDouble Championships\nUAAP Finals Appearances\nThe Ateneo Blue Eagles Men's Volleyball Team\nThe Ateneo Blue Eagles Women's Volleyball Team\nFootball\nThe Ateneo varsity football teams have won a total 19 championships, 9 in the NCAA and 10 in the UAAP. In the NCAA, the seniors have won 6 titles. The men's team were the first to win a football championship in the NCAA when they won the title on the maiden season of the NCAA in 1924. They also won their first back-to-back (1953 and 1954) championship in the NCAA. In the UAAP, the seniors (men) have won 8 titles. The men's team were three-peat champions after winning in Seasons 2003–04, 2004–05 and 2005–06, a record that still holds today. Football was introduced in the UAAP Juniors Division as a demonstration sport in season 70 (2007–08) and declared a regular sport in season 72 (2009–10).\nFootball Championships\n\nNotable football players\nMen's Division\nVirgilio \"Baby\" Dalupan\nLuis \"Moro\" Lorenzo\nEdgardo \"Ed\" Ocampo\nJarvey Gayoso\n\nBaseball\nBaseball Championships\nNotable baseball players\nMen's Division\nAmbrosio \"Paddy\" Padilla\nKirk Long\n\nWomen's Division\nLaura Lehmann\n\nRankings\nThis is Ateneo's ranking in the team sports in the UAAP since 1986, the year the UAAP became an eight member-school league:\n\nChampionships\nOverall/General Championships\nAteneo has not won a UAAP General Championship in the seniors division since joining the UAAP in 1978.

        "content": "Siva (also spelt Shiva) is a 1989 Indian Telugu-language crime action film directed by Ram Gopal Varma and produced by Akkineni Venkat and Yarlagadda Surendra under Annapurna Studios and SS Creations. The film, which marks the directorial debut of Ram Gopal Varma, explores the concepts of student exploitation by anti-social elements and the impact of crowd psychology.\nVarma's script was based on his experiences as a student at Siddhartha Engineering College in Vijayawada. Tanikella Bharani wrote the dialogues. Ilaiyaraaja composed the soundtrack and score, while S. Gopala Reddy was its cinematographer. Thota Tharani and Sattibabu were the art director and editor respectively. The principal photography began on 16 February 1989, and was completed in 55 working days. Except for three days of shooting in Madras (now Chennai), Siva was filmed in Andhra Pradesh.\nProduced on a budget of ₹75 lakh, Siva was released on 5 October 1989 to critical acclaim, primarily for its technology and sound design. Although Venkat and Surendra expected the film to have average earnings, the film was commercially successful and went on to become the highest-grossing film of Telugu cinema. Siva completed a 100-day run in 22 centres and a 175-day run in five centres. It was featured in the Indian Panorama mainstream section of the 13th IFFI, held on 19 January 1990. In addition to the Filmfare Award for Best Film – Telugu, Siva won three Nandi Awards: Best Director (Varma), Best First Film of a Director, and Best Dialogue Writer (Bharani). Varma remade the film in Hindi with the same name with Nagarjuna and Amala reprising their roles and performed well at the box office.\nSiva attained cult status and was considered as Nagarjuna's breakthrough film. It was credited with the introduction of steadicam and new sound recording techniques in Telugu cinema, encouraging filmmakers to explore a variety of themes and make experimental films. For the April 2013 centennial of Indian cinema, News18 included Siva on its list of 100 greatest Indian films of all time. The Tamil-dubbed version Udhayam was also successful. Varma remade the film in Hindi with the same name with Nagarjuna and Amala reprising their roles and performed well at the box office.  A documentary titled Exploring Shiva after 25 Years was released on the film's silver anniversary and it was the first documentary about a Telugu film.\n\nPlot\nSiva, a college student from a nearby town, moves to Hyderabad with his brother Sarath's family and enrolls in the local VAS College of Arts and Sciences. Although Sarath and his daughter Keerthi get along well with Siva, Sarath's wife considers him a financial burden. Siva befriends a group of students at his college and falls in love with Asha, the sister of the honest Inspector Venkat. The college's unopposed students' union president J. Durga Rao (known as J. D), a troublemaker feared among the students and even faculty, happens to be the lowest rung on a gang ladder reaching from the gangster Ganesh to a local crime boss Bhavani.\nBhavani uses his network to support his mentor Machiraju, a burgeoning local politician. Although J. D. is arrested many times on various charges, Bhavani continues to bail him out. J.D once behaves inappropriately with Asha on campus, which infuriates Siva. He confronts JD and attacks him and his cronies with a bicycle chain, which fosters a rivalry between him and Ganesh. The incident encourages Siva's friends to ask him to stand for the students' union presidency, but Siva wants them to nominate Naresh (one of the group members) instead. Ganesh's  attempts to intimidate Siva becomes uesless. Bhavani learns about him and considers Siva as a potential replacement for J. D, whose weakness annoys him. \nNaresh is brutally assaulted one night by Ganesh and Bhavani's other henchmen and is taken to hospital. Siva retaliates, infuriating Bhavani. One day, when Siva's friends travel out of town to attend a wedding, they are attacked by Ganesh and others. One of Siva's friends Malli is murdered in the process and Siva swears vengeance. Sensing a risk to Sarath's family after an attempt on Keerthi's life, Siva leaves their house and moves into his friend Chinna's hostel. Siva agrees to contest the students' union presidential election. Bhavani cheats labour union leader Krishna Reddy, who changes his allegiance to Siva. Bhavani begins attacking and murdering Siva's close aides and Siva ensures that Sarath relocates to Warangal on transfer of his job. \nSiva attacks Bhavani's henchmen and helps Venkat arrest Ganesh. Machiraju sees Siva as a potential replacement for Bhavani and stops supporting the latter. Bhavani learns about Siva's relationship with Sarath and kidnaps Keerthi. Ganesh appears in court and an arrest warrant is issued for Bhavani. Insulted and humiliated, Bhavani kills Keerthi and Siva sets out to exact vengeance. While Bhavani comes out of Machiraju's house after killing him, Siva spots him and a chase ensues. Siva and Bhavani duel at a shopping complex rooftop. After brutally getting injured by Siva, Bhavani dies by falling from the rooftop. Venkat and Asha reach the mall and witness Bhavani's corpse among the crowd. Siva walks down the stairs and meets them up in dismay.\n\nCast\nProduction\nDevelopment\nAfter he graduated with a degree in civil engineering from Siddhartha Engineering College in Vijayawada, Ram Gopal Varma opened a video-rental shop in Ameerpet. Noting his son's interest in films, Penmatsa Krishnamraju (a former sound recordist for Annapurna Studios) helped Varma join the teams of Collector Gari Abbai (1987) and Rao Gari Illu (1988) as an assistant director. Varma befriended actor Nagarjuna, and filmmakers Akkineni Venkat and Yarlagadda Surendra. He presented his script for Raathri to them. When Nagarjuna rejected it, Varma presented another script based on his life as a student in Vijayawada. He earlier narrated this script to filmmaker K. Raghavendra Rao who suggested few changes because of its serious tone. Varma watched Rao's Kaliyuga Pandavulu (1986) and backed out after understanding Rao's point of view.\nWhen Rao Gari Illu was nearly completed, Varma asked co-director Siva Nageswara Rao to join him. He approached Tanikella Bharani to write the dialogues after observing his work in Ladies Tailor (1985) and Sri Kanaka Mahalakshmi Recording Dance Troupe (1987). Bharani found the plot (as described by Varma) similar to those of K. S. R. Das' films. Varma rejected Bharani's comic version, and asked to rewrite it as a crime drama. Although Bharani's usual fee was ₹25,000, he received ₹35,000 for Siva. Gunasekhar and Teja, who later pursued career as filmmakers, joined the film's crew as assistant directors.\nVenkat and Surendra produced Siva under their banners of Annapurna Studios and SS Creations, respectively. The production began in February 1989. Varma wanted M. M. Keeravani to compose the film's soundtrack and score, since Keeravani had assisted K. Chakravarthy on Rao Gari Illu. As both were inexperienced, Keeravani suggested that Varma choose a more seasoned technician and Ilaiyaraaja was signed instead. S. Gopala Reddy, Thota Tharani and Sattibabu were the film's director of photography, art director and editor, respectively. Gopala Reddy was inspired by Gordon Willis' work in The Godfather (1972).\n\nCasting\nSiva is Nagarjuna's 17th film as an actor. Varma found him the only actor who could understand his perspective. Nagarjuna and Varma had discussed astronomy and realised that they shared similar sensibilities. That, and Varma's passion for and dedication to films, prompted Nagarjuna to work with him. Amala, who worked with Nagarjuna in Prema Yuddham (1990), was chosen as the female lead. Siva was the first film in her career where the script was explained shot by shot. When Varma approached Rohini to dub Amala's portions, she agreed to dub for Amala only after watching about three reels of footage.\nVarma chose Raghuvaran to play the local crime boss, Bhavani. Varma wanted him to underplay the character, which was based on real life. Before accepting the role, Raghuvaran studied the mannerisms and lifestyles of mob leaders and criminals in Mumbai for 20 days. Varma wanted to name the characters played by Nagarjuna and Raghuvaran as Bhavani and Siva respectively. At Nagarjuna's request, he reversed the names. Varma chose newcomers Chakravarthy, Jithendra, and Ramjagan to play J. D., Chinna, and Naresh after auditioning them at Annapurna Studios. Uttej, one of Varma's assistant directors, played a comic role of a server in the college canteen. He recommended Varma to cast Sushma for Keerthi's role.\nP. Sai Kumar was initially supposed to play J. D., but the role went to Chakravarthy. Varma met the latter on the film's sets and asked him to perform a scene of his choice. Despite an unsuccessful screen test, Varma selected Chakravarthy after a meeting on the next day after observing the depth in his expression. Seasoned actors such as Murali Mohan, Gollapudi Maruti Rao, Kota Srinivasa Rao, Subhalekha Sudhakar, and Saichand played supporting roles. Bharani agreed to play Bhavani's assistant, Nanaji, at Varma's insistence. Producer Akkineni Venkat made a cameo appearance as one of Bhavani's clients, and Siva Nageswara Rao dubbed his portion. Brahmaji was cast as Bhavani's henchman.\n\nFilming\nVarma read about steadicam in American Cinematographer, and enquired about the possibility of a similar camera in India. After learning that steadicam was available in Chennai for four years and was already obsolete, Varma decided to use it despite Gopala Reddy's apprehension. Varma chose Rasool Ellore over Rajiv Menon and Deenpal to assist Gopala Reddy with the steadicam. Principal photography began on 16 February 1989, and wrapped in 55 working days. Except for three days in Chennai, the film was shot in Andhra Pradesh.\nThe scenes of the protagonist's college life were filmed at Keyes High school, near Secunderabad Junction railway station. A school wall was demolished, and a gate was repaired for the film's opening scene. Raghuvaran was carried away during the shoot of few action sequences and slapped Brahmaji for nearly six times in a row. To avoid such issues in the case of murder scenes, Varma decided to complete a few of them by using plain close-ups of the victims.\nSudhakar's murder scene was filmed near Keesara in Ranga Reddy district. Gopala Reddy and Ellore placed a camera in a bag and ran behind him for a shaky effect. In the cycle-chain scene in which Siva uses a cycle chain to fight with J. D., the hand pulling the chain was Ellore's; in the next shot, Nagarjuna is shown holding the chain. The scene in which Naresh is killed near his home was filmed in the streets of Vengala Rao Nagar. The cycle chase scenes were filmed in Somajiguda and the slums behind Yashoda Hospitals. The bus chase scene was shot in Yusufguda. The film's climax was filmed at the Swapnalok complex in Secunderabad, and Bhavani's suicide was filmed on a set at Venus Studios in Chennai.\nSeveral romantic scenes with Nagarjuna and Amala were initially filmed at Ushakiron Movies in Secunderabad. Dissatisfied with the results, Varma reshot them at the Osman Ali House. Mugur Sundar choreographed the songs, and \"Anando Brahma\" was filmed at the Borra Caves in Visakhapatnam. The film crew had to crawl into the caves, making Siva the first Telugu film shot in its interiors. The remaining songs were filmed on sets at Annapurna Studios. Srinivasa Rao filmed his scenes in one day. The fights, choreographed by Varma, featured hand-to-hand combat and attacks with hooks as he was trained in kickboxing.\n\nThemes and influences\nSiva explores the exploitation of students by anti-social elements against a mafia backdrop and the impact on them of crowd psychology. It also focuses on politics and betrayal in the scene where Bhavani murders Machiraju and his enemy Viswanadham. As a student, Varma observed and participated in gang wars and student politics besides analysing the impact of a gangster's lifestyle and body language on students. Those experiences inspired him to begin writing Siva.\nMost of the characters, including Bhavani, were inspired by real life. Bhavani was based on Radha, an actual crime boss with a reputation for violence in Vijayawada; Bhavani, like Radha, is also a woman's name. Siva's character was comparatively fictitious whom Varma considered an \"ideal person\" making the society \"too dramatic\". Siva was partially based on Varma's friend, Golla Ravi, who lived in Punjagutta. Assistant director Krishna Vamsi found the film's story similar to Arjun (1985). Varma said that Arjun was an inspiration for Siva, since Sunny Deol's title character in Arjun was a hero who \"does not bend to forces larger than himself\". Apart from Arjun, Varma was also inspired by Ardh Satya (1983) and Kaal Chakra (1988).\nThe basic plot of The Way of the Dragon (1972) was adapted by Varma for Siva. In The Way of the Dragon, Tang Lung (Bruce Lee) comes from Hong Kong to work in a Chinese restaurant in Rome and fights local gangsters who try to intimidate the owners; this leads to a rivalry with a crime boss (Chuck Norris). In Siva, Nagarjuna comes from a nearby town to Vijayawada to further his education, fights gangsters and develops a rivalry with Raghuvaran. While Lee and Norris fight at the Colosseum at the climax of The Way of the Dragon, Nagarjuna and Raghuvaran duel on a building terrace in Siva.\nIn addition to The Way of the Dragon, Varma adapted scenes from a number of other films. Malli's mother slapping a police inspector for failing to save him was inspired by Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975), and the cycle chase scene was based on a similar scene in Arjun. A scene in which goons demand donations to build a temple for Ganesha was from Kaal Chakra. Although Varma wanted to film a fight between Nagarjuna and Chakravarthy during a football match (based on a similar scene in 1978's Damien: Omen II), Venkat was indifferent to the idea.\n\nMusic\nSiva's five-song soundtrack album and background score were composed by Ilaiyaraaja, with Veturi Sundararama Murthy writing the lyrics of \"Anando Brahma\", \"Enniyallo\", and \"Kiss Me Hello\". Sirivennela Seetharama Sastry wrote the lyrics for the remaining two songs: \"Botany\" and \"Sarasalu\". S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, S. Janaki, K. S. Chithra, and Mano were the singers. The soundtrack—in the only collaboration between Varma and Ilaiyaraaja—was successful upon release.\n\nRelease\nSiva was produced on a budget of ₹75 lakh. Venkat and Surendra retained the distribution rights for Nizam, Vishakhapatnam and the East and West Godavari regions. The film was released on 5 October 1989, It was featured in the Indian Panorama mainstream section of the 13th International Film Festival of India, held on 19 January 1990 at the Empire Theatre in Kolkata. The Tamil remake rights to Siva were initially sold for ₹100,000. After the film's release, Venkat and Surendra dubbed it into Tamil as Udhayam and sold its distribution rights for ₹85 lakh. It was released on 12 January 1990 in 24 centres.\n\nReception\nSiva received praised for its usage of technology and sound design. The distributors were concerned about the film's violence, saying that it would alienate family audience, whom the film industry believed were the majority of the audience. Although Venkat and Surendra expected that the film would have average earnings, Siva was a commercial success and earned ₹1 crore in the Nizam region alone (a first in Telugu cinema). In addition to ₹50,000, Varma received five percent of Siva's profits. The film had a 100-day run in 22 centres and a 175-day run in five centres. The Tamil version Udhayam was commercially successful and earned more than ₹2 crore. Nagarjuna's father Akkineni Nageswara Rao advised Varma to place an advertisement thanking the audience for the film's success. Varma opposed it, believing that a film's success should be credited to the production team and its failure attributed to the director. When Varma's second film Kshana Kshanam (1991) underperformed at the box office, Siva's success was considered accidental. For the April 2013 centennial of Indian cinema, News18 included Siva on its list of 100 greatest Indian films of all time, calling it a \"completely new take on student politics and the ideologies driving it\" and saying that the film's ideas \"found a reflection in many university elections during a later stage\".\n\nAwards\nRemakes\nSiva was remade by Varma in Hindi as Shiva in 1990, and was Nagarjuna's acting debut in Hindi cinema. It was the last Hindi film with Amala in a lead role. Minor changes were made to the remake's cast and crew. All the songs in the Telugu version were used unchanged except for \"Botany\", which was reshot at Acharya N. G. Ranga Agricultural University in Rajendranagar. Telugu filmmaker Puri Jagannadh was cast as one of Nagarjuna's friends in the remake. Jagannadh wanted to assist Varma and approached him for an opportunity. Varma insisted Jagannadh to act and he obliged, feeling that this experience would teach him something. Produced in association with Atluri Purnachandra Rao on a budget of ₹1.15 crore, Shiva was released on 7 December 1990 and was successful in Mumbai and Kolkata.\nDuring the production of James (2005), Varma planned to remake Siva. The second remake, also entitled Shiva, featured Mohit Ahlawat and Priyanka Kothari as the characters played by Nagarjuna and Amala in the original. Unlike Siva, the protagonist in the second remake is an honest man who joins the Mumbai Police as a new recruit; the cycle-chain scene and Raghuvaran's character were omitted. Shiva received negative reviews; Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com wrote that the film \"dare[d] to ridiculously rest on the incapable shoulders of a non-acting cast\", and nastiness was \"defined as a scowling ogre\".\n\nSequel\nIn September 2020 Nagarjuna said that a sequel to Siva would be a viable alternative to a digitised version, and proposed a film about Siva, Asha, and their two sons. Advising Varma to develop a script, he asked the director to cast Amala, Naga Chaitanya and Akhil Akkineni. The sequel would reportedly be produced by Annapurna Studios.\n\nAftermath\nDigitisation\nIn September 2014, Siva was digitally remastered for theatrical release. Supriya Yarlagadda of Annapurna Studios said that the decision to remaster and digitise was made after observing the challenges in storing and preserving old film prints. The process (carried out in Mumbai) took a year, and the film's colour and sound quality were enhanced to meet current standards. A silver jubilee event was held on 7 October 2014 in Hyderabad, where Nagarjuna announced that Siva's digitised version would be released on 17 October 2014 on nearly 100 screens. In April 2015, Varma told Indo-Asian News Service that the digitised release was postponed until 15 May because of restoration delays.\n\nDocumentary\nDuring the digitisation of Shiva, Varma said that he would release a documentary on the making of the film entitled Exploring Shiva after 25 Years. The first documentary based on a Telugu film, it provided a \"holistic view of the film\" and featured interviews with the cast and crew and segments on its sound and filming locations. The documentary was released on 5 October 2014, coinciding with Siva's silver anniversary.\n\nLegacy\nInfluence on film personalities\nSiva, which attained cult status in Telugu cinema, is one of the first Telugu films produced after the migration of Telugu film industry from Madras to Hyderabad to feature characters speaking the Telangana dialect. The film made Nagarjuna a superstar in Telugu cinema; it changed his career, and earned him a reputation for encouraging new directors. Nagarjuna considered Siva a milestone in his personal life as well since he and Amala, who were in a relationship during the film's shoot, decided to marry after its completion.\nAccording to filmmaker V. V. Vinayak and writer Pulagam Chinnarayana, Siva divided Telugu cinema into two eras: before and after the film. With Siva, Varma was credited with the introduction of steadicams and new sound recording techniques in Telugu films. Within a year of the film's release, more than ten steadicams were imported into India. Siva attracted the young audience during its theatrical run, and its success encouraged filmmakers to explore a variety of themes and make experimental Telugu films.\nBharani broke through as an actor and dialogue writer with the film. Chakravarthy, Jithendra and Ramjagan achieved success with Siva, and the former two adapted J. D. and Chinna as screen names. Kannada actor and filmmaker Upendra reworked the narrative of Om (1995) when he found the previous version similar to Siva. Telugu filmmaker S. S. Rajamouli understood the importance of heightening tension in action sequences, and the impact created by proper use of sound after watching Siva. Srinu Vaitla, Sudheer Varma, and Praveen Sri were inspired by Siva to pursue careers as directors; Sri assisted Ram Gopal Varma before he made his directorial debut with Gaayam 2 (2010). Music director Munna Kasi was inspired by Ilaiyaraaja's work in Siva, and wanted to work with Varma after he graduated. On the rise of antisocial-element-based scripts in Tamil cinema, trade analyst Sreedhar Pillai said in May 2002 that Siva's Tamil-dubbed version (Udhayam) was the \"forerunner\" of city-based crime films.\nTamil actor Ganesh Venkatraman was \"mesmerised\" as a child by Siva, admiring Nagarjuna and carrying a cycle chain in his schoolbag. About the impact of Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) on Indian cinema, Rana Daggubati said that regional films can gain national acceptance for their content and cited the success of Siva and Roja (1992) as examples. In March 2016, Karthi said that he admired Nagarjuna after seeing Udhayam its Tamil dubbed version and Idhayathai Thirudathe (1989) and found working with him in Oopiri (2016) \"a great chance to know him.\"\n\nIn popular culture\nThe cycle-chain scene became popular, with people telling Varma that they broke a cycle chain after seeing Siva; the director called them the \"ultimate example of how imagination can take over and become a reality in time\". As of 2014, the chain used in the film is owned by Chakravarthy. Film-poster designers Anil and Bhanu said that posters should be designed to make a subconscious impact on the viewer, citing the title logo of Siva (with Nagarjuna and the cycle chain) as an example. Inspired by Varma's work in Siva, Rajamouli composed the action sequence during the intermission of his directorial debut Student No. 1 (2001), and followed the shot division of the cycle-chain scene for the same.\nChakravarthy agreed to play the antagonist in Naga Chaitanya's acting debut, Josh (2009), and said that its makers are \"trying to get JD of Shiva who actually ran away mid way from college\". Bangalore Mirror and other reviewers noted similarities between Josh and Siva, which Chaitanya called a \"coincidence\". Chaitanya's films, Bezawada (2011)—produced by Varma—and Autonagar Surya (2014), were noted for similarities to Siva. Siva was parodied in several films such as Lakshmi (2006), Oosaravelli (2011), Katha Screenplay Darsakatvam Appalaraju (2011) (also directed by Varma), and Sudigadu (2012).\nAmala listed Siva with Pushpaka Vimana (1987), Vedham Pudhithu (1987), Agni Natchathiram (1988), and Karpoora Mullai (1991) as her most memorable films. Geethika Chandrahasan Sudip of The Hindu listed Siva for the letter S in the July 2015 \"ABCD of Telugu cinema\". In August 2015, Pooja Darade of The Times of India included the film on her list of \"Telugu movies one must watch before dying\". Fahad Usmani of The Hindu compared Siva to Mother India (1957), Sholay (1975), Mr. India (1987), Agneepath (1990), and Ghayal (1990), noting that their antagonists became more popular than their heroes.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nChinnarayana, Pulagam (August 2007). శివ—సెల్యులాయిడ్ చరిత్రలో సహజావేశం [Siva—A natural frustration in the history of celluloid] (in Telugu).

        "content": "The Bella Twins were an American professional wrestling tag team that performed in WWE and consisted of identical twin sisters Brie Bella and Nikki Bella. Each of the Bella Twins are former WWE Divas Champions. Brie was the first twin in WWE to win the title, while Nikki won it twice with her second reign of 301 days being the longest reign for the now defunct title.\nBoth sisters signed with WWE in 2007 and were assigned to the developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling. Brie Bella was called up to the main roster in 2008. In early appearances, she surreptitiously switched places with her sister to win her matches. After some weeks, Nikki Bella was revealed as her twin. During the next few years, they worked together as a team, as well as individually. Each sister won the WWE Divas Championship once before they were released in 2012. The Bella Twins made their return in 2013 and were featured in the reality show Total Divas before getting their own spin-off, Total Bellas. They were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2021 as a team. The twins would only make occasional appearances in WWE in their last few years, but acted as ambassadors for the company until their contracts expired in 2023. Following this, they retired the \"Bella\" name and reintroduced themselves as The Garcia Twins as \"Garcia\" was their maiden name.\nIn November 2015, Nikki was ranked No. 1 in Pro Wrestling Illustrated's Female 50. In 2015, Nikki also won a WWE Slammy Award for Diva of The Year.\n\nEarly lives and careers\nNicole and Brianna Garcia were born sixteen minutes apart on November 21, 1983, in Brawley, California and raised on a farm in the outskirts of Scottsdale, Arizona. They are of Mexican and Italian descent and played soccer in their youth. The twins graduated from Chaparral High School in 2002. They returned to San Diego for college, where Nicole continued playing soccer for Grossmont College, with both twins also working at Hooters. A year later, the twins relocated to Los Angeles in pursuit of acting and modeling opportunities, making ends meet doing various gigs from marketing for a now defunct record label, to cocktail waitressing at the Mondrian Hotel.\nThey then made their first national TV appearance on the Fox reality show Meet My Folks. Following this appearance, the twins were hired to be the World Cup Twins for Budweiser and were photographed holding the World Cup trophy. They were contestants in the 2006 \"International Body Doubles twins search\". They participated in the 2006 WWE Diva Search, but did not make the cut.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment/WWE\nFlorida Championship Wrestling (2007–2008)\nThe Bella Twins were signed to developmental contracts by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in June 2007 and were assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), WWE's then-developmental territory, in Tampa, Florida. On September 14, the twins made their in-ring debut defeating Nattie Neidhart and Krissy Vaine with Victoria Crawford as the special guest referee. As a part of their on-screen personas, they switched places behind the referee's back if one of them was hurt. This was called \"Twin Magic\". They also occasionally competed in mixed tag team matches, teaming with male wrestlers including Kofi Kingston and Robert Anthony. They also made some non-wrestling appearances on Heath Miller's Happy Hour promo segment.\nStarting in December 2007, they managed Derrick Linkin, but this storyline was cut short when Linkin was released in January 2008. They then resumed their feud with Neidhart and Crawford, wrestling them throughout much of 2008. In FCW, the twins competed in bikini contests and wrestled against Katie Lea Burchill, Milena Roucka, and Nattie Neidhart. Their last FCW appearance was on September 2, when they competed in a Divas battle royal won by Miss Angela.\n\nVarious storylines (2008–2011)\nOn the August 29 episode of SmackDown, Brianna debuted as Brie Bella and defeated Victoria. She had a series of matches with Victoria and Victoria's accomplice Natalya. In each match, Brie would roll out of the ring, slip underneath it, and emerge surprisingly revived to win the match. On the November 7 episode of SmackDown, Brie picked up a win against Victoria and then ran under the ring to escape Natalya and Victoria, but Victoria and Natalya both reached for Brie under the ring, resulting in both Nicole and Brie being pulled out. Nicole was then introduced as Nikki Bella. The twins had their first official match as a team on the November 21 episode of SmackDown, defeating Victoria and Natalya. They continued competing in tag team matches over the following months.\n\nStarting in November, the twins developed an on-screen relationship with The Colóns (Carlito and Primo). In February 2009, the storyline expanded to include John Morrison and The Miz, who flirted with the Bellas and took them on a date for Valentine's Day. The date provoked a rivalry between the teams of The Miz and Morrison and Primo and Carlito, with the four competing for the affection of the twins, who were seemingly unable to choose between them. On March 17 on ECW, Carlito and Primo, aiming for Morrison and The Miz, accidentally spat apples in the face of Brie. Nikki began to laugh at Brie's misfortune, and a fight broke out between the two, which led to Nikki leaving with The Miz and Morrison while Brie stayed with Primo and Carlito. Brie won her first match over Nikki in a six-person intergender tag team match on SmackDown the following week. On ECW on March 31, Nikki pinned Brie in their first singles match against each other after a distraction from Morrison and The Miz.\nOn April 15, The Bella Twins were both drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2009 supplemental draft. On April 27, Brie made her Raw in-ring debut in an eight-Diva tag team match, which her team won. Nikki also made an appearance, reuniting with her twin, as she was under the ring to help Brie during the match. Nikki then made her in-ring debut for the brand the following month in a battle royal, but was eliminated by Beth Phoenix.\nOn June 29, they were both traded to the ECW brand. They debuted on ECW the following night on The Abraham Washington Show, as the special guests. They quickly developed a storyline feud with Katie Lea Burchill, when Nikki defeated her in a match by switching places with Brie behind the referee's back. The following week on Superstars, Brie defeated Burchill after a similar fashion, and the feud ended in September, when Nikki defeated Burchill on Superstars.\n\nOn October 12, the Bellas were traded back to Raw as part of a tri-branded Divas trade, where they predominately appeared in backstages segments with the weekly guest stars and only occasionally competed in matches. In June 2010, they developed a feud with Jillian Hall, when Brie defeated her after switching places with Nikki. The following week, Nikki defeated Hall after switching with Brie. The feud was exacerbated when the Bellas acted as the special guest referees during one of Hall's matches. During the match, Hall attacked both twins, but lost the match when Nikki made a fast count, allowing her to be pinned by Gail Kim. The next week on Superstars, the twins defeated Hall and Maryse in a tag team match to end the storyline.\n\nOn August 31, The Bella Twins announced they would be part of the all-female third season of NXT, mentoring Jamie. Jamie was the first rookie Diva eliminated on the October 5 episode of NXT. In November, the twins began a storyline with Daniel Bryan, when Brie accompanied him to the ring for his match. Following his win, Nikki ran out and the two fought over Bryan's affection, until Bryan broke it up and had them hug each other. They began to manage Bryan and frequently accompanied him to the ring over the next two months. In January 2011, they discovered Bryan kissing Gail Kim backstage and assaulted her. They continued to attack Kim, both at the Royal Rumble on January 30 and the following night on Raw. On February 7, they teamed with Melina in a losing effort to Kim, Eve Torres and Tamina.\n\nDivas Champions (2011–2012)\nThe Bellas began feuding with Eve Torres after they appeared as lumberjills during a Divas Championship match between Torres and Natalya on the February 14 episode of Raw. Following the match, they attacked Torres backstage before Gail Kim and Natalya stopped them. The next week on Raw, the twins defeated Torres and Kim in a tag team match. The following week on Raw, Nikki won a battle royal to become the number one contender for the Divas Championship and unsuccessfully challenged Torres for the championship on March 7.\nOn April 11, Brie defeated Torres to win the Divas Championship, marking the first time either twin had held a championship in WWE. On May 22, Brie went on to successfully defend the championship against Kelly Kelly at Over the Limit after switching places with Nikki. On a special \"Power to the People\" episode of Raw on June 20, Brie defended her WWE Divas Championship against Kelly (who was selected by voters), losing the title and ending her reign at 70 days. On July 17, Brie challenged Kelly for the championship in a rematch at Money in the Bank on July 17, but she failed to win.\nThe Bellas began to show friction in March 2012 after both twins lost to AJ Lee in singles competition. After Brie's match with Lee, Nikki revealed that Brie was rooting for Team Johnny in the 12-man tag team match at WrestleMania XXVIII on April 1 whilst Nikki was rooting for Team Teddy, thus furthering their dissension.\nOn the April 6 episode of SmackDown, Nikki defeated the Divas Champion Beth Phoenix in a non-title match after Kelly Kelly distracted Phoenix. On April 23, Nikki defeated Phoenix in a lumberjill match on Raw to win the Divas Championship for the first time. Brie lost Nikki's championship to Layla at Extreme Rules on April 29 after Twin Magic failed, ending her Divas Championship reign after only a week. The following night on Raw, they competed in their last match with the WWE, failing to win back the Divas Championship from Layla in a triple threat match. Later that night, WWE announced on their website that the twins had been fired by Executive Administrator Eve Torres.\n\nIndependent circuit promotions (2012–2013)\nOn May 1, 2012, the twins appeared at their first independent wrestling show in Newburgh, New York at Northeast Wrestling. They later appeared for CTWE Pro Wrestling at the Season Beatings pay-per-view on December 15, each accompanying a different wrestler to the ring.\n\nReturn to WWE\nTotal Divas storylines (2013–2014)\nThe Bella Twins returned to WWE on the March 11, 2013, episode of Raw in a backstage segment with Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow). On the March 15 episode of SmackDown, the twins attacked The Funkadactyls (Cameron and Naomi) and the following week interfered in matches between Team Rhodes Scholars and Brodus Clay and Tensai, but were attacked by The Funkadactyls. The twins made their in-ring return defeating The Funkadactyls on the March 27 episode of Main Event after interference from Cody Rhodes. The Bella Twins were scheduled to participate in an eight-person tag team match with Team Rhodes Scholars against Tons of Funk (Clay and Tensai) and The Funkadactyls at WrestleMania 29 on April 7, but the match was canceled due to time restraints and instead took place the following night on Raw, where The Bella Twins and Team Rhodes Scholars were defeated. In June, Nikki suffered a fractured tibia.\nUpon the debut of the Total Divas reality television program in July, The Bellas began a feud with their co-star on the show Natalya, with Brie and Natalya trading victories in singles competition on Raw and at SummerSlam on August 18. The cast of Total Divas then transitioned into a scripted feud with Divas Champion AJ Lee, who mocked the show and cast. At Night of Champions on September 15, Brie unsuccessfully challenged Lee for the Divas Championship in a four-way match, which also involved Natalya and Naomi. Continuing their feud into October, Brie and Lee faced off at Battleground and Hell in a Cell for the Divas Championship, but Brie was unsuccessful. Nikki returned to in-ring action on the October 25 episode of SmackDown, losing to Lee. At Survivor Series on November 24, the twins were part of the victorious Team Total Divas. On April 6, they failed to win the Divas Championship again at WrestleMania XXX in the Divas Invitational match, which was won by Lee.\n\nBrief split (2014)\nIn April 2014, Brie became involved in her real-life husband Daniel Bryan's ongoing storyline with Stephanie McMahon and Kane, whereas part of the storyline McMahon threatened to fire Brie if an injured Bryan did not relinquish the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Payback on June 1, which forced Brie to \"quit\" WWE before slapping McMahon in the face. After Brie \"quit\", McMahon put Nikki in several handicap matches as punishment. After a month absence, Brie returned to WWE television, appearing in the crowd on July 21 and starting a confrontation with McMahon who slapped Brie and was subsequently arrested. In order to have Brie drop the \"charges\", Brie was rehired and received a match against McMahon at SummerSlam.\nNikki attacked Brie at the event on August 17, which allowed McMahon to win the match. The next several weeks saw the twins fight in several backstage and in-ring segments, including a cameo appearance from Jerry Springer on Raw on September 8. As part of the storyline, McMahon declared Nikki the face of the WWE Divas division and granted her a match at Night of Champions for the Divas Championship, which she failed to win. At Hell in a Cell, Nikki defeated Brie in a match where the loser was forced to become the winner's personal assistant for 30 days.\n\nNikki and Brie reunited at Survivor Series on November 23 when Nikki defeated AJ Lee with Brie's help to become a two-time Divas Champion. Nikki retained her championship in three separate occasions—against Lee in a rematch at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 14, against Naomi two days later on SmackDown and against Paige on February 22, 2015, at Fastlane. Paige and Lee then formed an alliance against the Bellas which led to a tag team match at WrestleMania 31 on March 29, which the Bellas lost.\n\nTeam Bella (2015)\nOn April 20, 2015, at Monday Night Raw, the Bella Twins would briefly turn babyfaces. After Nikki retained her title over Naomi at Extreme Rules on April 26, Nikki started a feud with Naomi after she aligned with the returning Tamina to even the odds against Bellas. This led to a tag team match between the two teams at Payback on May 17, which Naomi and Tamina won. At Elimination Chamber on May 31, Nikki retained her title against Naomi and Paige in a triple threat match, with Brie banned from ringside.\nIn June, The Bella Twins became heels once again by employing Twin Magic, which helped Nikki retain the title against Paige on the June 1 episode of Raw and at Money in the Bank on June 14. During the feud with Paige, Alicia Fox allied with them to form Team Bella. At The Beast in the East on July 4, Nikki retained the title against Paige and Tamina.\nAfter weeks of Team Bella outnumbering Paige, Naomi and Tamina, Stephanie McMahon called for a \"revolution\" in the WWE Divas division and introduced the debuting Charlotte and Becky Lynch as Paige's allies while NXT Women's Champion Sasha Banks debuted as an ally to Naomi and Tamina, which led to a brawl between the three teams. Nikki then lost to Charlotte in a tag team match on the August 3 episode of Raw and to Banks on the August 17 episode of Raw in a non-title match. On August 23, the three teams faced off at SummerSlam in a three team elimination match in which Team Bella first eliminated Team B.A.D. before Team PCB's win.\nOn the September 14 episode of Raw, Nikki defended her title against Charlotte, who pinned Brie after the twins had switched places to win the match, but she retained the championship since the title cannot change hands by disqualification and in the process became the new longest reigning Divas Champion in history, surpassing AJ Lee's previous record of 295 days.\n\nSporadic appearances and Hall of Fame (2015–2022)\nOn September 20, Nikki dropped the championship to Charlotte at Night of Champions, ending her reign at 301 days and failing to regain the title in a rematch at Hell in a Cell on October 25. Shortly after, Nikki went on a hiatus from both television and in-ring competition due to a neck injury which would require surgery, but returned for one night on December 21 to accept the Slammy Award for Diva of the Year. During Nikki's absence, Brie continued to compete in singles competition and in tag team matches with Fox. Brie was unsuccessful in winning the Divas Championship at Fastlane on February 21 in a match against Charlotte. During that time, Team Bella quietly disbanded.\n\nIn March 2016, Brie was placed in a feud with Lana, who argued that Brie's fans only supported her out of pity for having a \"bad husband\". Brie then aligned herself with fellow Total Divas cast members Alicia Fox, Natalya, Paige and Eva Marie while Lana aligned herself with Team B.A.D. (Naomi and Tamina), Summer Rae and Emma (which was officially called Team B.A.D. and Blonde), leading to a 10-woman tag team match on the WrestleMania 32 kickoff show on April 3, which Team Total Divas would win when Naomi submitted to Brie. After the match, Nikki returned and celebrated with her co-stars. On April 6, Brie confirmed that she would be taking an extended break from in-ring competition, citing family reasons while also stating that she will continue working for WWE as an ambassador.\nOn January 22, 2018, on the Raw 25 Years special episode, The Bella Twins were honored as part of a segment involving women considered legends that contributed to the company's success. At the Royal Rumble on January 28, Brie and Nikki participated in the first ever women's Royal Rumble match at No. 28 and No. 27, respectively, making it into the final four with Asuka and Sasha Banks, with Nikki eliminating Brie before being eliminated herself by the winner Asuka. On the September 3 episode of Raw, The Bella Twins competed for the first time in three years, defeating The Riott Squad (Liv Morgan and Sarah Logan). The Bellas teamed with Ronda Rousey to defeat The Riott Squad at WWE Super Show-Down on October 6 and won the rematch two nights later on Raw. After the rematch, the Bellas attacked Rousey. Nikki received a title opportunity against Rousey at WWE Evolution on October 28, but was unsuccessful. In March 2019, both Bellas announced on Total Bellas that they had retired from in-ring competition with Brie making the announcement on the March 10 episode and Nikki announcing her retirement on the season finale on March 24. At February 21, 2020 edition of SmackDown, it was announced that both Bellas will be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, during A Moment of Bliss segment. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ceremony took place the next year. On January 30, 2022, after a three-year break from wrestling, The Bella Twins participated in the 2022 Royal Rumble.\nOn March 14, 2023, on their podcast The Nikki & Brie Show, Nikki and Brie announced that their contracts with WWE had expired, and it was mutually agreed to not renew their contracts, as the twins wanted to start a new chapter in their lives. They subsequently reintroduced themselves as The Garcia Twins as \"Garcia\" was their maiden name.\n\nOther media\nGuest appearances\nPrior to working with WWE, the twins appeared on Meet My Folks.

        "content": "Joe Montana Football is an American football video game developed by Park Place Productions, and published by Sega for the Genesis in 1991. While the game does feature Joe Montana as a playable character, Sega did not obtain licenses from either the National Football League or the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), meaning no other players, nor any official team names, are used. It was the first of many Sega published football games across the 1990s prior to moving into the NFL 2K branding in the 2000s.\n\nGameplay\nSimilar to other football games of the time, the gameplay follows a slightly simplified version of standard American Football rules. Players have the option to play as different teams, as well as select number of players. Players also have the option to turn penalties on or off. Players may also play a normal game, a mode with a two-minute drill, and the Sega Bowl mode.\nThough Joe Montana Football and John Madden Football were made by the same company, Madden had realistic plays and a full roster of 28 teams, while Montana was a more arcade-style game with only 16 teams and a simplified, passing-intensive offense.\n\nDevelopment\nFollowing the launch of the Genesis in the United States, Sega of America president and CEO Michael Katz planned to create a library of instantly-recognizable titles for the console by contracting with celebrities and athletes to produce games using their names and likenesses. As part of this, Sega signed a $1.7 million five-year contract with Joe Montana, despite concerns among the Japanese executives that the game would not earn enough to cover this cost.\nSega had previously developed two American football games for the Master System console, Great Football in 1987 and American Pro Football (Walter Payton Football) in 1989, the latter very well-received by critics at the time. Joe Montana Football was originally intended to be an update of Great Football.\nSince Sega of America did not at the time have a large game production facility, they contracted with Mediagenic (Activision) to develop the game for November 1989. No one at Sega was aware of the turmoil inside Mediagenic at the time; despite five months of reports that development was proceeding on schedule, Katz discovered in September or October that the game was hardly begun. To have a football game for Christmas release, Sega would have to find an already-completed game that could be converted.\nSega approached Electronic Arts, developer of the Madden NFL series, and president Trip Hawkins, for help, suggesting that he cancel the upcoming Genesis version of Madden in order to work on the game. Hawkins agreed to help Sega but refused to cancel his company's game instead working on both projects. He intentionally made Montana a worse game than Madden, starting with the basic code for the former he removed the 3D field as well as cut down the number of plays from 113 to 13.  According to Michael Knox a programmer on the game, most of the deliberate downgrading occurred after the company had already completed the game. Joe Montana Football missed the Christmas deadline and was released in January 1991, shortly after the Genesis version of John Madden Football.\n\nReception\nAlthough not as successful as the Madden series, Joe Montana Football and the sequels helped establish the Genesis' reputation as the top platform for sports simulations and proved to Sega Enterprises that sports games could be worthwhile investments. Website Den of Geek would credit both series for helping Sega gain an edge over Nintendo writing \" High school and college jocks who would normally be more likely to taunt someone who identified as a video game nerd suddenly found themselves playing for bragging rights on all-night sessions of Madden.\"\n\nLegacy\nJoe Montana Football was followed by four sequels, all developed by BlueSky Software instead of Park Place Productions: Joe Montana Football II: Sports Talk Football, NFL Sports Talk Football '93, NFL Football '94 Starring Joe Montana, and NFL '95. After the contract with Joe Montana ended in 1995, development on the sixth game in Sega's NFL series moved to Farsight Technologies and the franchise was rebranded as Prime Time NFL Starring Deion Sanders.  In 2015, Damon Grow, CEO of Superstar Games, tweeted snippets of Joe Montana Football 16. Joe Montana subsequently released a screenshot of the game. At E3, Damon Grow revealed the game as \"Joe Montana Football\", a mobile game coming to iOS, followed by Android and PC.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Bloomington is a city in and the county seat of Monroe County, Indiana, United States. The population was 79,168 at the 2020 census. It is the seventh-most populous city in Indiana and the fourth-most populous outside the Indianapolis metropolitan area. It is the home of Indiana University Bloomington, the flagship campus of the Indiana University system. Established in 1820, IU Bloomington enrolls over 45,000 students.\nThe city was established in 1818 by a group of settlers from Kentucky, Tennessee, the Carolinas, and Virginia who were so impressed with \"a haven of blooms\" that they called it Bloomington. It is the principal city of the Bloomington metropolitan area in south-central Indiana, which had 161,039 residents in 2020. Bloomington has been designated a Tree City USA since 1984. The city was also the location of the Academy Award–winning 1979 movie Breaking Away, featuring a reenactment of Indiana University's annual Little 500 bicycle race.\n\nHistory\nThe area in which Bloomington is situated was previously inhabited by the Delaware, Potawatomi, Miami, and Eel River Miami. \nBloomington was platted in 1818. A post office has been in operation at Bloomington since 1825. Bloomington was incorporated in 1827.\nThe current city logo was adopted on January 6, 1986, by the Bloomington Common Council. It was a combination of peony and trout lily, inspired by both quilt patterns used by regional folk artists in 19th century and the shape of Downtown Square.\nThe Elias Abel House, Blair-Dunning House, Bloomington City Hall, Bloomington West Side Historic District, Cantol Wax Company Building, Coca-Cola Bottling Plant, Cochran-Helton-Lindley House, Courthouse Square Historic District, Hinkle-Garton Farmstead, Home Laundry Company, Illinois Central Railroad Freight Depot, Johnson's Creamery, Legg House, Millen House, Millen-Chase-McCalla House, Monroe Carnegie Library, Monroe County Courthouse, Morgan House, J.L. Nichols House and Studio, North Washington Street Historic District, The Old Crescent, Princess Theatre, Prospect Hill Historic District, Second Baptist Church, Seminary Square Park, Steele Dunning Historic District, University Courts Historic District, Vinegar Hill Historic District, Wicks Building, Woolery Stone Company, and Andrew Wylie House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nMany African Americans moved to Bloomington from Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky during the 1860s through the 1880s. Bloomington also attracted Scotch-Irish Presbyterians from South Carolina.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the 2010 census, Bloomington has a total area of 23.359 square miles (60.50 km2), of which 23.16 square miles (59.98 km2) (or 99.15%) is land and 0.199 square miles (0.52 km2) (or 0.85%) is water.\n\nClimate\nSouth Central Indiana receives an abundance of rain, with a yearly average of nearly 50 inches.\n\nGeology\nBloomington is an area of irregular limestone terrain characterized by sinks, ravines, fissures, underground streams, sinking streams, springs and caves. It is in the rolling hills of southern Indiana, resting on the intersection of the Norman Uplands and the Mitchell Plain. The city's relatively varied topography is a sharp contrast to the flatter terrain more typical of central to northern portions of Indiana.\n\nWater\nBloomington is on comparatively high ground, the summit of the divide between the basins of the West Fork and East Fork of Indiana's White River. Accordingly, there are no major watercourses within the city, nor is much groundwater available for wells. The largest stream within the city is Clear Creek, with its eastern branch known on the Indiana University campus as the Campus River, formerly the Jordan River.\nBecause natural lakes or rivers or groundwater are absent from the city and its environs, a number of dams have been constructed on nearby creeks over the last 100 years to provide for the water needs of Bloomington and Monroe County. Early 20th-century damming projects occurred at locations southwest of the city, the most notable being the Leonard Springs Dam. Because of the limestone formations underlying the reservoirs and the dams, water kept seeping from the reservoirs through naturally developing underground channels. Despite all efforts, the city was never able to fully stop the leakage and had to resort to pumping leaking water back to the reservoir.\nBy the 1920s, a more radical solution was needed to deal with the water crisis. A new reservoir, known as Griffy Lake, was constructed in a more geologically suitable area north of the city. (It is now within Bloomington's official city limits.) Later, in the 1950s, two much larger reservoirs, Lake Lemon and Monroe Lake were created in the northeastern and southeastern parts of Monroe County. Monroe Lake was created by the US Army Corps of Engineers for flood control but has since been used to supply the city and the county with water. The water pumping station at Griffy Lake was mothballed until May 2020.\nPresently, the city is supplied with drinking water from Monroe Lake, via the Monroe Water Treatment Plant on S. Shields Ridge Rd. Originally opened in 1967, it was expanded in 2014, and now is capable of producing 30 million gallons of water per day. The sewer water from the northern part of the city is treated at the Blucher Poole Wastewater Treatment Plant (constructed 1968) and discharged into the Bean Blossom Creek. The sewer water from the southern half of the city goes to Dillman Road Wastewater Treatment Plant (constructed 1982) and is then discharged into the Clear Creek.\n\nEnvironment\nPCB pollution, associated with Westinghouse's operations, long was a concern in the area. A number of sites, in particular, Bennett's Dump and Lemon Lane Landfill at the northwestern edge of the city and Neal's Landfill in the county, were listed as Superfund sites. Clean-up operations at the Bennett Quarry site, started in 1983, were largely completed by 2000., while cleanups at the other sites were completed in 2012.\n\nDemographics\nBloomington is the principal city of the Bloomington metropolitan area, Indiana, a metropolitan statistical area that covers Greene, Monroe, and Owen counties and had a combined population of 192,714 at the 2010 census.\n\n2010 census\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 80,405 people, 31,425 households, and 11,267 families residing in the city.

        "content": "The Taliban (; Pashto: طَالِبَانْ, romanized: ṭālibān, lit. 'students'), which also refers to itself by its state name, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, is an Afghan political and militant movement with an ideology comprising elements of Pashtun nationalism and the Deobandi movement of Islamic fundamentalism. It ruled approximately 75% of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, before it was overthrown by an American invasion after the September 11th attacks carried out by the Taliban's ally al-Qaeda. The Taliban recaptured Kabul in August 2021 following the departure of coalition forces, after 20 years of Taliban insurgency, and now controls the entire country. The Taliban government is not recognized by any country and has been internationally condemned for restricting human rights, including women's rights to work and have an education.\nThe Taliban emerged in 1994 as a prominent faction in the Afghan Civil War and largely consisted of students from the Pashtun areas of east and south Afghanistan, who had been educated in traditional Islamic schools (madāris). Under the leadership of Mullah Omar (r. 1996–2001), the movement spread through most of Afghanistan, shifting power away from the Mujahideen warlords. In 1996, the group established the First Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The Taliban's government was opposed by the Northern Alliance militia, which seized parts of northeast Afghanistan and maintained international recognition as a continuation of the Islamic State of Afghanistan.\nDuring their rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban enforced a strict interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law, and were widely condemned for massacres against Afghan civilians, harsh discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities, denial of UN food supplies to starving civilians, destruction of cultural monuments, banning women from school and most employment, and prohibition of most music. The Taliban committed a cultural genocide against Afghans by destroying their historical and cultural texts, artifacts and sculptures. The Taliban held control of most of the country until the United States invasion of Afghanistan in December 2001. Many members of the Taliban fled to neighboring Pakistan.\nAfter being overthrown, the Taliban launched an insurgency to fight the US-backed Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in the War in Afghanistan. In May 2002, exiled members formed the Council of Leaders based in Quetta, Pakistan. Under Hibatullah Akhundzada's leadership, in May 2021, the Taliban launched a military offensive, that culminated in the Fall of Kabul in August 2021 and the Taliban regaining control. The Islamic Republic was dissolved and the Islamic Emirate reestablished. Following their return to power, the Afghanistan government budget lost 80% of its funding and food insecurity became widespread. The Taliban returned Afghanistan to many policies implemented under its previous rule, including banning women from holding almost any jobs, requiring women to wear head-to-toe coverings such as the burqa, blocking women from travelling without male guardians, and banning all education for girls.\n\nEtymology\nThe word Taliban is Pashto, طَالِباَنْ (ṭālibān), meaning \"students\", the plural of ṭālib. This is a loanword from Arabic طَالِبْ (ṭālib), using the Pashto plural ending -ān اَنْ. (In Arabic طَالِبَانْ (ṭālibān) means not \"students\" but rather \"two students\", as it is a dual form, the Arabic plural being طُلَّابْ (ṭullāb)—occasionally causing some confusion to Arabic speakers.) Since becoming a loanword in English, Taliban, besides a plural noun referring to the group, has also been used as a singular noun referring to an individual. For example, John Walker Lindh has been referred to as \"an American Taliban\" rather than \"an American Talib\" in domestic media. This is different in Afghanistan, where a member or a supporter of the group is referred to as a Talib (طَالِبْ) or its plural Talib-ha (طَالِبْهَا). In other definitions, Taliban means 'seekers'.\nIn English, the spelling Taliban has gained predominance over the spelling Taleban. In American English, the definite article is used, the group is referred to as \"the Taliban\", rather than \"Taliban\". In English-language media in Pakistan, the definite article is always omitted. Both Pakistani and Indian English-language media tend to name the group \"Afghan Taliban\", thus distinguishing it from the Pakistani Taliban. Additionally, in Pakistan, the word Talibans is often used when referring to more than one Taliban member.\nIn Afghanistan, the Taliban is frequently called the گرُوهْ طَالِبَانْ (Goroh-e Taleban), Dari term which means 'Taliban group'. As per Dari/Persian grammar, there is no \"the\" prefix. Meanwhile, in Pashto, a determiner is normally used and as a result, the group is normally referred to as per Pashto grammar: دَ طَالِبَانْ (Da Taliban) or دَ طَالِبَانُو (Da Talibano).\n\nBackground\nSoviet intervention in Afghanistan (1978–1992)\nAfter the Soviet Union intervened and occupied Afghanistan in 1979, Islamic mujahideen fighters waged a war against Soviet forces. During the Soviet–Afghan War, nearly all of the Taliban's original leaders had fought for either the Hezb-i Islami Khalis or the Harakat-i Inqilab-e Islami factions of the Mujahideen.\nPakistan's President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq feared that the Soviets were also planning to invade Balochistan, Pakistan, so he sent Akhtar Abdur Rahman to Saudi Arabia to garner support for the Afghan resistance against Soviet occupation forces. A while later, the US CIA and the Saudi Arabian General Intelligence Directorate (GID) funnelled funding and equipment through the Pakistani Inter-Service Intelligence Agency (ISI) to the Afghan mujahideen. About 90,000 Afghans, including Mullah Omar, were trained by Pakistan's ISI during the 1980s.\n\nAfghan Civil War (1992–1996)\nIn April 1992, after the fall of the Soviet-backed régime of Mohammad Najibullah, many Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement, the Peshawar Accord, which created the Islamic State of Afghanistan and appointed an interim government for a transitional period. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, Hezbe Wahdat, and Ittihad-i Islami did not participate. The state was paralysed from the start, due to rival groups contending for total power over Kabul and Afghanistan.\nHekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin party refused to recognise the interim government, and in April infiltrated Kabul to take power for itself, thus starting this civil war. In May, Hekmatyar started attacks against government forces and Kabul. Hekmatyar received operational, financial and military support from Pakistan's ISI. With that help, Hekmatyar's forces were able to destroy half of Kabul. Iran assisted the Hezbe Wahdat forces of Abdul-Ali Mazari. Saudi Arabia supported the Ittihad-i Islami faction. The conflict between these militias also escalated into war.\nDue to this sudden initiation of civil war, working government departments, police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form. Atrocities were committed by individuals inside different factions. Ceasefires, negotiated by representatives of the Islamic State's newly appointed Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud, President Sibghatullah Mojaddedi and later President Burhanuddin Rabbani (the interim government), or officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), commonly collapsed within days. The countryside in northern Afghanistan, parts of which were under the control of Defense Minister Massoud, remained calm and some reconstruction took place. The city of Herat under the rule of Islamic State ally Ismail Khan also witnessed relative calm. Meanwhile, southern Afghanistan was neither under the control of foreign-backed militias nor the government in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as Gul Agha Sherzai and their militias.\n\nHistory\nThe Taliban movement originated in Pashtun nationalism, and its ideological underpinnings are with that of broader Afghan society. The Taliban's roots lie in the religious schools of Kandahar and were influenced significantly by foreign support, particularly from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, during the Soviet–Afghan War. They emerged in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, capturing Kandahar and expanding their control across the country; they became involved in a war with the Northern Alliance. The international response to the Taliban varied, with some countries providing support while others opposed and did not recognize their regime.\nDuring their rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban implemented strict religious regulations, notably affecting women's rights and cultural heritage. This period included significant ethnic persecution and the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan. After the US-led invasion in 2001, the Taliban were ousted from power but regrouped and launched an insurgency that lasted two decades.\nThe Taliban returned to power in 2021 following the US withdrawal. Their efforts to establish the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan continue, with education policies and international relations, including internal and external challenges faced by the Taliban regime.\n\n2021 offensive and return to power\nIn mid 2021, the Taliban led a major offensive in Afghanistan during the withdrawal of US troops from the country, which gave them control of over half of Afghanistan's 421 districts as of 23 July 2021. By mid-August 2021, the Taliban controlled every major city in Afghanistan; following the near seizure of the capital Kabul, the Taliban occupied the Presidential Palace after the incumbent President Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan to the United Arab Emirates. Ghani's Asylum was confirmed by the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation on 18 August 2021. Remaining Afghan forces under the leadership of Amrullah Saleh, Ahmad Massoud, and Bismillah Khan Mohammadi retreated to Panjshir to continue resistance.\n\nIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan (2021–present)\nThe Taliban had \"seized power from an established government backed by some of the world's best-equipped militaries\"; and as an ideological insurgent movement dedicated to \"bringing about a truly Islamic state\" its victory has been compared to that of the  Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949 or Iranian Revolution of 1979, with their \"sweeping\" remake of society. However, as of 2021–2022, senior Taliban leaders  have emphasized the \"softness\" of their revolution and how they desired \"good relations\" with the United States, in discussions with American journalist Jon Lee Anderson.\nAnderson notes that the Taliban's war against any \"graven images\", so vigorous in their early rule, has been abandoned, perhaps made impossible by smartphones and Instagram. One local observer (Sayed Hamid Gailani) has argued the Taliban have not killed \"a lot\" of people after returning to power. Women are seen out on the street, Zabihullah Mujahid (acting Deputy Minister of Information and Culture) noted there are still women working in a number of government ministries, and claimed that girls will be allowed to attend secondary education when bank funds are unfrozen and the government can fund \"separate\" spaces and transportation for them.\nWhen asked about the slaughter of Hazara Shia by the first Taliban régime, Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban nominee for Ambassador to the U.N. told Anderson \"The Hazara Shia for us are also Muslim. We believe we are one, like flowers in a garden.\" In late 2021, journalists from The New York Times embedded with a six-man Taliban unit tasked with protecting the Shi'ite Sakhi Shrine in Kabul from the Islamic State, noting \"how seriously the men appeared to take their assignment.\" The unit's commander said that \"We do not care which ethnic group we serve, our goal is to serve and provide security for Afghans.\" In response to \"international criticism\" over lack of diversity, an ethnic Hazara was appointed deputy health minister, and an ethnic Tajik appointed deputy trade minister.\nOn the other hand, the Ministry of Women's Affairs has been closed and its building is the new home of Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. According to Anderson, some women still employed by the government are \"being forced to sign in at their jobs and then go home, to create the illusion of equity\"; and the appointment of ethnic minorities has been dismissed by an \"adviser to the Taliban\" as tokenism.\nReports have \"circulated\" of\n\n\"Hazara farmers being forced from their land by ethnic Pashtuns, of raids of activists' homes, and of extrajudicial executions of former government soldiers and intelligence agents\".\nAccording to a Human Rights Watch's report released in November 2021, the Taliban killed or forcibly disappeared more than 100 former members of the Afghan security forces in the three months since the takeover in just the four provinces of Ghazni, Helmand, Kandahar, and Kunduz. According to the report, the Taliban identified targets for arrest and execution through intelligence operations and access to employment records that were left behind. Former members of the security forces were also killed by the Taliban within days of registering with them to receive a letter guaranteeing their safety.\nDespite Taliban claims that the ISIS has been defeated, IS carried out suicide bombings in October 2021 at Shia mosques in Kunduz and Kandahar, killing over 115 people. As of late 2021, there were still \"sticky bomb\" explosions \"every few days\" in the capital Kabul.\nExplanations for the relative moderation of the new Taliban government and statements from its officials such as – \"We have started a new page. We do not want to be entangled with the past,\" –?include that it did not expect to take over the country so quickly and still had \"problems to work out among\" their factions\";  that $7 billion in Afghan government funds in US banks has been frozen, and that the 80% of the previous government's budget that came from \"the United States, its partners, or international lenders\", has been shut off, creating  serious economic crisis; according to the U.N. World Food Program country director, Mary Ellen McGroarty, as of late 2021, early 2022 \"22.8 million Afghans are already severely food insecure, and seven million of them are one step away from famine\"; and that the world community  has \"unanimously\" asked the Taliban \"to form an inclusive government, ensure the rights of women and minorities and guarantee that Afghanistan will no more serve as the launching pad for global terrorist operations\", before it recognizes the Taliban government.  In conversation with journalist Anderson, senior Taliban leaders implied that the harsh application of sharia during their first era of rule in the 1990s was necessary because of the \"depravity\" and \"chaos\" that remained from the  Soviet occupation, but that now  \"mercy and compassion\" were the order of the day. This was contradicted by former senior members of the Ministry of Women's Affairs, one of which who told Anderson, \"they will do anything to convince the international community to give them financing, but eventually I'll be forced to wear the burqa again. They are just waiting.\"\nAfter Taliban retook power in 2021, border clashes erupted between the Taliban with its neighbors includes Iran and Pakistan, leading to casualties on both sides.\nIn the early months of Taliban rule, international journalists have had some access to Afghanistan. In February 2022, several international journalists, including Andrew North were detained. The Committee to Protect Journalists described their detention as \"a sad reflection of the overall decline of press freedom and increasing attacks on journalists under Taliban rule.\" The journalists were released after several days. Subsequently, watchdog organizations have continued to document a number of arrests of local journalists, as well as barring access to international journalists.\nThe country's small community of Sikhs - who form Afghanistan's second largest religion - as well as Hindus, have reportedly been prevented from celebrating their holidays as of 2023 by the Taliban government. Despite this, the Taliban in a later statement praised the communities and assured that their private land and property will be secured. In April 2024, the former sole Sikh member of parliament, Narendra Singh Khalsa, returned to Afghanistan for the first time since the collapse of the Republic.\n\nCurrent education policy\nIn September 2021, the government ordered primary schools to reopen for both sexes and announced plans to reopen secondary schools for male students, without committing to do the same for female students. While the Taliban stated that female college students will be able to resume higher education provided that they are segregated from male students (and professors, when possible), The Guardian noted that \"if the high schools do not reopen for girls, the commitments to allow university education would become meaningless once the current cohort of students graduated.\" Higher Education Minister Abdul Baqi Haqqani said that female university students will be required to observe proper hijab, but did not specify if this required covering the face.\nKabul University reopened in February 2022, with female students attending in the morning and males in the afternoon. Other than the closure of the music department, few changes to the curriculum were reported. Female students were officially required to wear an abaya and a hijab to attend, although some wore a shawl instead. Attendance was reportedly low on the first day.\nIn March 2022, the Taliban abruptly halted plans to allow girls to resume secondary school education even when separated from males. At the time, The Washington Post reported that apart from university students, \"sixth is now the highest grade girls may attend\". The Afghan Ministry of Education cited the lack of an acceptable design for female student uniforms.\nOn December 20, 2022, in violation of their prior promises, the Taliban banned female students from attending higher education institutions with immediate effect. The following day, December 21, 2022, the Taliban instituted a ban on all education for all girls and women around the country alongside a ban on female staff in schools, including teaching professions. Teaching was one of the last few remaining professions open to women.\n\nIdeology and aims\nThe Taliban's ideology has been described as an \"innovative form of sharia combining Pashtun tribal codes\", or Pashtunwali, with radical Deobandi interpretations of Islam favoured by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and its splinter groups. Their ideology was a departure from the Islamism of the anti-Soviet mujahideen rulers and the radical Islamists inspired by the Sayyid Qutb (Ikhwan). The Taliban have said they aim to restore peace and security to Afghanistan, including Western troops leaving, and to enforce Sharia, or Islamic law, once in power.\nAccording to journalist Ahmed Rashid, at least in the first years of their rule, the Taliban adopted Deobandi and Islamist anti-nationalist beliefs, and they opposed \"tribal and feudal structures\", removing traditional tribal or feudal leaders from leadership roles.\nThe Taliban strictly enforced their ideology in major cities like Herat, Kabul, and Kandahar. But in rural areas, the Taliban had little direct control, and as a result, they promoted village jirgas, so in rural areas, they did not enforce their ideology as stringently as they enforced it in cities.\n\nIdeological influences\nThe Taliban's religious/political philosophy, especially during its first régime from 1996 to 2001, was heavily advised and influenced by Grand Mufti Rashid Ahmed Ludhianvi and his works. Its operating political and religious principles since its founding, however, was modelled on those of Abul A'la Maududi and the Jamaat-e-Islami movement.\n\nPashtun cultural influences\nThe Taliban, being largely Pashtun tribesmen, frequently follow a pre-Islamic cultural tribal code which is focused on preserving honour. Pashtunwali strongly influences decisions in regards to other social matters. It is best described as subconscious social values and attitudes which promote various qualities such as bravery, preserving honour, being hospitable to all guests, seeking revenge and justice if one has been wronged, and providing sanctuary to anyone who seeks refuge, even if it is an enemy. However, non-Pashtuns and others usually criticize some of the values such as the Pashtun practice of equally dividing inheritances among sons, even though the Qur'an clearly states that women are supposed to receive one-half of a man's share.\nAccording to Ali A. Jalali and Lester Grau, the Taliban \"received extensive support from Pashtuns across the country who thought that the movement might restore their national dominance. Even Pashtun intellectuals in the West, who differed with the Taliban on many issues, expressed support for the movement on purely ethnic grounds.\"\n\nIslamic rules under Deobandi philosophy\nWritten works published by the group's Commission of Cultural Affairs including Islami Adalat, De Mujahid Toorah –  De Jihad Shari Misalay, and Guidance to the Mujahideen outlined the core of the Taliban Islamic Movement's philosophy regarding jihad, sharia, organization, and conduct. The Taliban régime interpreted the Sharia law in accordance with the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence and the religious edicts of Mullah Omar. The Taliban, Mullah Omar in particular, emphasised dreams as a means of revelation.\n\nProhibitions\nThe Taliban forbade the consumption of pork and alcohol, the use of many types of consumer technology such as music with instrumental accompaniments, television, filming, and the Internet, as well as most forms of art such as paintings or photography, participation in sports, including football and chess; Recreational activities such as kite-flying and the keeping of pigeons and other pets were also forbidden, and the birds were killed according to the Taliban's rules. Movie theatres were closed and repurposed as mosques. The celebration of the Western and Iranian New Years was also forbidden. Taking photographs and displaying pictures and portraits were also forbidden, because the Taliban considered them forms of idolatry. This extended even to \"blacking out illustrations on packages of baby soap in shops and painting over road-crossing signs for livestock.\nWomen were banned from working, girls were forbidden to attend schools or universities, were required to observe purdah (physical separation of the sexes) and awrah (concealing the body with clothing), and to be accompanied by male relatives outside their households; those who violated these restrictions were punished. Men were forbidden to shave their beards and they were also required to let them grow and keep them long according to the Taliban's rules, and they were also required to wear turbans outside their households. Prayer was made compulsory and those men who did not respect the religious obligation after the azaan were arrested. Gambling was banned, and the Taliban punished thieves by amputating their hands or feet. In 2000, the Taliban's leader Mullah Omar officially banned opium cultivation and drug trafficking in Afghanistan; the Taliban succeeded in nearly eradicating the majority of the opium production (99%) by 2001. During the Taliban's governance of Afghanistan, drug users and dealers were both severely persecuted.\n\nViews on the Bamyan Buddhas\nIn 1999, Mullah Omar issued a decree in which he called for the protection of the Buddha statues at Bamyan, two 6th-century monumental statues of standing buddhas which were carved into the side of a cliff in the Bamyan valley in the Hazarajat region of central Afghanistan. But in March 2001, the Taliban destroyed the statues, following a decree by Mullah Omar which stated: \"all the statues around Afghanistan must be destroyed.\"\nYahya Massoud, brother of the anti-Taliban and resistance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud, recalls the following incident after the destruction of the Buddha statues at Bamyan:\n\nIt was the spring of 2001. I was in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, together with my brother Ahmad Shah Massoud, the leader of the Afghan resistance against the Taliban, and Bismillah Khan, who currently serves as Afghanistan's interior minister. One of our commanders, Commandant Momin, wanted us to see 30 Taliban fighters who had been taken hostage after a gun battle. My brother agreed to meet them.\nI remember that his first question concerned the centuries-old Buddha statues that were dynamited by the Taliban in March of that year, shortly before our encounter. Two Taliban combatants from Kandahar confidently responded that worshiping anything outside of Islam was unacceptable and that therefore these statues had to be destroyed. My brother looked at them and said, this time in Pashto, 'There are still many sun- worshippers in this country. Will you also try to get rid of the sun and drop darkness over the Earth?'\n\nViews on bacha bazi\nThe Afghan custom of bacha bazi, a form of pederastic sexual slavery, child sexual abuse and pedophilia which is traditionally practiced in various provinces of Afghanistan between older men and young adolescent \"dancing boys\", was also forbidden under the six-year rule of the Taliban régime. Under the rule of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, it carried the death penalty.\nThe practice remained illegal during the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's rule, but the laws were seldom enforced against powerful offenders and police had reportedly been complicit in related crimes. A controversy arose during the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's rule, after allegations surfaced that US government forces in Afghanistan after the invasion of the country deliberately ignored bacha bazi. The US military responded by claiming the abuse was largely the responsibility of the \"local Afghan government\". The Taliban has criticized the US role in the abuse of Afghan children.\n\nAttitudes towards other Muslim communities\nUnlike other Islamic fundamentalist organizations, the Taliban are not Salafists. Although wealthy Arab nations had brought Salafist Madrasas to Afghanistan during the Soviet war in the 1980s, the Taliban's strict Deobandi leadership suppressed the Salafi movement in Afghanistan after it first came to power in the 1990s. Following the 2001 US invasion, the Taliban and Salafists joined forces in order to wage a common war against NATO forces, but Salafists were relegated to small groups which were under the Taliban's command.\nThe Taliban are averse to debating doctrine with other Muslims and \"did not allow even Muslim reporters to question [their] edicts or to discuss interpretations of the Qur'an.\"\n\nOpposition to Salafism\nFollowing the Taliban victory, a nationwide campaign was launched against influential Salafi factions suspected of past ties to the ISIS–K. The Taliban closed most Salafi mosques and seminaries in 16 provinces, including Nangarhar, and detained clerics it accused of supporting the Islamic State.\n\nShia Islam\nDuring the period of the first Taliban rule (1996 to 2001), the Taliban attempted to sway Shias, particularly Hazaras, to their side, making deals with a number of Shia political figures, as well as securing the support of some Shia religious scholars. One of these was Ustad Muhammad Akbari, a Shia Hazara politician who separated from Abdul-Ali Mazari's Islamic Unity Party to form the National Islamic Unity Party, thereafter politically aligning himself and his group, which gained the support of the majority of Islamic Unity Party members in the Hazara hinterland, with the Taliban. Another significant Shia political figure in the administration of the first Islamic Emirate was Sayed Gardizi, a Sayed Hazara from Gardiz, who was appointed as the wuluswal (district governor) of Yakawlang district, being the only Shia to hold the position of district governor during the period of the first Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\nAt the same time, however, certain incidents caused distrust between the Taliban and Afghan Shias. The 1998 Mazar-i-Sharif massacre was the most significant, having taken place in response to ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdur-Rashid Dustum's betrayal and subsequent massacre of Taliban fighters, as well as false rumors that Hazaras had beheaded senior Taliban leader Mawlawi Ihsanullah Ihsan at the grave of Abdul-Ali Mazari, which led to the massacre of a significant number of Hazaras. The commander responsible for the massacre, Abdul-Manan Niazi, later became notable for his opposition to the Taliban's leadership, having formed the rebellious High Council of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in 2015, before being killed, reportedly by the Taliban themselves.\n\nThe desire of the Taliban leadership to expand the group's relations with Afghan Shias continued after the American invasion of Afghanistan and the group's return to insurgency. Some time following the American Invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Taliban published \"A Message to the Mujahid People of Iraq and Afghanistan\" by Mullah Omar, in which he condemned sectarianism whilst jointly addressing the people of Iraq and Afghanistan, saying:\"It's incumbent upon all Muslims to thwart all the cursed plots of the cunning enemy, and to not give him the opportunity to light the fires of disagreement amongst the Muslims. A major component of American policy is to categorize the Muslims in Iraq with the labels of Shī’ah and Sunnī, and in Afghanistan with the labels of Pashtun, Tājīk, Hazārah and Uzbek, in order to decrease the severity and strength of the popular uprisings and the accompanying armed resistance. […] As such, I request the brothers in Iraq to put behind them the differences that exist in the name of Shī’ah and Sunnī, and to fight in unity against the occupying enemy, for victory is not possible without unity.\"Multiple Hazara Shia Taliban commanders took part in the Taliban insurgency, primarily from Bamyan and Daikundi provinces. Among the Qarabaghi tribe of Shia Hazaras, a number of fighters voluntarily joined the Taliban, due to their close relations with the nearby Taliban-supporting Sunni Pashtun population. Additionally, a pro-government Shia Hazara militia from Gizab district of Daikundi province, called Fedayi, defected and pledged allegiance to the Taliban a few years prior to 2016, with a reported size of 50 fighters.\nIn reaction to the 2011 Afghanistan Ashura bombings, which targeted Shia Afghans in Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif, the Taliban published \"Sectarian Killings; A Dangerous Enemy Conspiracy\" by Taliban official Abdul-Qahhar Balkhi, in which he stated:\n\n\"In Afghanistan, Sunnis and Shias have co-existed for centuries. They live communal lives and participate in their mutual festivities. And for centuries they have fought shoulder to shoulder against foreign invaders. [...] The majority of Shia populations in Bamyan, Daikundi and Hazarajat [have] actively aided and continue to support the Mujahideen against the foreigners and their puppets. The foreign occupiers seek to ignite the flames of communal hatred and violence between Sunnis and Shias in Afghanistan. [...] The followers of Islam will only ever reclaim their rightful place in this world if they forgo their petty differences and unite as a single egalitarian body.\"\nIn recent years, the Taliban have once again attempted to court Shiites, appointing a Shia cleric as a regional governor and recruiting Hazaras to fight against ISIS–K, in order to distance themselves from their past reputation and improve their relations with the Shia-led Government of Iran. After the 2021 Taliban offensive, which led to the restoration of the Islamic Emirate, senior Taliban officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Salam Hanafi and Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, have stressed the importance of unity between Shiites and Sunnis in Afghanistan and promised to protect the Shiite community. The Ministry of Virtue and Vice have also agreed to hire Shia Ulama in order to implement the ministry's religious edicts. In general, the Taliban has maintained peace with most Muslims in the Shiite community, although the 2022 Balkhab uprising resulted in the deaths of some Hazaras.\n\nConsistency of the Taliban's ideology\nThe Taliban's ideology is not static. Before its capture of Kabul, members of the Taliban talked about stepping aside once a government of \"good Muslims\" took power and once law and order were restored. The decision-making process of the Taliban in Kandahar was modelled on the Pashtun tribal council (jirga), together with what was believed to be the early Islamic model. Discussion was followed by the building of a consensus by the believers.\nAs the Taliban's power grew, Mullah Omar made decisions without consulting the jirga or visiting other parts of the country. He visited the capital, Kabul, only twice while he was in power. Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil explained:\n\nDecisions are based on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us consultation is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the Sharia. We abide by the Amir's view even if he alone takes this view. There will not be a head of state. Instead there will be an Amir al-Mu'minin. Mullah Omar will be the highest authority and the government will not be able to implement any decision to which he does not agree. General elections are incompatible with Sharia and therefore we reject them.\nAnother sign that the Taliban's ideology was evolving was Mullah Omar's 1999 decree in which he called for the protection of the Buddha statues at Bamyan and the destruction of them in 2001.\n\nEvaluations and criticisms\nThe author Ahmed Rashid suggests that the devastation and hardship which resulted from the Soviet invasion and the period which followed it influenced the Taliban's ideology. It is said that the Taliban did not include scholars who were learned in Islamic law and history. The refugee students, brought up in a totally male society, not only had no education in mathematics, science, history or geography, but also had no traditional skills of farming, herding, or handicraft-making, nor even knowledge of their tribal and clan lineages. In such an environment, war meant employment, peace meant unemployment. Dominating women simply affirmed manhood. For their leadership, rigid fundamentalism was a matter not only of principle, but also of political survival. Taliban leaders \"repeatedly told\" Rashid that \"if they gave women greater freedom or a chance to go to school, they would lose the support of their rank and file.\"\n\nThe Taliban have been criticized for their strictness towards those who disobeyed their imposed rules, and Mullah Omar has been criticized for titling himself Amir al-Mu'minin.\nMullah Omar was criticized for calling himself Amir al-Mu'minin on the grounds that he lacked scholarly learning, tribal pedigree, or connections to the Prophet's family. Sanction for the title traditionally required the support of all of the country's ulema, whereas only some 1,200 Pashtun Taliban-supporting Mullahs had declared that Omar was the Amir. According to Ahmed Rashid, \"no Afghan had adopted the title since 1834, when King Dost Mohammed Khan assumed the title before he declared jihad against the Sikh kingdom in Peshawar. But Dost Mohammed was fighting foreigners, while Omar had declared jihad against other Afghans.\"\nAnother criticism was that the Taliban called their 20% tax on truckloads of opium \"zakat\", which is traditionally limited to 2.5% of the zakat-payers' disposable income (or wealth).\nThe Taliban have been compared to the 7th-century Kharijites who developed extreme doctrines which set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to takfir, whereby they declared that other Muslims were unbelievers and deemed them worthy of death.\nIn particular, the Taliban have been accused of takfir towards Shia. After the August 1998 slaughter of 8,000 mostly Shia Hazara non-combatants in Mazar-i-Sharif, Mullah Abdul Manan Niazi, the Taliban commander of the attack and the new governor of Mazar, who was later killed by the Taliban after forming the rebellious High Council of the Islamic Emirate, declared from Mazar's central mosque:\n\nLast year you rebelled against us and killed us. From all your homes you shot at us. Now we are here to deal with you. The Hazaras are not Muslims and now have to kill Hazaras. You either accept to be Muslims or leave Afghanistan. Wherever you go we will catch you. If you go up we will pull you down by your feet; if you hide below, we will pull you up by your hair.Carter Malkasian, in one of the first comprehensive historical works on the Afghan war, argues that the Taliban are oversimplified in most portrayals. While Malkasian thinks that \"oppressive\" remains the best word to describe them, he points out that the Taliban managed to do what multiple governments and political players failed to: bring order and unity to the \"ungovernable land\". The Taliban curbed the atrocities and excesses of the Warlord period of the civil war from 1992–1996. Malkasian further argues that the Taliban's imposing of Islamic ideals upon the Afghan tribal system was innovative and a key reason for their success and durability. Given that traditional sources of authority had been shown to be weak in the long period of civil war, only religion had proved strong in Afghanistan. In a period of 40 years of constant conflict, the traditionalist Islam of the Taliban proved to be far more stable, even if the order they brought was \"an impoverished peace\".: 50–51\n\nCondemned practices\nThe Taliban have been internationally condemned for their harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law, which has resulted in their brutal treatment of many Afghans. During their rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban enforced a strict interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. The Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians, denied UN food supplies to 160,000 starving civilians, and conducted a policy of scorched earth, burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes. While the Taliban controlled Afghanistan, they banned activities and media including paintings, photography, and movies that depicted people or other living things. They also prohibited music with instrumental accompaniments, with the exception of the daf, a type of frame drum. The Taliban prevented girls and young women from attending school, banned women from working jobs outside of healthcare (male doctors were prohibited from treating women), and required that women be accompanied by a male relative and wear a burqa at all times when in public. If women broke certain rules, they were publicly whipped or executed. The Taliban harshly discriminated against religious and ethnic minorities during their rule and they have also committed a cultural genocide against the people of Afghanistan by destroying numerous monuments, including the famous 1500-year-old Buddhas of Bamiyan. According to the United Nations, the Taliban and their allies were responsible for 76% of Afghan civilian casualties in 2010, and 80% in 2011 and 2012. The group is internally funded by its involvement in the illegal drug trade which it participates in by producing and trafficking in narcotics such as heroin, extortion, and kidnapping for ransom. They also seized control of mining operations in the mid-2010s that were illegal under the previous government.\n\nMassacre campaigns\nAccording to a 55-page report by the United Nations, the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians. UN officials stated that there had been \"15 massacres\" between 1996 and 2001. They also said, that \"[t]hese have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the [Taliban] Ministry of Defense or to Mullah Omar himself.\" \"These are the same type of war crimes as were committed in Bosnia and should be prosecuted in international courts\", one UN official was quoted as saying. The documents also reveal the role of Arab and Pakistani support troops in these killings. Bin Laden's so-called 055 Brigade was responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians. The report by the United Nations quotes \"eyewitnesses in many villages describing Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people\". The Taliban's former ambassador to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, in late 2011 stated that cruel behaviour under and by the Taliban had been \"necessary\".\nIn 1998, the United Nations accused the Taliban of denying emergency food by the UN's World Food Programme to 160,000 hungry and starving people \"for political and military reasons\". The UN said the Taliban were starving people for their military agenda and using humanitarian assistance as a weapon of war.\nOn 8 August 1998, the Taliban launched an attack on Mazar-i-Sharif. Of 1500 defenders only 100 survived the engagement. Once in control the Taliban began to kill people indiscriminately. At first shooting people in the street, they soon began to target Hazaras. Women were raped, and thousands of people were locked in containers and left to suffocate. This ethnic cleansing left an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 people dead. At this time ten Iranian diplomats and a journalist were killed. Iran assumed the Taliban had murdered them, and mobilised its army, deploying men along the border with Afghanistan. By the middle of September there were 250,000 Iranian personnel stationed on the border. Pakistan mediated and the bodies were returned to Tehran towards the end of the month. The killings of the diplomats had been carried out by Sipah-e-Sahaba, a Pakistani Sunni group with close ties to the ISI. They burned orchards, crops and destroyed irrigation systems, and forced more than 100,000 people from their homes with hundreds of men, women and children still unaccounted for.\nIn a major effort to retake the Shomali Plains to the north of Kabul from the United Front, the Taliban indiscriminately killed civilians, while uprooting and expelling the population. Among others, Kamal Hossein, a special reporter for the UN, reported on these and other war crimes. In Istalif, a town famous for handmade potteries and which was home to more than 45,000 people, the Taliban gave 24 hours' notice to the population to leave, then completely razed the town leaving the people destitute.\nIn 1999, the town of Bamian was taken, hundreds of men, women and children were executed. Houses were razed and some were used for forced labour. There was a further massacre at the town of Yakaolang in January 2001. An estimated 300 people were murdered, along with two delegations of Hazara elders who had tried to intercede.\nBy 1999, the Taliban had forced hundreds of thousands of people from the Shomali Plains and other regions conducting a policy of scorched earth burning homes, farm land and gardens.\n\nHuman trafficking\nSeveral Taliban and al-Qaeda commanders ran a network of human trafficking, abducting ethnic minority women and selling them into sex slavery in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Time magazine writes: \"The Taliban often argued that the restrictions they placed on women were actually a way of revering and protecting the opposite sex. The behavior of the Taliban during the six years they expanded their rule in Afghanistan made a mockery of that claim.\"\nThe targets for human trafficking were especially women from the Tajik, Uzbek, Hazara and other non-Pashtun ethnic groups in Afghanistan. Some women preferred to commit suicide over slavery, killing themselves. During one Taliban and al-Qaeda offensive in 1999 in the Shomali Plains alone, more than 600 women were kidnapped. Arab and Pakistani al-Qaeda militants, with local Taliban forces, forced them into trucks and buses. Time magazine writes: \"The trail of the missing Shomali women leads to Jalalabad, not far from the Pakistan border. There, according to eyewitnesses, the women were penned up inside Sar Shahi camp in the desert. The more desirable among them were selected and taken away. Some were trucked to Peshawar with the apparent complicity of Pakistani border guards. Others were taken to Khost, where bin Laden had several training camps.\" Officials from relief agencies say, the trail of many of the vanished women leads to Pakistan where they were sold to brothels or into private households to be kept as slaves.\n\nOppression of women\nTo PHR's knowledge, no other régime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual house arrest, prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment.\n\nBrutal repression of women was widespread under the Taliban and it received significant international condemnation.  Abuses were myriad and violently enforced by the religious police. For example, the Taliban issued edicts forbidding women from being educated, forcing girls to leave schools and colleges. Women who were leaving their houses were required to be accompanied by a male relative and were obligated to wear the burqa, a traditional dress covering the entire body except for a small slit out of which to see. Those women who were accused of disobedience were publicly beaten. In one instance, a young woman named Sohaila was charged with adultery after she was caught walking with a man who was not a relative; she was publicly flogged in Ghazi Stadium, receiving 100 lashes. Female employment was restricted to the medical sector, where male medical personnel were prohibited from treating women and girls. This extensive ban on the employment of women further resulted in the widespread closure of primary schools, as almost all teachers prior to the Taliban's rise had been women, further restricting access to education not only to girls but also to boys. Restrictions became especially severe after the Taliban took control of the capital. In February 1998, for instance, religious police forced all women off the streets of Kabul and issued new regulations which ordered people to blacken their windows so that women would not be visible from outside.\n\nViolence against civilians\nAccording to the United Nations, the Taliban and its allies were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009, 75% in 2010 and 80% in 2011.\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, the Taliban's bombings and other attacks which have led to civilian casualties \"sharply escalated in 2006\" when \"at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at non-combatants.\"\n\nThe United Nations reported that the number of civilians killed by both the Taliban and pro-government forces in the war rose nearly 50% between 2007 and 2009. The high number of civilians killed by the Taliban is blamed in part on their increasing use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), \"for instance, 16 IEDs have been planted in girls' schools\" by the Taliban.\nIn 2009, Colonel Richard Kemp, formerly Commander of British forces in Afghanistan and the intelligence coordinator for the British government, drew parallels between the tactics and strategy of Hamas in Gaza to those of the Taliban. Kemp wrote:\n\nLike Hamas in Gaza, the Taliban in southern Afghanistan are masters at shielding themselves behind the civilian population and then melting in among them for protection. Women and children are trained and equipped to fight, collect intelligence, and ferry arms and ammunition between battles. Female suicide bombers are increasingly common. The use of women to shield gunmen as they engage NATO forces is now so normal it is deemed barely worthy of comment. Schools and houses are routinely booby-trapped. Snipers shelter in houses deliberately filled with women and children.\n\nDiscrimination against Hindus and Sikhs\nHindus and Sikhs have lived in Afghanistan since historic times and they were prominent minorities in Afghanistan, well-established in terms of academics and businesses. After the Afghan Civil War they started to migrate to India and other nations. After the Taliban established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, they imposed strict Sharia laws which discriminated against Hindus and Sikhs and caused the size of Afghanistan's Hindu and Sikh populations to fall at a very rapid rate because they emigrated from Afghanistan and established diasporas in the Western world. The Taliban issued decrees that forbade non-Muslims from building places of worship but allowed them to worship at existing holy sites, forbade non-Muslims from criticizing Muslims, ordered non-Muslims to identify their houses by placing a yellow cloth on their rooftops, forbade non-Muslims from living in the same residence as Muslims, and required that non-Muslim women wear a yellow dress with a special mark so that Muslims could keep their distance from them (Hindus and Sikhs were mainly targeted). The Taliban announced in May 2001 that it would force Afghanistan's Hindu population to wear special badges, which has been compared to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. In general, the Taliban treated the Sikhs better than Afghan Shiites, Hindus and Christians.\n\nRelationship with other religious groups\nAlong with Hindus, the small Christian community was also persecuted by the Taliban. Violence against Western aid workers and Christians was common during the Afghan conflict.\nOn several occasions between 2008 and 2012, the Taliban claimed that they assassinated Western and Afghani medical or aid workers in Afghanistan, because they feared that the polio vaccine would make Muslim children sterile, because they suspected that the 'medical workers' were really spies, or because they suspected that the medical workers were proselytizing Christianity.\nIn August 2008, three Western women (British, Canadian, US) who were working for the aid group 'International Rescue Committee' were murdered in Kabul. The Taliban claimed that they killed them because they were foreign spies. In October 2008, the British woman Gayle Williams working for Christian UK charity 'SERVE Afghanistan' – focusing on training and education for disabled persons – was murdered near Kabul. Taliban claimed they killed her because her organisation \"was preaching Christianity in Afghanistan\". In all 2008 until October, 29 aid workers, 5 of whom non-Afghanis, were killed in Afghanistan.\nIn August 2010, the Taliban claimed that they murdered 10 medical aid workers while they were passing through Badakhshan Province on their way from Kabul to Nuristan Province – but the Afghan Islamic party/militia Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin has also claimed responsibility for those killings. The victims were six Americans, one Briton, one German and two Afghanis, working for a self-proclaimed \"non-profit, Christian organization\" which is named 'International Assistance Mission'. The Taliban stated that they murdered them because they were proselytizing Christianity and possessing which were translated into the Dari language when they were encountered. IAM contended that they \"were not missionaries\".\nIn December 2012, unidentified gunmen killed four female UN polio-workers in Karachi in Pakistan; the Western news media suggested that there was a connection between the outspokenness of the Taliban and objections to and suspicions of such 'polio vaccinations'. Eventually in 2012, a Pakistani Taliban commander in North Waziristan in Pakistan banned polio vaccinations, and in March 2013, the Afghan government was forced to suspend its vaccination efforts in Nuristan Province because the Taliban was extremely influential in the province. However, in May 2013, the Taliban's leaders changed their stance on polio vaccinations, saying that the vaccine is the only way to prevent polio and they also stated that they will work with immunization volunteers as long as polio workers are \"unbiased\" and \"harmonized with the regional conditions, Islamic values and local cultural traditions.\"\n\nDuring the first period of Taliban rule, only two known Jews were left in Afghanistan, Zablon Simintov and Isaac Levy (c. 1920–2005). Levy relied on charity to survive, while Simintov ran a store selling carpets and jewelry until 2001. They lived on opposite sides of the dilapidated Kabul synagogue. They kept denouncing each other to the authorities, and both spent time in jail for continuously \"arguing\". The Taliban also confiscated the synagogue's Torah scroll. However, the two men were later released from prison when Taliban officials became annoyed by their arguing. After August 2021, the last Jew Simintov and his relative left Afghanistan, ended centuries of Jewish presence in the country.\n\nRestrictions on modern education\nBefore the Taliban came to power, education was highly regarded in Afghanistan and Kabul University attracted students from Asia and the Middle East. However, the Taliban imposed restrictions on modern education, banned the education of females, only allowed Islamic religious schools to stay open and only encouraged the teaching of the Qur'an. Around half of all of the schools in Afghanistan were destroyed. The Taliban have carried out brutal attacks on teachers and students and they have also threatened parents and teachers.\nAs per a 1998 UNICEF report, 9 out of 10 girls and 2 out of 3 boys did not enroll in schools. By 2000, fewer than 4–5% of all Afghan children were being educated at the primary school level and even fewer of them were being educated at higher secondary and university levels.\nAttacks on educational institutions, students and teachers and the forced enforcement of Islamic teachings have even continued after the Taliban were deposed from power. In December 2017, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that over 1,000 schools had been destroyed, damaged or occupied and 100 teachers and students had been killed by the Taliban.\n\nCultural genocide\nThe Taliban have committed a cultural genocide against the Afghan people by destroying their historical and cultural texts, artifacts and sculptures.\nIn the early 1990s, the National Museum of Afghanistan was attacked and looted numerous times, resulting in the loss of 70% of the 100,000 artifacts of Afghan culture and history which were then on display.\nOn 11 August 1998, the Taliban destroyed the Puli Khumri Public Library. The library contained a collection of over 55,000 books and old manuscripts, one of the most valuable and beautiful collections of Afghanistan's cultural works according to the Afghan people.\nOn 2 March 2001, the Buddhas of Bamiyan were destroyed with dynamite, on orders from the Taliban's leader Mullah Omar.\nIn October of the same year, the Taliban \"took sledgehammers and axes to thousands of years’ worth of artifacts\" in the National Museum of Afghanistan, destroying at least 2,750 ancient works of art.\nAfghanistan has a rich musical culture, where music plays an important part in social functions like births and marriages and it has also played a major role in uniting an ethnically diverse country. However, since it came to power and even after it was deposed, the Taliban has banned most music, including cultural folk music, and it has also attacked and killed a number of musicians.\n\nBan on entertainment and recreational activities\nDuring their first rule of Afghanistan which lasted from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban banned many recreational activities and games, such as association football, kite flying, and chess. Mediums of entertainment such as televisions, cinemas, music with instrumental accompaniments, VCRs and satellite dishes were also banned. Also included on the list of banned items were \"musical instruments and accessories\" and all visual representation of living creatures. However, the daf, a type of frame drum, wasn't banned.\nIt was reported that when Afghan children were caught kiting, a highly popular activity, they were beaten. When Khaled Hosseini learned through a 1999 news report that the Taliban had banned kite flying, a restriction he found particularly cruel, the news \"struck a personal chord\" for him, as he had grown up with the sport while living in Afghanistan. Hosseini was motivated to write a 25-page short story about two boys who fly kites in Kabul that he later developed into his first novel, The Kite Runner.\n\nForced conscription and conscription of children\nAccording to the testimony of Guantanamo captives before their Combatant Status Review Tribunals, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its civil service – both done at gunpoint.\nAccording to a report from Oxford University, the Taliban made widespread use of the conscription of children in 1997, 1998 and 1999. The report states that during the civil war that preceded the Taliban régime, thousands of orphaned boys joined various militia for \"employment, food, shelter, protection and economic opportunity.\" The report said that during its initial period, the Taliban \"long depended upon cohorts of youth\". Witnesses stated that each land-owning family had to provide one young man and $500 in expenses. In August of that year 5000 students aged between 15 and 35 left madrassas in Pakistan to join the Taliban.\n\nLeadership and organization\nKandahar faction and Haqqani network\nAccording to Jon Lee Anderson the Taliban government is \"said to be profoundly divided\" between the Kandahar faction and the Haqqani network, with a mysterious dispearance of deputy Prime Minister Abdul Ghani Baradar for \"several days\" in mid-September 2021 explained by rumours of injury after a brawl with other Taliban.  The Kandahar faction is named for the city that Mullah Omar came from and where he founded the Taliban, and is described as \"insular\" and \"rural\", interested \"primarily\" with \"ruling its home turf\". It includes Haibatullah Akhundzada, Mullah Yaqoob, Abdul Ghani Baradar (see below).\nThe family-based Haqqani network, by contrast are \"closely linked to Pakistan's secret services\", \"interested in global jihad\", with its founder (Jalaluddin Haqqani) \"connected\" the Taliban with Osama bin Laden. It is named for its founder Jalaluddin Haqqani and is currently led by Sirajuddin Haqqani, and includes Khalil Haqqani, Mawlawi Mohammad Salim Saad.\nWith  Sirajuddin Haqqani as acting interior minister, as of February 2022, the network has control of \"a preponderance of security positions in Afghanistan\".\nTaliban leadership have denied tension between factions. Suhail Shaheen states \"there is one Taliban\", and Zabihullah Mujahid (acting Deputy Minister of Information and Culture), even maintains \"there is no Haqqani network.\"\n\nCurrent leadership\nThe top members of the Taliban as an insurgency, as of August 2021, are:\n\nHaibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban's Supreme Leader since 2016, a religious scholar from Kandahar province.\nAbdul Ghani Baradar, co-founder of the movement alongside Mullah Omar, was deputy Prime Minister as of March 2022.

He revealed himself to the public for the first time after the group's capture of Kabul in 2021.\nAll the top leadership of the Taliban are ethnic Pashtuns, more specifically those belonging of the Ghilzai confederation.\n\nOverview\nUntil his death in 2013, Mullah Mullah Omar was the supreme commander of the Taliban. Mullah Akhtar Mansour was elected as his replacement in 2015, and following Mansour's killing in a May 2016 US drone strike, Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada became the group's leader.\nThe Taliban initially enjoyed goodwill from Afghans weary of the warlords' corruption, brutality, and incessant fighting.\nThis popularity was not universal, particularly among non-Pashtuns.\nIn 2001, the Taliban, de jure, controlled 85% of Afghanistan. De facto the areas under its direct control were mainly Afghanistan's major cities and highways. Tribal khans and warlords had de facto direct control over various small towns, villages, and rural areas.\n\nRashid described the Taliban government as \"a secret society run by Kandaharis ... mysterious, secretive, and dictatorial.\" They did not hold elections, as their spokesman explained:\n\nThe Sharia does not allow politics or political parties. That is why we give no salaries to officials or soldiers, just food, clothes, shoes, and weapons. We want to live a life like the Prophet lived 1400 years ago, and jihad is our right. We want to recreate the time of the Prophet, and we are only carrying out what the Afghan people have wanted for the past 14 years.\nThey modelled their decision-making process on the Pashtun tribal council (jirga), together with what they believed to be the early Islamic model. Discussion was followed by a building of a consensus by the \"believers\". Before capturing Kabul, there was talk of stepping aside once a government of \"good Muslims\" took power, and law and order were restored.\nAs the Taliban's power grew, decisions were made by Mullah Omar without consulting the jirga and without consulting other parts of the country. He visited the capital, Kabul, only twice while in power. Instead of an election, their leader's legitimacy came from an oath of allegiance (\"Bay'ah\"), in imitation of the Prophet and the first four Caliphs. On 4 April 1996, Mullah Omar had \"the Cloak of the Prophet Mohammed\" taken from its shrine for the first time in 60 years. Wrapping himself in the relic, he appeared on the roof of a building in the center of Kandahar while hundreds of Pashtun mullahs below shouted \"Amir al-Mu'minin!\" (Commander of the Faithful), in a pledge of support. Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil explained:\n\nDecisions are based on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us consultation is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the Sharia. We abide by the Amir's view even if he alone takes this view. There will not be a head of state. Instead there will be an Amir al-Mu'minin. Mullah Omar will be the highest authority, and the government will not be able to implement any decision to which he does not agree. General elections are incompatible with Sharia and therefore we reject them.\nThe Taliban were very reluctant to share power, and since their ranks were overwhelmingly Pashtun they ruled as overlords over the 60% of Afghans from other ethnic groups. In local government, such as Kabul city council or Herat, Taliban loyalists, not locals, dominated, even when the Pashto-speaking Taliban could not communicate with the roughly half of the population who spoke Dari or other non-Pashtun tongues. Critics complained that this \"lack of local representation in urban administration made the Taliban appear as an occupying force.\"\n\nOrganization and governance\nConsistent with the governance of the early Muslims was the absence of state institutions and the absence of \"a methodology for command and control\", both of which are standard today, even in non-Westernized states. The Taliban did not issue press releases or policy statements, nor did they hold regular press conferences. The basis for this structure was Grand Mufti Rashid Ahmed Ludhianvi's Obedience to the Amir, as he served as a mentor to the Taliban's leadership. The outside world and most Afghans did not even know what their leaders looked like, because photography was banned. The \"regular army\" resembled a lashkar or traditional tribal militia force with only 25,000 men (of whom 11,000 were non-Afghans).\nCabinet ministers and deputies were mullahs with a \"madrasah education\". Several of them, such as the Minister of Health and the Governor of the State bank, were primarily military commanders who left their administrative posts and fought whenever they were needed. Military reverses that trapped them behind enemy lines or led to their deaths increased the chaos in the national administration. At the national level, \"all senior Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara bureaucrats\" were replaced \"with Pashtuns, whether qualified or not\". Consequently, the ministries \"by and large ceased to function\".\nThe Ministry of Finance did not have a budget nor did it have a \"qualified economist or banker\". Mullah Omar collected and dispersed cash without bookkeeping.\n\nEconomic activities\nThe Kabul money markets responded positively during the first weeks of the Taliban occupation (1996). But the Afghani soon fell in value. They imposed a 50% tax on any company operating in the country, and those who failed to pay were attacked. They also imposed a 6% import tax on anything brought into the country, and by 1998 had control of the major airports and border crossings which allowed them to establish a monopoly on all trade. By 2001, the per capita income of the 25 million population was under $200, and the country was close to total economic collapse. As of 2007 the economy had begun to recover, with estimated foreign reserves of three billion dollars and a 13% increase in economic growth.\n\nUnder the Transit treaty between Afghanistan and Pakistan, a massive network for smuggling developed. It had an estimated turnover of 2.5 billion dollars with the Taliban receiving between $100 and $130 million per year. These operations along with the trade from the Golden Crescent financed the war in Afghanistan and also had the side effect of destroying start up industries in Pakistan. Ahmed Rashid also explained that the Afghan Transit Trade agreed on by Pakistan was \"the largest official source of revenue for the Taliban.\"\nBetween 1996 and 1999, Mullah Omar reversed his opinions on the drug trade, apparently as it only harmed kafirs. The Taliban controlled 96% of Afghanistan's poppy fields and made opium its largest source of taxation. Taxes on opium exports became one of the mainstays of Taliban income and their war economy. According to Rashid, \"drug money funded the weapons, ammunition and fuel for the war.\" In The New York Times, the Finance Minister of the United Front, Wahidullah Sabawoon, declared the Taliban had no annual budget but that they \"appeared to spend US$300 million a year, nearly all of it on war.\" He added that the Taliban had come to increasingly rely on three sources of money: \"poppy, the Pakistanis and bin Laden.\"\nIn an economic sense it seems he had little choice, as the war of attrition continued with the Northern Alliance the income from continued opium production was all that prevented the country from starvation. By 2000, Afghanistan accounted for an estimated 75% of the world's supply and in 2000 grew an estimated 3276 tonnes of opium from poppy cultivation on 82,171 hectares. At this juncture Omar passed a decree banning the cultivation of opium, and production dropped to an estimated 74 metric tonnes from poppy cultivation on 1,685 hectares. Many observers say the ban – which came in a bid for international recognition at the United Nations – was only issued in order to raise opium prices and increase profit from the sale of large existing stockpiles. 1999 had yielded a record crop and had been followed by a lower but still large 2000 harvest. The trafficking of accumulated stocks by the Taliban continued in 2000 and 2001. In 2002, the UN mentioned the \"existence of significant stocks of opiates accumulated during previous years of bumper harvests.\" In September 2001 – before the 11 September attacks against the United States – the Taliban allegedly authorised Afghan peasants to sow opium again.\nThere was also an environmental toll to the country, heavy deforestation from the illegal trade in timber with hundreds of acres of pine and cedar forests in Kunar Province and Paktya being cleared. Throughout the country millions of acres were denuded to supply timber to the Pakistani markets, with no attempt made at reforestation, which has led to significant environmental damage. By 2001, when the Afghan Interim Administration took power the country's infrastructure was in ruins, Telecommunications had failed, the road network was destroyed and Ministry of Finance buildings were in such a state of disrepair some were on the verge of collapse. On 6 July 1999, then president Bill Clinton signed into effect executive order 13129. This order implemented a complete ban on any trade between America and the Taliban régime and on 10 August they froze £5,000,000 in Ariana assets. On 19 December 2000, UN resolution 1333 was passed. It called for all assets to be frozen and for all states to close any offices belonging to the Taliban. This included the offices of Ariana Afghan Airlines. In 1999, the UN had passed resolution 1267 which had banned all international flights by Ariana apart from preapproved humanitarian missions.\nAccording to the lawsuit, filed in December 2019 in the D.C. District Court on behalf of Gold Star families, some US defense contractors involved in Afghanistan made illegal \"protection payments\" to the Taliban, funding a \"Taliban-led terrorist insurgency\" that killed or wounded thousands of Americans in Afghanistan. In 2009, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the \"protection money\" was \"one of the major sources of funding for the Taliban.\"\nIt is estimated that in 2020 the Taliban had an income of $1.6 billion, mostly from drugs, mining, extortion and taxes, donations and exports.\nOn 2 November 2021, the Taliban required that all economic transactions in Afghanistan use Afghanis and banned the use of all foreign currency.\nIn 2022 construction on the Qosh Tepa Canal began in northern Afghanistan.\nOn 20 April 2024, the Taliban decided to abolish Afghanistan's pension system as Hibatullah Akhundzada claimed it was “un-Islamic”, which prompted protests by retirees and older veterans of the Afghan Armed Forces in Kabul. The protest was dispersed by the Taliban.\n\nInternational relations\nDuring the war, the Taliban were supported by several militant outfits which include the Haqqani network, Al-Qaeda and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. Several countries like China, Iran, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia and Saudi Arabia allegedly support the Taliban. However, all of their governments deny providing any support to the Taliban. Likewise, the Taliban also deny receiving any foreign support from any country. At its peak, formal diplomatic recognition of the Taliban's government was acknowledged by three nations: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. In the past, the United Arab Emirates and Turkmenistan were also alleged to have provided support to the Taliban. It is designated by some countries as a terrorist organization.\nDuring its time in power (1996–2001), at its height ruling 90% of Afghanistan, the Taliban régime, or Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, gained diplomatic recognition from only three states: the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, all of which provided substantial aid. The most other nations and organizations, including the United Nations, recognised the government of the Islamic State of Afghanistan (1992–2002) (parts of whom were part of the United Front, also called Northern Alliance) as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. Regarding its relations with the rest of the world, the Taliban's Emirate of Afghanistan held a policy of isolationism: \"The Taliban believe in non-interference in the affairs of other countries and similarly desire no outside interference in their country's internal affairs\".\nTraditionally, the Taliban were supported by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, while Iran, Russia, Turkey, India, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan formed an anti-Taliban alliance and supported the Northern Alliance. After the fall of the Taliban régime at the end of 2001, the composition of the Taliban supporters changed. According to a study by scholar Antonio Giustozzi, in the years 2005 to 2015 most of the financial support came from the states Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, and Qatar, as well as from private donors from Saudi Arabia, from al-Qaeda and, for a short period of time, from the Islamic State. About 54 percent of the funding came from foreign governments, 10 percent from private donors from abroad, and 16 percent from al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. In 2014, the amount of external support was close to $900 million.\nFollowing the Taliban's ascension to power, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan's model of governance has been widely criticized by the international community, despite the government's repeated calls for international recognition and engagement. Acting Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund stated that his interim administration has met all conditions required for official recognition. In a bid to gain recognition, the Taliban sent a letter in September 2021 to the UN to accept Suhail Shaheen as Permanent Representative of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan – a request that had already been rejected by the UN Credentials Committee in 2021.\nOn 10 October 2021, Russia hosted the Taliban for talks in Moscow in an effort to boost its influence across Central Asia. Officials from 10 different countries – Russia, China, Pakistan, India, Iran and five formerly Soviet Central Asian states – attended the talks, which were held during the Taliban's first official trip to Europe since their return to power in mid-August 2021. The Taliban won backing from the 10 regional powers for the idea of a United Nations donor conference to help the country stave off economic collapse and a humanitarian catastrophe, calling for the UN to convene such a conference as soon as possible to help rebuild the country. Russian officials also called for action against Islamic State (IS) fighters, who Russia said have started to increase their presence in Afghanistan since the Taliban's takeover. The Taliban delegation, which was led by Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Salam Hanafi, said that \"Isolating Afghanistan is in no one's interests,\" arguing that the extremist group did not pose any security threat to any other country. The Taliban asked the international community to recognize its government, but no country has yet recognized the new Afghan government.\nOn 23 January 2022, a Taliban delegation arrived in Oslo, and closed-door meetings were held during the Taliban's first official trip to Western Europe and second official trip to Europe since their return to power. Western diplomats told the Taliban that humanitarian aid to Afghanistan would be tied to an improvement in human rights. The Taliban delegation, led by acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, met senior French foreign ministry officials, Britain's special envoy Nigel Casey, EU Special Representative for Afghanistan and members of the Norwegian foreign ministry. This followed the announcement by the UN Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee that the committee would extend a travel ban exemption until 21 March 2022 for 14 listed Taliban members to continue attending talks, along with a limited asset-freeze exemption for the financing of exempted travel. However, the Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said that the international community's call for the formation of an inclusive government was a political \"excuse\" after the 3-day Oslo visit.\nAt the United Nations Security Council meeting in New York on 26 January 2022, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said the Oslo talks appeared to have been \"serious\" and \"genuine\". Norway says the talks do \"not represent a legitimisation or recognition of the Taliban\". In the same meeting, the Russian Federation's delegate said attempts to engage the Taliban through coercion are counter-productive, calling on Western states and donors to return frozen funds. China's representative said the fact that aid deliveries have not improved since the adoption of UNSC 2615 (2021) proves that the issue has been politicized, as some parties seek to use assistance as a bargaining chip.\nIran, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, the Russian Federation, and China were the first countries to accept the diplomatic credentials of Taliban-appointed envoys, although this is not equivalent to official recognition.\nOn 4 July 2024, the Russian president Vladimir Putin stated that Taliban is an ally of Russia in the fight against terrorism.\n\nDesignation as a terrorist organization\nThe Taliban movement is officially illegal in the following countries to date:\n\n Canada\n Russia\n Tajikistan\n United States, though not on the United States Department of State list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.\nFormer: \n\n Kazakhstan (2005–2023)\n Kyrgyzstan (2006–2024)\n\nUnited Nations and NGOs\nDespite the aid of United Nations (UN) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) given (see § Afghanistan during Taliban rule), the Taliban's attitude in 1996–2001 toward the UN and NGOs was often one of suspicion. The UN did not recognise the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, most foreign donors and aid workers were non-Muslims, and the Taliban vented fundamental objections to the sort of 'help' the UN offered. As the Taliban's Attorney General Maulvi Jalil-ullah Maulvizada put it in 1997:\n\nLet us state what sort of education the UN wants. This is a big infidel policy which gives such obscene freedom to women which would lead to adultery and herald the destruction of Islam. In any Islamic country where adultery becomes common, that country is destroyed and enters the domination of the infidels because their men become like women and women cannot defend themselves. Anyone who talks to us should do so within Islam's framework. The Holy Koran cannot adjust itself to other people's requirements, people should adjust themselves to the requirements of the Holy Koran.\nIn July 1998, the Taliban closed \"all NGO offices\" by force after those organisations refused to move to a bombed-out former Polytechnic College as ordered. One month later the UN offices were also shut down.\nAround 2000, the UN drew up sanctions against officials and leaders of Taliban, because of their harbouring Osama bin Laden. Several of the Taliban leaders have subsequently been killed.\nIn 2009, British Foreign Secretary Ed Miliband and US Secretary Hillary Clinton called for talks with 'regular Taliban fighters' while bypassing their top leaders who supposedly were 'committed to global jihad'. Kai Eide, the top UN official in Afghanistan, called for talks with Taliban at the highest level, suggesting Mullah Omar – even though Omar dismissed such overtures as long as foreign troops were in Afghanistan.\nIn 2010, the UN lifted sanctions on the Taliban, and requested that Taliban leaders and others be removed from terrorism watch lists. In 2010 the US and Europe announced support for President Karzai's latest attempt to negotiate peace with the Taliban.\n\nIn popular media\nThe Taliban were portrayed in Khaled Hosseini's popular 2003 novel The Kite Runner and its 2007 film adaption. The Taliban have also been portrayed in American film, most notably in Lone Survivor (2013) which is based on a real-life story. Hindi cinema have also portrayed the Taliban in Kabul Express (2006), and Escape from Taliban (2003) which is based on a real-life novel A Kabuliwala's Bengali Wife, whose author Sushmita Banerjee was shot dead by the Taliban in 2013.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nTaliban collected news and commentary at Al Jazeera English\nTaliban collected news and commentary at The Guardian \nTaliban collected news and commentary at The New York Times"

        "content": "The Chocolate City speech is the nickname that some people have given to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day speech by Ray Nagin, Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana, on  January 16, 2006. The speech concerned race politics in New Orleans several months after Hurricane Katrina destroyed much of the city. The reference is to the occurrence of the phrase chocolate city in Nagin's speech, which was one of several points in the speech that occasioned significant controversy and raised accusations of racism against Mr. Nagin.\n\nHistory of the phrase\nIn African American culture, the term chocolate city refers to a city with a predominantly African American population and/or African American political leadership. The concept originated with radio DJs in Washington D.C. in the early 1970s, and was popularized by the band Parliament, who released the album Chocolate City in 1975. The term has been used by scholar Cornel West in his 1993 book Race Matters and by comedian Chris Rock.\nIn an interview with Public Radio International's Tavis Smiley (originally broadcast on January 13, 2006) Nagin used the phrase \"chocolate city\" in reference to New Orleans' future demographics, a term that would become troublesome for him just a few days later.\n\nContext\nSee also Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans\nAt the end of August, 2005, New Orleans had been hit by Hurricane Katrina, and catastrophic failures of the city's Federal levees flooded the majority of the city. Only a small portion of the city's evacuated population had returned by January. Some commentators were suggesting that the city's demographics would change from majority African American to majority Caucasian.\nThis speech put the post-Hurricane Katrina recovery process of New Orleans in the context of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Nagin's speech reflected on the problems of violence and crime in pre- and post-Katrina New Orleans. He also referred to the humanitarian plight of the largely African-American hurricane victims in the Louisiana Superdome and Morial Convention Center.\n\nThe speech\nAt a Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration at City Hall New Orleans on January 16, 2006, the mayor gave a speech.\nNagin began the speech invoking spirits of Peace, Love, and Unity. He then described a talk he had with Martin Luther King Jr. earlier that morning (as King was long dead, this was presumably a metaphor or rhetorical device). Nagin then described some of the problems and suffering New Orleans had been experiencing since the hurricane, with the repeated refrain that Dr. King says \"I wouldn't like that\".\nShortly after, Nagin continued, \"We as black people, it's time, it's time for us to come together. It's time for us to rebuild a New Orleans, the one that should be a chocolate New Orleans. And I don't care what people are saying Uptown or wherever they are. This city will be chocolate at the end of the day.\"\nNagin also stated that New Orleans \"will be a majority African-American city. It's the way God wants it to be.\" As most New Orleanians knew the city had been majority African American for decades before Katrina, Ned Sublette of The Nation found the implication of Nagin claiming to know God's will more troubling than the suggested return of pre-Katrina demographics.\nIn the same speech, Nagin further stirred controversy by claiming that \"God is mad at America. He sent us hurricane after hurricane after hurricane, and it's destroyed and put stress on this country....Surely he doesn't approve of us being in Iraq under false pretenses. But surely he is upset at black America also. We're not taking care of ourselves.\" Nagin then went on to relate an imagined conversation with the deceased Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. regarding both the response to Katrina and the modern problems of black America which he believes offended God.\n\nReaction\nThe speech generated an intense reaction, much of it negative. The \"Chocolate City\" metaphor was seized on and parodied by commentators, and cartoons depicting Nagin as Willy Wonka appeared in print and on the internet. A Times-Picayune commentator suggested that Nagin had just ruined his own chances at re-election.\nPolitical commentators pointed out that while this might just have been another example of Nagin speaking off the cuff, it would likely hurt his standing among white voters.\nMany people believed the word uptown to be a coded reference to wealthy whites, such as those who lived in the old mansions on St. Charles Avenue or around Audubon Park. However, Uptown New Orleans was actually one of the most ethnically and economically diverse sections of the Metro area.  Many of Nagin's original supporters lived in Uptown. As Uptown contained the largest section of unflooded high ground in the city's East Bank at the time of the speech, Uptown had the city's largest concentration of locals back in their homes, businesses back open, and displaced New Orleanians from other more severely damaged parts of town living there. Locals protested the Mayor's comment, which some felt suggested he did not care about an important section of his city.\nNagin later attempted to explain away his remarks by offering a more racially inclusive metaphor, saying  \"How do you make chocolate? You take dark chocolate, you mix it with white milk and it becomes a delicious drink. That's the chocolate I'm talking about.\"\nNagin said that his remarks were meant to be a call for African Americans to once again return to New Orleans, despite the supposed belief that many of the people in Uptown did not want them back.\nThe Mayor apologized for the suggestion that people in Uptown were racist, noting the importance of that section of town in the city's recovery. He particularly stated regret for the statements about God. \"I don't know what happened there,\" he said. \"I don't know how that got jumbled up. That whole God thing, I don't know how that got mixed up in there.\" Nagin concluded, \"I need to be more aware and sensitive of what I'm saying... Anyone I've offended, I hope you forgive me.\"\nIn his speech at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, comedian Stephen Colbert mocked Nagin by calling Washington D.C. the \"chocolate city with a marshmallow center and a graham cracker crust of corruption.\"\n\nSee also\nRhetorical device\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nNew Orleans: The Land of Chocolate Discusses the flavor set by the chocolate metaphor."
